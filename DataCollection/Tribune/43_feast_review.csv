Service was poor when there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant for dinner. Our water glasses were never refilled throughout dinner, which is a telltale sign of bad service since it a simple task that the server didn't bother to do.

2016-11-06,1.0,"This was our first time visiting this place per a recommendation. Unfortunately, it will also be our last.  We received water bottles with a large amount of food debris in the bottom and asked for another.  The waitress kindly retrieved another, however, it could be seen that this one also had food debris in the bottom as she poured the water. After pointing this out she agreed to get another and did not return. Later, a bus boy returned with water glasses and inquired if there was a problem. While passing out the glasses of water he told us our waitress was ""crying in the back"" and ""whatever we did we shouldn't do it again"".  Asking for new water due to food debris should not be an offensive thing to someone working in the service industry, however, moreso you should never confront a customer.. especially with false accusations.  After the bus boy made such wild and false accusations I was visibly offended and asked him to repeat what he just said... which he did not. After the bus boy left we continued to observe wait staff peering around the corner at our table which was equally unprofessional.  This restaurant handles themselves very poorly and should thoroughly evaluate the fact that they work in the service industry and should be compliant with simple, reasonable customer requests.

We started with a couple of cocktails which were fun and although I don't remember which I chose it was great.

I don't think I've ever seen so much bacon on one sandwich. The fries weren't crazy awesome - kinda reminded me of fast food fries (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). I got the margherita pizza. It was just okay, not the most amazing thing I've ever had, but I don't think I would ever have such feelings over a margherita pizza anyways. Good beer list - a delirium was $9?! I'm use to seeing that listed for $12+ so that was a win. We also got a small plate of the mac and cheese! super yummy! It was definitely good for sharing. Very gooey and just what I hoped for.

2016-08-20,2.0,"Really disappointed with this place. They had zero vegetarian egg options. This place specializes in brunch, and you would expect any restaurant in Chicago to have a vegetarian omelette on their menu. The only thing they had was an omelette with both veggies and bacon - I asked if it was possible to get it without the bacon, which they did, but instead of charging me the same price, they charged me the price of the omelette PLUS 50 cents for every veggie topping. At the end of the day, the omelette I got had the exact same ingredients as the veggie/bacon omelette minus the bacon, and I was charged roughly 30% more for it. Not to point out the obvious deficiency in their menu, but I asked the hostesses what options for eggs they had for vegetarians. They just looked at each other and repeated my question as if I were a martian asking if they served martian food.... and had no answer for me....

Wanting a place with a wide-ranging menu--and having eaten at Feast a few times before with good experiences--we made a reservation and headed there for dinner on a Friday night.  Overall assessment, which makes me a little sad:  this place has slipped in quality. The restaurant was near empty throughout our visit. Despite this, service was slow. Our server appeared to also be the bartender and both responsibilities proved to be too much to handle. At the end, we waited so long for him to pick up the credit cards that we just brought them to the bar on our own. The hostess faced our table throughout the meal and stood there doing nothing even though it was obvious we were waiting for plates to be cleared, the bill, etc. Because we were a large party, gratuity was included; perhaps this is why no one seemed to be really trying? Food was meh, particularly considering the relatively expensive price point. An ""Asian salad"" lacked Asian flavor, steak was chewy and overcooked, a pork chop was dry. Overall: I still want to like it, but this visit was disappointing.

This last trip took us to the point we will never be returning.  I have worked in the restaurant business for years and I completely get the service side, especially when you're packed.  When we arrived there were 6 other tables seated and the place was surprisingly empty compared to how packed they usually are - we soon figured out why everyone is leaving Feast.  We sat down and got some waters and then waited for our server for 12 minutes.  I finally had to go to the hostess to see if we even had a server.  When she went and got him we realized he had been in the POSI station kickin it with the other servers the entire time we were waiting!  Our waiter (Cristobal) I had had before and he was bad then, but we were hungry and thought maybe he just didn't realize we were in his section or whatever.   When we ordered our drinks it took another 15 min because they were sitting at the bar waiting while he was MIA.  We finally order our food and it comes out wrong and he disappears with no check back or refills and missing items we ordered.  Finally we just ask for the check and the manager. Who would just let new customers sit at a table for that long while standing right next to them, right?  There had to be a reason?  Nope - the reason is he is an awful server and we won't be returning because of him and the other lack luster servers we have had here.

We tried Chingalingas (chorizo, eggs, and chips), built our own omelettes, while I had the Garbage omelette. Another person had one of the burgers. All breakfast items came with feast potatoes, and we all ordered sides of bacon to share. The space was sleek, bright, and welcoming. Food came out quickly with nothing messed up!

The food and drink menu options were great, but unfortunately my girlfriend and I waited so long for a server that my clothes were beginning to go out of style.  Upon arriving at Feast, we were immediately seated on the outside patio. The hostess gave us our menus and an individual filled our water glasses within a minute of sitting down.  My girlfriend and I patiently waited fifteen minutes for a server but no one ever came. We told a busser how we haven't seen a server and he told us that one is on the way. After waiting another five minutes without a server, we stopped a random server that was walking past us and asked if he would be able to take our drink order. With the amount of waiting we endured, my girlfriend and I already knew what we wanted to eat, but the random server said he was going to just take our drink order at this time. Kind of weird, but okay...  Another five minutes passed without getting our drinks. By this time, it seemed like a joke. We were over this adventure. We got up and started walking to the door to leave. On the way out, my girlfriend mentioned to the hostess how we have been sitting outside bakin' like a toasted cheese-it for the past 25 minutes and don't even know who our server is. The hostess assured us that she will find out who our server is, so we decided to give this place one more shot.  Finally, our server arrived (hallelujah!)! After apologizing and giving us our drinks, we were finally able to order our food. The food came to our table in about 15 minutes and was actually really good. I ordered the Chilaquiles. If I had to describe it, it tasted like a rich man's Frito Chili Pie. The portions were big; I rarely have scraps on my plate but I wasn't able to finish this meal. All of the food that was served looked and tasted delicious.  Look, I've worked in the restaurant industry before so I know all the crap servers have to deal with. But our server was just plain bad. Our server didn't come around to ask how our meal was (which is usually annoying but shows that the server is at least trying) and took FOR-EEVVVER on coming back once she dropped off the bill. Yet another five minutes passed with our server not showing up to pick up our bill. Thankfully, my girlfriend and I were able to scrap together enough cash to pay the bill and include a measly tip.  I would definitely rate Feast with a higher rating if the customer service wasn't so bad. I cannot recall a time when I had to wait that long for a server to arrive at my table. It's unfortunate because I really did enjoy my meal. But with this being said, I doubt I would ever come to Feast again.

I was surprised at this question, especially in a relatively fine dining restaurant where people are generally educated properly on the protocol of service dogs. This was not usual, and I told her that by law, she is not required or even supposed to ask for this proof. She quipped back that where she comes from, it is a law. Well! Yes, ma'am! Despite the fact that she was clearly grossly misinformed, I showed her this license to placate her obvious need to be right and not to mention the legitimate paranoia that my food would be contaminated if I gave her ""too much grief"" over it.

I recommend this place to anyone who will listen! Must haves: Macaroni and cheese Braised beef short ribs Chocolate brownie sundae I know the first and third items sound like standard fare, but the way Feast does them is distinct and takes these classic comfort-food choices to a new level. The mac and cheese comes with huge chunks of salted diced bacon and several other additions that make this appetizer a compelling choice as a meal on its own. The sundae is made with their very own brownie that is extremely rich and extraordinarily moist without being overwhelming or too chewy, and it's served with the ice cream (soft and not overly rich) sandwiched between two layers of brownie topped with sliced strawberries with raspberry and caramel syrups on top and a ton of whipped cream on the side so you can have exactly the amount you want.",0.9608,0.888,0.096,0.016,0.519534632034632

For those of you who are thinking thicker slices of oven roasted turkey as I was, you would be greatly mistaken. The sandwich came on a oval like bun that was just ok and the sandwich was heated in a panini press. The turkey meat looked like and tasted like Buddig's paper thin sliced turkey meat.

2015-06-08,2.0,"Yesterday, I went to Feast for brunch with a large party to celebrate the birthday of my partner, Chris. First off, let me start by saying that I found the food here to be very tasty. The eggs in my Classic Eggs Benedict dish were cooked perfectly and I quickly devoured every last bite. The Mimosa I had was delicious as well. As a whole, pretty much everyone enjoyed their food. Sadly, I feel I need to alert others about major problems with the staff and overall service.  Earlier this year, I had a couple friends tell me that Feast was a good spot for memorable food. I first contacted Maura Davis, the general manager, via email in April. I know that Sunday brunch in the city is insanely busy everywhere, so I wanted to alert her well in advance that our party would be 14 people and we wanted to dine around noon. She emailed me back saying ""Happy to accommodate your group of 14 people at noon on Sunday, June 7th."" A couple days later, I emailed Maura again because I didn't realize the restaurant had an outdoor patio, and said that weather permitting, we would prefer to be seated out there. I never received an email back from her then but I assumed it would not be an issue.  On June 6th, the day before the birthday brunch, I called the restaurant asking for Maura. The woman on the other line (whose name I do not know) asked who was calling and I gave her my spiel and asked if it would be possible to add two more people to our table. The woman put me on hold for a few seconds and came back saying that ""it will be a squeeze but we will make it work."" On June 7th, Chris and I arrived early- a little after 11:30am. The outdoor patio was closed due to morning thunderstorms.  It was disappointing, but of course, no one's fault. However, we found that our group was going to be seated at two separate tables instead of one. The tables were in a separated L formation near one of the front windows by the main entrance. I knew that no one at the restaurant had informed me there would be two tables, only that it would be a squeeze but they would make it work- making me think it would be a long table or a couple of tables put together to make a long row.  Maura Davis was working the morning of the 7th and Chris talked with her about our issue with the seating. I sat down at one of our tables and watched it play out. Apparently, Maura said that due to the weather, the staff had to improvise and that she was sorry but it was the best they could do. Chris told her that no one alerted us that it would be two tables and she said, ""Matt never gave a cell phone number where we could reach him."" Chris replied by saying, ""Well, you had his email."" Should I have given my cell number? In hindsight, absolutely. I didn't even think to leave my digits at the time. On the restaurant website, it states that Maura can be contacted by email so I stuck with that. After all this, I believe phone numbers should be requested by staff for every reservation and especially for larger parties, in the event that something unexpected happens. Chris was annoyed with the way Maura was talking to him; even though she was apologizing, she had some attitude and it came across as ""You should be thanking us that we got you in here."" If our party had just randomly stumbled into Feast without a reservation, I could understand the staff being upset. However, I had planned this outing well in advance, and they had plenty of time to let me know configurations/possible scenarios to avoid any chaos.  After Chris sat down at one of our tables, Maura's face and neck were red as a fire engine. Soon, she disappeared; never to be seen by us that day again. After everyone in our party arrived, we moved one of the tables a bit closer to the other. The hostesses sneered. We took quick notice of our female server. Disinterested and cold, we knew it was not going to be good. She barely was around the whole time and one of our friends asked another random person on the staff, ""Does our waitress need to get fired so I can get a drink?"" He had been waiting 10-15 minutes. Empty glasses sat on the table forever. The food came out fairly quickly, which stunned us all. Our waitress managed to gobble up the 20% gratuity that was tacked onto our bill. She knew she would get it and so she didn't work. Disgusting.  I really wanted to like Feast.

2015-05-01,1.0,"I've frequented Feast on many occasions & my most recent visits have resulted in less than stellar experiences. Firstly, why do they make you wait for your entire party to be present? Especially when it's not extraordinarily crowded? If the rest of my party is there within a few minutes (5-10) what should it matter if I'm already sitting at the table we're all going to be seated at, enjoying a beverage & maybe an appetizer? I guess the owners think waiting is better than having your guests seated & spending money?!?!? And let's get to the food . . . I ordered a chopped salad & asked for a couple of things to not be included. What I didn't ask for was brown lettuce that looked like it came from a 3-day old bag of lettuce; or the few other ""chopped"" salad items thrown in at the bottom of the bowl; or an overabundance of sliced radishes that looked like they had been kept out of water & the refrigerator. Now that I think about it, my salad looked like it had already been picked over by someone else & it belonged in the bus bin, not served to me. I said nothing because I was hungry & quite frankly I was worried what might come in its place.  If you're looking for fresh, vibrant, simple food, keep looking. It appears to me that their quality standards & control (in my opinion after several visits) has most definitely slipped. I believe Feast isn't the place you want to feast at.

2015-03-09,1.0,"Without question, the greatest embarrassment of all Wicker Park dinning establishments.  Horrible food, mediocre service (at best) in a dinning room that was tired and outdated when I first dined in it in 2006.   The owners own the small group of Goddess and Grocer stores as well, which are just lovely - I do not shop at them because I can cook, and the rest of what they have you can purchase for less money within a few blocks.  Apparently, some people have a hard time making dinner themselves and are so desperate for convenience that they are willing to sacrifice all of their senses -  I guess Goddess and Grocer fits that niche market(?)...   Anyways...  These guys should just focus on the successful grocery/convenient/take-out/eat-in concept and PLEASE for the love of God and all things good sell Feast so someone who knows how to run a restaurant can take over the space.    On my last visit my wife and I had a meal that was so unmemorable that all I can recall was a horrifically bad (obviously frozen) ravioli dish with butternut squash, swimming in brown butter, old sage and some other junk (I must have been out of my mind ordering a dish that was interesting during the Clinton administration - but I did), a salad that was kinda warm which we only ate a little of out of fear... dirty glasses, dirty silverware (its not hard to add polishing silverware to a side-work list), a wobbly table, mediocre service and then diarrhea.  We left 20% out of pity (she was nice and seemed sad). On Wednesdays they have ""$15 All You Can Eat Mussels""...  if that doesn't scream HELP, I don't know what does.  Also...  enjoy the mussels on Thursday and Friday and Saturday from what they did not sell Wednesday.  ""Specials"" are one thing...  but giving away food to suck people in for a quick pop in revenue tells you things - why do they need to do this?!  Oh...  because business is so bad on these days that they need to coax people in to spend money.  It is a sign of failure, which pleases me - just please do not buy into it as a consumer.  ""All you can eat"" means, ""the cheapest we can get"" and ""half off wine"" means ""please GOD order food because our staff is broke and we are paying our bills from other sources""...      I would say...  fire everyone, get a new chef, etc??  Nope - we are far passed that point.   If they have any loyal guests I would imagine they are the same types who frequent their Goddess and Grocer stores - cannot cook, care little for their senses and refuse to walk an extra block for something better.        I will not bash this place anymore...  This is just an honest review in hopes that they put the key in the door and sell that space to someone who will CLEAN it, remodel and actually cook real food.  The neighborhood has developed a lot, and these guys are still in 2002...  time to pull the plug - it is not a Chicago institution...  at this point it is nothing more than a cancer.",0.9261,0.771,0.125,0.104,0.5604598617756512

We were deciding between Dove's Luncheonette or Feast as we were driving west on north ave. We made a right toward Feast but in retrospect should have made a left to try out Doves. Sorry.  It was just disappointing to see that not much had changed. They lost that little bar area in the middle. Repainted. Probably recovered the banquette. New furniture maybe? Refinished blackboard?  French doors on the east side of the restaurant. But the menu was the same. Saw the same old chilaquiles and black bean burger. No specialty pancakes scribbled on the blackboard but the waitress casually mentioned a chocolate chip one. Chocolate chip? Not something fancy like pumpkin creme brûlée or coconut flan with purple macadamia nuts and unicorn dust? I could get chocolate chip at IHOP. Jusy seemed a bit anticlimactic. Ordered the trout salad. That was new I think. Arugula. Smoked trout. Lemon ricotta and vinaigrette. It was delicious. With crispy potatoes thrown in there. It was delicate but after a while it got to ""trouty"". Too much fish. Too smoky. I wish it had a bit more arugula to balance it out. The hubs got the burger. The first few bites were delicious. Soft brioche bun. Tender burger cooked a little over but still had good texture. Chunks of bacony savoriness with sweet carmelized onions almost like a jam. I liked it but only had a bite while the hubs said by the end got to be too sweet. The kids split a grilled cheese. Nothing remarkable. Overcooked  that the cheese became hard. Ugh.  Service lacked a bit. Never got a refill on my coffee. And had to play chicken with the oncoming traffic of the busboys coming down the narrow hallway to the women's restroom.

2015-02-16,2.0,"I've been back countless times since my original review, but Friday night was pretty disappointing. We live close by and my BF kept suggesting we come here for dinner. I was never overly impressed with the dinner menu so I kept saying no. BUT, we noticed that they recently closed for a few days and got a new head chef/menu tweak so I said - why not! Ugh, what a waste of $90!  I think they were providing extra's because it was valentines day weekend, but it didn't work. They gave us an amuse bouche, which consisted of flat bread (that was still dough on the inside, literally dough) and a white bean dip. The dip wasn't bad - I couldn't stomach eating the bread. It was still stretchy!! For our mains, I ordered the mussels, which sounded very nice and my boyfriend ordered the fish. I couldn't eat my mussels. The broth was SOO salty that it was literally inedible. I tried, I ate a few, and I just couldn't! The waitress was so great and took them back without question. I replaced them with the black bean burger, which was good. My boyfriends fish was great. We were ready to go and the waitress offered us a free dessert to make up for the salty mussels. We didn't really want it, but it was definitely a nice gesture. The last touch of their freebies was a half glass of champagne with a sweet heart candy on the bottom. It was not good. We received the bill and noticed that we had been overcharged by the wine and the host was so nice to fix the mistake. But, again, it was just another bump in the road for us that night at Feast.  I think the place is struggling - the dining room was half empty on a Friday night. I think they are trying too hard to be something they are not. I was super disappointed with our meal here and to spend $90 on a black bean burger and a fish dish plus drinks just seems excessive!

2015-02-14,5.0,"Last night, my friend and I celebrated our very own Galentine's Day feast at Feast. To start with, we ordered the 2 cocktails on their Valentine's Day menu. Feast has been revamping their drinks list in an effort to become a neighborhood place that you think of for cocktails as well as food. And they're well on their way. The Love On The Rocks cocktail with Moscato, strawberry puree, and a splash of ginger beer was light and sweet and perfect to start with. The Love Bites cocktail was a great blend of tequila, mango puree, and Prosecco, with a nice tart finish provided by the lime wedge. I'd tell them to keep both on the menu long after Valentine's Day! Next came the apps. Our favorites were the caramelized onion buttermilk biscuits which were served with Amish blue cheese (that I'm determined to find in a Whole Foods around here!) and honey butter. If I had a better metabolism, I would eat these biscuits every damn day. They were light and flavorful and with the heavenly butter and cheese, they were perfect. We also tried the char grilled baby octopus with Romesco sauce and a chili oregano vinaigrette. This dish was a little heavy handed with the vinegar but the octopus was cooked just right; it wasn't rubbery and nearly melted in your mouth. The Feast salads are the hit of the lunch crowd and we could see why. The Toasted Barley salad featured medjool dates, pickled shallots, candied pecans, and a lemon vinaigrette. And the House-Smoked Trout salad had crispy potatoes (think mini fried mashed potato balls), lemon ricotta, and that same lemon vinaigrette. These were probably the best salads I've ever tried. They were full of flavor, played around with different textures, and were perfectly blended. They'd be a satisfying meal in and of themselves. No boring salad fare here! We added a few more cocktails from the regular menu to the mix while we waited for our mains to arrive. First was the Throwback: New Amsterdam gin, Campari, sweet vermouth, lime, and a basil syrup. The Campari was pretty overpowering in this drink so it wasn't my favorite. But it was the Feast version of the Negroni so it's understandable that it would have a very bitter forward taste. We also tried the Chicago Style, a refreshing cocktail with Jameson, lime, and Goose Island spicy ginger beer. And one of our favorites was The Saint (also a brilliant Val Kilmer movie). It had Saint Germaine (my favorite), Prosecco, and orange. Simple and delicious. Although I was already full by this point, you don't go to taste a new menu with a weak stomach. So we powered on to the main courses. From the Valentine's Day menu, we chose the Seared Scallops with spaghetti squash and apple risotto, crab butter, and an apple and chervil salad. The scallops were superbly cooked and the risotto, typically a heavy dish, came off as a very light accompaniment with that acidic apple flavor. We also ordered the smoked house-made meatloaf (a combination of beef and pork) served with buttermilk mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and a brown onion gravy. The meatloaf tasted NOTHING like my mother's (not that that's a bad thing). It was very rich and the carrots gave it a balancing sweetness. The red chili braised short ribs with soft goat cheese white polenta and an herb salsa verde were good. But the highlight of our main course were the crispy semolina cakes. Who would have thought that two carnivores would enjoy the vegetarian dish so much!? They tasted both light and hearty at the same time somehow. And the earthy mushroom ragu that was served over the top of the cakes was so good, I could have drank it as a soup. This was definitely our favorite dish and I'm glad I saved some to take home so that I can enjoy it again soon! Finally, what kind of tasting menu is complete without a shot at dessert? The Valentine's Day dessert appealed to me the most: butterscotch pot de creme with a brown sugar shortbread cookie. The top of the pot de creme was a super sweet butterscotch mousse and beneath that was a rich chocolate mousse. We also had the caramel apple pie a la mode from the regular dessert menu and we were both blown away by this one. The cinnamon streusel topping,  julienned green apple slices, caramel sauce, and vanilla ice cream on top of the flaky warm crust all came together to make some of the best bites of apple pie I've ever had. I know I sound like I exaggerate a lot and it's true that my palate might not be as refined as some others. But I'm not lying when I say that you will be blown away by this apple pie. I was so stuffed that I had to stop after a few bites, but you bet your booty I took the rest home to salivate over this weekend! Happy Valentine's Day to me!

The waiter was somewhat inattentive and short with us. He wasn't rude, he just didn't check in with us when he should have and seemed to be in a hurry. This could be the quality of employee, or maybe the restaurant had too few people working. I'm leaning toward the former since there really weren't all that many people dining in.  The other thing...I ordered an iced chai latte, which typically consists of milk and some sort of chai concentrate. What he brought back had espresso, like it were a latte. I brought this up when I was able to catch him, and he said that their chai is a powder or something that they mix in? He also said he made it himself, so I think he made a latte and put some of that mix in it. It was bad and weird.

The bar isn't epic or over-the-top, but rather a supplement to their food. The two Jack and Gingers I ordered were pretty straightforward and good. It's the food that brings you back to Feast. I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a certain genre of food they serve there because there isn't one thing they focus on. That being said, I have tried their dates, calamari, and pizza, as well as their whitefish the two separate times I've been. Everything that I've tried has been great.

So loud that I kept scanning the room looking for children since it sounded like we were in a playground. I don't think so, not on date night. We asked to be moved to the bar where it was empty and quiet. The waiter politely complied. I ordered the Summerthyme Collins and dude had a beer. The cocktail was delicious but weak. For appetizers we had the Thai soup and the Coconut Curry quesadillas. The soup was delicious but it was something I could easily look up online and make a home for under $10. The quesadillas were sad! impossible to eat with your hands (they kept falling apart) and they tasted like something out of the ethnic frozen aisle at Jewel. Not impressed!

When our server did come, he was EXTREMELY rude. He didn't ask us how we were doing or introduce himself, and he had a very bad attitude. He took out drink order and then acted irritated that we didn't know what we wanted to eat yet. He also rolled his eyes at us. Horrified by the service we received so far, we decided to leave immediately.  There is nothing worse than giving your money to an establishment and personnel who clearly don't care about the service level they are providing their guests with.

That's where Feast comes in. I've taken many of my friends here for the first time and they all leave praising my name for introducing them to their new favorite brunch spot in Wicker Park!  My go-to meal is the build your own omelette with mozzarella cheese, caramelized onions and avocado! Of course choosing the breakfast potatoes to accompany my omelette creation.

Many times the restaurant has been busy so I snag a spot at the bar (first come first serve) and no matter how busy it is, the bartenders are always super nice!!  On a random Monday, I went in around 2:30 p.m. craving my omelette.

They welcomed me with open arms and everyone was super friendly and made my experience a team effort. The manager grabbed my first drink and put my omelette order in, the food runner promptly brought me my meal and made sure I was all set to dig in, and both the manager and bartender checked in on how I was doing throughout scarfing it down. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is because I haven't tried enough breakfast options or any of their dinner options to give the 5 star seal.

2014-07-07,1.0,"I dined at Feast last week with my family, who were in town visiting for Fourth of July weekend, and it was the most terrible dining experience I've had in recent memory. I made a reservation for 6 at 8:30 pm, and even I was surprised to be able to find a table for such a large party so easily on a holiday weekend. However, when we arrived for our reservation, there were no tables available that could seat more than 4, so my party had to split up, even though we'd taken the time to make a reservation. Once seated, it took 15 minutes for someone other than the busser to greet us. I saw only one server for the packed patio, a woman, who didn't say hello or come over to tell us the specials, until out walked my server, a blond guy. He took our drink orders without writing anything down, then proceeded to do the same with his other 3-4 tables. I wasn't surprised when he came back to ask my mother and sister what they had ordered--after dropping off the rest of the tables' drinks.  When we ordered dinner, including an appetizer for myself, which he said would be ""right out,"" he again took the dinner orders for every other table in his section before disappearing again. My beer came and went, my family's drinks did the same, and nothing from this guy. At one point, he checked on another table and made eye contact with me before turning around and going back in the restaurant. I kid you not a busser finally came over to say ""sorry for the long wait"" before I realized we'd been sitting there for an hour. I asked the female server, if she could just get us our check, and she said she'd bring over the manager. Did the manager come? No. My server did, making excuses for the delays, offering free dessert, and a bunch of other lip service before finally handing over the check, which I paid and left.  I cannot tell you how disappointing this experience was--for my family, who just wanted a night out in Chicago, and for me, who was mortified by the entire experience.

Coffee, tea or orange juice were also included, a bit unusual as these are sometimes additional charge items at other places.  We had reservations so did not wait and had our choice of outside or in; it was a bit loud inside, but the place was full and it was Easter.  Service was spot on with lots of help in cleaning up, serving and wrapping up our leftovers.  The restaurant is very cheery inside with lots of light and it is two storefronts plus an outside area, so it is rather large, but we did not feel overwhelmed.

The vegetable benedict was really good - well cooked veggies, held together in the dish, just a well thought out meal. The crab benedict, not so much. The jalapeno cornbread, which I was excited about just tasted burnt - maybe too much grill time to warm it up? The crab cake wasn't very flavorful, and the chipotle hollandaise was forgettable. Best part about the meal? the potatoes. They are awesome. Randomly sized, well crisped, very filling - just what the doctor ordered. The service left a little to be desired. There were a couple of bus-boys running around with coffee and water, which is a great idea and helped keep us hydrated.

2014-03-06,2.0,"I had a gift card for Feast and had been wanting to try it out for a long time. My bf and I came on a Saturday night and were given a table right away. The place was busy but not packed. The busboy gave us water and place settings right away. We looked through the menu, made our choices and started the wait for the server, around 10 minutes. While waiting I notice that the other servers were greeting tables that were seated after us with bread and butter. Our waitress finally showed up without any bread or butter, had time to only take our appetizer order and left. When she came back to take our dinner order, I had to ask her for bread. We ordered the beef tenderloin (medium rare) which was a special for the night and the short ribs. For appetizer we had the friend calamari, which were good but needed some lemon. When the dinner arrived the first thing I did was check the temperature of the steak, which was medium well to well done. I called the waitress over and asked her to have the steak recooked. She took it away and in the mean time we shared the short ribs while awaiting for the rest of the dinner. The short ribs were okay, nothing special. When the steak arrived, one side of it was burned and the other side of it was rare. It was not evenly cooked on the inside either as the burned side was well done and the rare side was rare. At this point I didn't feel like replacing it again and we decided to eat it. It was accompanied by chard, sauteed with bacon and apples that were extremely salty to the point of being inedible. The mashed potatoes that were mixed in, were okay but we had to pick though the salty stuff to get to them.  The server was nowhere to be seen in order for her to notice that something was wrong. We told the busboy who picked up the half eaten plate but I don't know if he informed the server. At this point, I really wished there was a manager somewhere to be seen that I could have spoken to regarding the food.  The waitress came back handed us the check and then asked us if we wanted dessert. I guess she expected that we are not staying for dessert.  Overall it was a horrible service. I did work as a server for twelve years and to me this kind of experience is unacceptable. Even TGIF sends the manager if something is wrong with your food, it is common sense to ensure that the customer is satisfied the second time around especially when it is your first time (we told that to the server). My review may sound that I am picky but I really am not. We don't go out much since my bf travels and when we do, we hope for good experience.

I love great food but I don't go around reviewing them after each dine in.  I have restaurant experience as a server, busser, host, take out, you name it, from the best to the worst. I like to think I have some idea how a dining experience should go for a customer.  Location- damen. Obviously this area is poppin and that's why they expanded, so it's a great spot. The restaurant itself was actually decently spaced and ok looking. Server- Emma. She was terrible. I'll never come back here again because of her and her again. She was so slow, showed no urgency, clearly she hated her job, and she just didn't care at all about us or anyone for that fact. I tipped her well because I was a server for a decent amount of time, but damn ... Even my gf who told me to quit complaining, said she was terrible too. She didn't check on us to see how our food was, and she was just plain rude. I won't blab on, but even a beginner server with no experience at all is better than her.

I used to live down the block and really miss being able to walk here.  The patio is one of my favorites in the area and I have never waited more than 15 minutes to be seated without a reservation.  I've been here dozens of times because it is consistently great food and reasonably priced. I usually order the one of the benedict options (crab and eggs are my two favorites) which comes with their breakfast potatoes.  I love those potatoes!  Smoothies are decent but sometimes the ice isn't blended very well. We see the same wait staff almost every time and have never had any issues.  The hostesses have always been kind and service is good, but I agree you may need to flag someone down for coffee after your food arrives.   There is currently a Groupon deal!  Get it while you can!",0.943,0.838,0.125,0.037,0.47465277777777787

We woke up jonesing for their benedicts (one of the few things I suck at cooking, I'll admit) and decided to head over before my eyebrow appt next door within the hour. We were seated immediately at the bar and I popped my breakfast-bar-eating cherry because I've always sat at the tables prior to this. From now on, I will definitely choose the bar route. The bartender was ridiculously quick with our grown-up very berry smoothie ($8) and in less than 5 minutes of ordering our eggs portobello (for me) and steak benedict (for him), it was in front of our faces. Coffee was strong and the food was perfect as usual.  The things that usually annoy me about this place (stroller city and barking dogs) can be avoided at the bar. You also get to stare at all the liq bottles, cute couches with a ""fireplace"" which I much prefer over a screaming baby.  We were in and out in less than 40 min and this was with us chit-chatting, having multiple coffees and taking our sweet time. Having such a quick, delicious brunch is tough to find in Chicago and this will always be one my top brunch choices for this reason.

We stood near the bar and looked over the menu. While waiting, room opened up at the bar but we figured we'd be called soon anyways. We were seated shortly after that. I could have gotten so many different things on the menu, but settled on the breakfast croissant sandwich. My boyfriend and friend got the garbage omelette. Their omelettes were HUGE! Easily could be split between two people. They must have been delicious, though, because they both ate the whole thing. My croissant was absolutely perfect. It was exactly what I wanted and just enough to fill me up but not leave me feeling absolutely disgusting after. The potatoes are solid breakfast potatoes, nothing amazing, but definitely good.

We had great attentive service that came to fill our drinks and bottomless coffee every 5ish minutes. I ordered the burger and it came piping hot with perfectly crisp bacon. The burger was so fresh, I could see the steam coming out of the inside after the first bite. Oh and the burger was 8 oz- plenty of meat! Along with the burger came sweet potato fries at no extra charge like other places and they were some of the best I've had (great texture and well seasoned).

I started with a hot cup of Intelligentsia coffee and soy milk-- coffee is bottomless! We ordered  the Benedict trio as well as a burger with sweet potato fries.  The food came pretty quickly, and was delicious and literally steaming hot .  My boyfriend loved his burger (he kept talking about how it's an 8 oz patty instead of 6 ounces, if that matters to any of you), and the sweet potato fries were some of the best I've had.  The Benedict trio was a TON of food, with my favorite being the crab cake variation.  The crabcake is moist and not too fishy, and instead of being served on an English muffin, it's served on a corn-breadish type cake, which sounds weird but works very well with the dish. Next time I might skip the smoked salmon Benedict (it was a little bit too salty for me) and get the crabcake or regular eggs Benedict instead. Our server was very attentive as well, and we enjoyed the home-y inviting feel of the restaurant.  The atmosphere was cozy and warm, and the decor was festive for the holidays.  I will be back soon, but I also hope to try the patio in the summer!

2013-12-01,4.0,"Came to Feast on a Sunday afternoon with a few friends. They reside in the area, and after researching Yelp/taking in suggestions from my friends,we decided on Feast. We initially called and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. We arrived and there were plenty of empty tables. Our table started with some drinks: coffee, bloody mary, and the sangria. I stuck with the standard water. I was in a breakfast mood, so I went that route. My brother and co yelper did the same. Our 2 other friends decided on Sandwiches. One went with the chicken club, and the other went with the burger. They both seem to enjoy their dishes. As for my dish, I built my  own omelette with egg whites, roasted peppers, roasted tomatoes, spinach, and mozzarella cheese. My brother had an omelette with eggs and other assorted veggies. You are allowed 3 ingredients, .75 per extra one. There was an extra charge for egg whites, and a 2.25 upcharge for fruit instead of potatoes, which we both did. The food came out after a 15 minute wait, and it was very good. The food was 5 star in my opinion. Omelette was picturesque (and of course I didn't take one). The fruit cup was solid. My brother and I also split a side of chicken apple sausages, which were excellent as well. So why 4 stars? Well, as stated in other reviews, the service at this establishment is subpar. My brother is a very fast coffee drinker, and he had to ask repeatedly for refills. He's not overbearing, but after our food arrived, our drinks became an afterthought. My water wasn't filled after our food was delivered either. Another friend joined us and he ordered a peach martini. Out of the 5 of us, only one of us is gay, and he was the one who ordered the bloody mary, not the sangria or foo foo orange drink. I was satisfied with my Feast experience. When we asked to have the bill split, the waiter looked at us as if we were crazy. Why is this so hard? So to make it easier on him, we used 3 cards to split the 82 dollar bill. We wanted x y and z charged to each card, and he was still confused. Maybe it's just me, but splitting the check might have been easier on him. Overall, a solid breakfasty/brunch place on Damen. The prices aren't outrageous either. If I'm in the neighborhood again, I might stop by. I was glad to support them on Small Business Saturday. They also have a nice outdoor space, and my friends are considering renting it out for a party in the summer. We will see!",0.9873,0.834,0.12,0.046,0.5708823529411765

I got in touch with my friends and they made some awesome suggestions. After getting to my friends place, we decided that Feast would be the least of our worries...so we headed to Wicker Park (I think) and were excited for the culinary adventure that would follow. These weekend brunch spots are perfect for my friends and I. I love eggs, meat, and coffee. My friends love alcohol, a good sandwich, and burgers. We got the best of both worlds.  The coffee here is Intelligensia (the best) so that was a good start. Our waters were refilled (but not as fast as I'd like) so that was unfortunate. Same thing with coffee. My friends enjoyed their sangria and bloody mary drinks. Among the items ordered: a burger, a BLT, some omelettes, and apple chicken sausage. The food was five stars...no doubt. The service made me knock this place down a star. I wanted to give four stars...but I couldn't. This is for primarily two reasons: 1. The service 2. The splitting of checks (or lack there of) Why do places have so much of an issue splitting checks? There was five of us and contrary to popular belief most people don't carry a lot of cash.

I then proceeded to wait an extraordinary amount of time for my check, finally getting up and going to the front to pay.  While the host staff was extremely nice and ran my credit card, I was disappointed that nobody thought to ask WHY I had to come to the host stand to get my check and pay. I will admit it was a moderately busy day, but when I asked the host if they were understaffed, the answer was no.  There was no other reason why I could explain the poor customer service, but I think it would be worthwhile for a manager to take a look at the floor during a busy shift to see if there are any tables with expressions of extreme annoyance on their face.

Especially when it's not extraordinarily crowded? If the rest of my party is there within a few minutes (5-10) what should it matter if I'm already sitting at the table we're all going to be seated at, enjoying a beverage & maybe an appetizer? I guess the owners think waiting is better than having your guests seated & spending money?!?!? And let's get to the food . . . I ordered a chopped salad & asked for a couple of things to not be included. What I didn't ask for was brown lettuce that looked like it came from a 3-day old bag of lettuce; or the few other ""chopped"" salad items thrown in at the bottom of the bowl; or an overabundance of sliced radishes that looked like they had been kept out of water & the refrigerator. Now that I think about it, my salad looked like it had already been picked over by someone else & it belonged in the bus bin, not served to me. I said nothing because I was hungry & quite frankly I was worried what might come in its place.  If you're looking for fresh, vibrant, simple food, keep looking.

He got the chopped salad.  It was awful, no bones about it.  Very dry chicken, tasteless dressing, too few and too limp veggies.  I bet Applebee's does a chopped salad better.  Seriously not good. I had the mac n cheese and a side of green salad!  Green salad was everything the chop wasn't: a reasonable price ($5, it's a side salad, but his salad had the same amount of romaine as mine had mixed greens), a tasty and flavorful dressing (miso?  ginger?  slightly asian-y) with just the right amount, and a fresh flavor (yum carrots).  The Feast Mac and Cheese is heavenly.  Filled with bacon, sundried tomatoes, and green onions, it's got a beautiful and fun texture that interrupts the lovely creamy sauce (like a very very cheesy alfredo).  Lots of cream, lots of parmesan, lots of yumminess.  I rate it over Mac's and under Bedford's mac and cheeses.  Oh and it's topped with these awesome toasted breadcrumbs!  And it uses the big spiral noodles which are the correct thing for mac and cheese. When you think of mac n cheese you normally thing big bowl of creamy goopy deliciousness in an unbroken chain of sauce.  This is the opposite.  Filled with so many things and so much stuff.  If you're the type of person who hates it when grilled cheese has things in it (tomatoes, or ham, or caramelized onions, or spinach, or mmmmm) then you'll hate this mac and cheese.  Otherwise it's the bomb dot com.

No salad for one with a few pieces of chicken and veggies should be $16 and $7 for a kids meal is a complete rip off.  We'll think twice before going back for dinner.  The only reason I gave this review two stars instead of one is because the food tastes fine, its not revolting, which if it was I would have given it a one-star rating.",-0.5806,0.897,0.042,0.061,0.5489711934156378

It came with mashed sweet potatoes as well as fried sweet potato crisps topping the chop itself. That is way too much sweet potato for one plate. That was a pity because the chop also came with Brussels sprouts. Normally I find these the most foul of all veges, but Feast did something to make them palatable. So maybe chill with the sweet potatoes guys. Of all the dishes we tried the fish tacos were the most appealing and if I were to return I'd try those.

They gave us different types of bread/rolls to start off with. Maybe we were just REALLY hungry, but the butter that came with those rolls was divine! Seriously, best butter ever! We started off with the bruschetta trio for appetizer. All three pieces of bruschetta came with different toppings. I had the one with Persian feta and roasted tomato --- DELICIOUS! My brother-in-law and I were craving burgers (maybe it was the beer at the game because I rarely ever crave it) but that's all I wanted, so I didn't even bother looking at the rest of the menu.

I have never had a bad meal there, and their food is consistently good. Prices are very reasonable for the quality and portion sizes. Cozy atmosphere and the spacious patio is great in summer months. Favorites I've had a few times are: won ton napoleon (agree with it being one of the best appetizers ever!) barbeque salmon, panko-crusted chicken and the sautéed whitefish. If you're looking for something hearty, the stuffed chicken breast is great, as well as the butternut squash ravioli which is on the sweet side. Definitely check out the half-priced bottles of wine on Mondays and Tuesdays, they have a great selection! One quick heads up, double check their hours on the weekend with the valet parking staff. Closing time was not posted, and when we went back to pick up a car, we encountered a very rude valet attendant basically asking us where the h*** we'd been. (We'd only been gone an hour and there was no sign listing hours of operation.) When we handed him our ticket, I could swear he upped the parking price. (Pretty sure it was less than $15.)

2012-07-15,5.0,"I don't know if I was starving or I've just had awful food and service lately (I've been living in Augusta, GA) or if a simple croissant sandwich from Feast was truly one of the best things I've ever eaten, but at that moment in time, I couldn't think of anything in the world that would have tasted better than that rich, buttery, salty solution to my hunger. I started the meal with a bloody Mary, which again, I'm not sure if I was just ridiculously thirsty, but it was one of the best bloodies I've ever had.  It was a bit strange that they didn't have any pickles since there is a full bar there.  Maybe the decade I spent in Wisconsin causes me to assume that restaurants automatically just have a spare stock of pickled vegetables that the hundreds of farmers produce with their extra unsold vegetables.  I don't think their lack of pickled vegetables warrants losing a star though.  It's not like they didn't have ketchup, which actually is a product I used to have to beg for at my pretentious usual Wisconsin restaurants that thought they were above serving that deliciously unhealthy salty and sweet processed crack-infused tomato product. Then after finishing half of my bloody Mary that went down way too quickly, the meal arrived.  I ordered the breakfast croissant scrambled eggs, prosciutto, roasted tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, arugula + feast potatoes.  I subbed the scrambled eggs for eggs over easy, a very good decision on my part (if you have an aversion to runny eggs, I'm sure scrambled would be just fine).   Before I knew it, I had finished every last bite and slurped up any extra yolk on my plate.  (I am not a big eater, I ALWAYS leave food on my plate).  The only reason I didn't finish the potatoes is because I think my stomach would have exploded for lack of room.  I suppose to add a little extra nutrition, you could sub the potatoes for a green salad, but who's trying to be healthy at brunch?  Besides, I had all the veggies I needed in my bloody Mary.  I am very surprised to read former reviews that thought the potatoes were boring.  With all the flavor in my sandwich, all I needed was a little S&P and they were cooked perfectly, of course, served with ketchup on the side which I will NEVER say I'm embarrassed to love. During all this time, our stealth waiter somehow managed to get everything done quickly and efficiently without even being seen or heard.  It was amazing.   I had an awesome experience at Feast.  I love leaving a restaurant like that, and I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Chicago.",0.991,0.735,0.162,0.103,0.5204095238095239

The eggs benedict is insanely good.  They literally smother those eggs in hollandaise and I wouldn't have it any other way! I love places that go heavy on the sauce! :) Also, the eggs were cooked to my definition of perfection..which is super runny. If I had it my way, people would only eat the yolks...which also explains my high cholestorol. The potatoes are also delicious-- big chunks with just the right amount of salt.  My recommendation: Go across to LuluLemon across the street on Sunday at 10am for community yoga and then stroll over here and drowned yourself in hollandaise! Sounds like a perfect Sunday to me!

Light bites weren't going to cut it, so I was very happy to find that the portions were quite generous and the food was very delicious. We were seated immediately when we arrived and service was great. Our waitress was friendly, brought what we needed when we needed it, and never rushed us at a busy Sunday brunch time. I was also happy to find they have a Gluten-Free menu. It's not very extensive, but it's better than nothing. My friend Katy M. seemed very impressed with the chicken skewers and salad. We split two pitchers of their Spicy Bloody Mary. It wasn't that spicy, but Cholula Hot Sauce on hand did the trick. It was served with a plethora of garnishes and I happily gnawed on celery while waiting for the main event. I am a lover of breakfast foods, so I went with the Eggs Benedict Trio - Traditional, Crab Cake & Salmon. Each of them had a distinct flavor and I absolutely loved the Traditional and the Salmon. The Crab Cake was OK and fun to try, but I would probably stick with one of the other two next time. I wasn't a fan of the Caviar, so I'll ask for that to be left out in the future. They came with a side of House Potatoes that were pretty decent. Feast is a fabulous little place with a wonderful open patio that we greatly appreciated during this freakishly amazing March weather.

We got there at about 12:30pm on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, after Bongo Room down the street had a 1+ hour wait. So we were happy that they told us their wait was only 15-20 min but we ended up waiting longer than this.  Food was pretty good. We started with the Feast Mac N Cheese. I thought this was the best thing we got in our meal. Very creamy and delicious and the bacon bits were big a nice touch. 2 coffees that were refilled once. Server was pretty inattentive, I needed silverware and never was asked so I ended up grabbing them myself from the waiter station. Runners brought us out our food so really our waiter just came back one time during the entire meal. Not a big deal, we were deep into our food and conversation anyway, but just a heads up.  I got the Crabs Benedict. It was good, a little spicy but should be expected from the description. Crab cakes were good and the Chipotle Hollandaise was excellent. Friend got the BLT with avocado and cheese. Not really my cup of tea, but it didn't look that great. It was a huge sandwich, 3 layers and had to be broken up to be eaten. Sweet potato fries were delicious, however. Meal was $45 and we felt like we didn't even eat that much.  First time I cam I had the Benedict trio and this was delicious. If you're drinking, it will get pricey as well. Pitcher of Bloody Mary is around $30 I think. They have a ton of great stuff on their menu so not sure the 3 stars justifies all through food, just their breakfast menu. I think next time I will opt for something off their lunch/dinner menu instead. Overall, a pretty good brunch spot in Wicker Park.",0.9974,0.717,0.232,0.051,0.5889550264550263

My husband and I both ordered the ""garbage omlette"" and I have to say - it was really not that good. It was huge, but even the sheer size didn't make up for the poor taste. The veggies, instead of being fresh and crisp, were overcooked and limp and did not have a good flavor with the omelette. There was really no bacon to speak of, and the sausage didn't taste good either. Overall it was a huge disappointment, and probably the only omlette I've ever had that I really did not like. The potatoes on the side were not much better, and I only had a few bites before giving up altogether. Apparently this place is pretty ""hit or miss"" with the food - the french toast that our friends had looked and tasted delicious (although very rich and sweet).

For entrees we had the Eggs Royale - very runny and fishy and the Eggs Portobello - sent back since the egg was overcooked and the portabello could not be identified. Presentations were lovely but the actual content - not so much. So one undercooked entree and one overcooked - very similar dishes. They also brought out the appetizer with the entrees.

Their food was at best average both times I went. Chicken alone should've signaled the end of the meal, but unfortunately more was already ordered. Granted, the atmosphere was lively, but service was off. Way off. The waiter disappeared for long stretches of time. He did not pay particular attention to what was asked and was only minimally familiar with the menu. However, every time he did materialize, he managed to disrupt a conversation. Overall, it was a ""C"" experience. Not terrible, but surely no point to come back for food.

We rolled into Feast at noon (on a Sunday), were warmly greeted and told the wait would be about 20 minutes--turned out to be more like five. Loved the decor and ambience. Service was great--prompt, friendly, attentive. Very well timed--I never felt neglected or rushed. I ordered their pancakes of the day (today it was pumpkin raisin)--and they were heavenly.

It was nice to be at a restaurant where tables were nicely spaced instead of sitting at tables placed so close to each other that the strangers at the table next to you can dive into your conversation. Feast had a good wine and beer list. I enjoyed the three types of wine flights ($9.50) listed that catered to different taste buds. The pomegranate punch cocktail ($9.00) was delicious. Also the description of each entree made it so hard to pick a dish. I was torn between a Chicken breast dish stuffed with goat cheese and the Lamb special. I asked our waiter for a recommendation and I appreciated that he was honest with me, instead of telling me that ""everything is good."" He recommended the Chicken Breast with goast cheese ($18) as a newcomer, and boy, I was very happy and satisfied with my meal. I enjoyed the presentation of the dish. I was definitely feasting with my eyes. The chicken was placed elegantly on top of potato gnocchi, spinach, and grape tomatoes, and the dish was finished with a nice rosemary twig on top. Also the lemon beurre blanc sauce that was drizzled on top was delicious. My friend ordered the braised beef short ribs ($20) that came with swiss chard + garlic mashed potatoes on the side.

I LOVE their menu, which would be getting a 4. But as many of you may know, service and attentiveness is key in the F&B industry....so, hence my dismay at the final verdict. I called one morning to see if there were any brunch reservation times available, which is hard to get as they're always busy around brunch. I was told they did and consequently put our name down. Unfortunately, we couldn't be sat until the whole group was there, which is normal. A couple in our group was late...but when they finally showed, I made sure to tell the hostess. The hostess told us we'd still need to wait a few minutes while the table cleared off. Soon, a table cleared and was being cleaned off, but the hostess jumped on the phone. In the time of her conversation, another group of our size walked in and up to the hostess podium. A guy came over to greet them and gave them OUR TABLE!!! And instead of asking the person on the phone to wait and CORRECTING her coworker, the hostess just shrugged at us.  I mean, I've worked in F&B during college, so I feel the right to say...what in THE heck!? After waiting for our group to be ""complete,"" I had to wait to be sat when another group just waltzed in? If you can't multitask while on the phone via physical cues to your coworkers, there's something wrong here.  Now, let's commence this review on what I love about Feast... Feast is in the perfect place to be accessibly by public transit or by car. The blue line stop (Damen) is just a block south, and you could take the North, Damen or Milwaukee bus, too.  The place is really cute, and they have a great outdoor patio for the Spring/Summer months. The tables don't feel on top of each other like some other restaurants. There is seating at the bar, and you can pull up to watch the game while having drinks and food. The restaurant seating is nice, but I would recommend a reservation if you can get one or else the wait can be long! My favorite time to go to Feast is for a weekend brunch, because they have a pancake special that is usually creative and big enough to split between a couple people. Their dinner menu is good, and they have a great tortilla soup. I've tried their burger, chicken and salads...can't go wrong with any of them.

The server was attentive, kept our wine glasses full, and was very polite. Me: Maple glazed pork chop with bacon-y brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. Him: Burger with cheddar and sweet potato fries. My chop was perfectly cooked and had just enough fat on it to keep it super juicy. The grainy mustard sauce was great with everything and there was a pound of bacon with my sprouts. I also ate a bunch of his fries-- it was a monstrous pile.

I've been to this restaurant twice in the last two weeks, had two different servers but somehow still managed to leave frustrated because of a deplorable waitstaff.  This past Sunday was more or less a joke. The woman who waited on us was both barely audible and extremely inattentive. We saw her three times in an hour. Once to get our order. Once to check up on us and then once to give us the bill. It was 84 and sunny on the patio. Some water would have been awesome! Instead, we withered.  We probably would have stayed and had a pitcher of something but since we could barely get the attention of our server we took our Sunday Funday elsewhere.  The previous weekend was barely different. Again, half-empty restaurant, terrible service. He was better than the mute who waited on us this Sunday, but only because we could actually hear what the hell h ewas saying.  Also, Feast servers, is it too much to ask for a smile? Are you forced to wear shoes with spikes in them? Are you beaten with a cat'o nine tails when you go back to the kitchen? Then why the hell do I feel like I am imposing on your day? If you want a decent brunch but service that is just slightly above a self-service cafeteria, then you should come here.

My husband tried it, made a face, and said ""What was this supposed to be?"" Yeah, you really couldn't tell it was supposed to be cream of potato and leek. Instead, you got salty greasy something... blech. The rest of our food was similarly lackluster. My tuna melt was blah (though the accompanying sweet potato fries were ok). My husband had the spicy chicken burrito which was neither spicy nor tasty. Also, the feast potatoes? Um, those puppies should have come out of the deep fryer about 5 minutes before they actually did. I mean I like crunchy potatoes, but when you fry them into oblivion, they lose all flavor and the ""crisp"" turns into ""charred bits"". They were bad (and it's hard to mess up a potato, or so I thought).

2011-04-25,2.0,"I wanted to like this place.  I love the name Feast for a restaurant and I loved the space.  We got there early for our reservation and were seated right away.  Then it just got bad.  We were there for Easter brunch.  It was a $27.50 prix fixe the included a basket of pastries, a choice of beverage and a choice of entree.  I had done some looking around online and had kind of decided on a couple things that sounded good (spring vegetable fritata, croque monsieur) so I was getting excited.  And then I did some comparing to the regular breakfast menu... Their entrees were listed at between $6 and $22, so I felt like a $27.50 prix fixe should have included some ROCKIN' pastries to make up for it being so expensive. Anyway, we sat down and right away our waiter asked what we wanted to drink.  We asked what juices they had and he listed them off and asked us again what we wanted.  I then asked for a minute to decide and look over our options... 10 minutes later, the waiter came back and took our drink orders.  I gave them to him while Joe was in the bathroom and asked about the  spring vegetable fritata and the croque monsieur since they were not on the menus given to us.  He said that he'd check on that.  Then he came back and asked if I looked at the right menu (I did) and said that those items were on the menu last year.  So I asked if someone just put the wrong menu up and he said ""I guess so.""  So, there's that.  A few more minutes later he came back and asked for our food order.  THEN our big glasses of room temp juice came out.  Then we asked if the pastry basket was supposed to come out as an appetizer or a dessert.  He said he could get one to us.  Then our food came out.  Then a ""basket"" of: one hot cross bun, one apricot pastry, and one tiny chocolate croissant.   My breakfast burrito was palatable.  It had everything in it that the menu said it would have, although I would've liked for it to have chorizo or bacon or something in it.  It came with a drizzle of red sauce on top of it, except this red sauce didn't taste like anything.  Joe's crab cakes were burnt.  That being said, they're lucky that he ordered them.  I would have sent them back.  But, he said the eggs were cooked well.  The highlight of the meal was the potatoes.  Cooked perfectly and tossed in what looked like kosher salt.  Delicious.  Throughout our meal, we had the pastries.  THEY WERE ALL COLD!!  Cold like they had come fresh out of the refrigerator.  And they weren't good.  They were all pretty tough.   Our waiter really did try though, and we eat out enough to know that the things that go wrong at a restaurant rarely have to do with the server/waiter.  He even gave us a la cart menu prices since we weren't able to get what we had wanted.  This resulted in our bill being about $33 instead of $55!  But, Joe mentioned that he thought there were some communication problems going on with front of house and back of house, as we saw a lot of plates full of food get taken away from tables around us (were we lucky that we got the right food?).  Also, while looking around us, we noticed that we were totally jipped in the pastry basket department.  Yeah, I understand we were a table of two, but the table of three next to us had a basket (we had a flower pot with a napkin stuffed into it) with scones, muffins, pastries, and hot cross buns.  Joe saw it and got upset (bless his heart) because that table of three had four times as many pastries as we did.  We're not even greedy, but whatever.  Then, there's the bathroom.  They must have been getting some work done in the building, but the women's restroom was through some doors and unmarked.  It looked like a large piece of plywood with a metal handle on it.  I don't know if the majority of people would see this and think ""women's restroom!"" or if maybe it was just me that felt like I might be walking into a janitor's closet... It was freezing and really run down looking.  Being in this neighborhood and being such a cute little restaurant, I expected a bathroom that was clean(er) and cuter.  The hand dryer wasn't working, so there was a stack of paper towels on the sink... That's fine.  The second time I went to the bathroom, before we left, there were no paper towels... Well, there were some, but they were wet.  from being on the sink.   So disappointed that we won't be back for a second chance.  Sorry, Feast.",0.9891,0.888,0.084,0.028,0.4707893153545325

I have visited both the Gold Coast and Wicker Park outlets of this place, and I have come away each time with the same question: How is this place still in business? Unfortunately, I went to Feast on a Friday night with two other couples for a group date night. Feast offers a gluten-free menu, which one of our friends needs, so it won out as the place for dinner.  My fiancee and I split the chips and gauc, which is the only reason I am giving Feast two stars at all. The were pretty terrific and the chips they fry up fresh were great. And, that my friends, is when where the positive stops. Despite knowing our friend had a gluten allergy and was ordering off the gluten free menu, her beet salad cam with a big battered and fried goat cheese fritter. Great. So, while the rest of us ate our apps, she had to wait for her salad to be remade, which took 10 minutes. Apparently, putting lettuce and beets on a plate takes that long.  I order the panko-crusted chicken for dinner, which looked nice, but tasted awful. It would have been helpful if the chicken had not been burnt on one side (of course the side not facing up). It's just plain shady - if you burn the chicken, remake it and don't serve it to me. The hubby's meatballs and rigatoni were equally bland.

2011-03-06,1.0,"Horrible management of a restaurant in a competitive neighborhood. My wife and I have eaten here maybe 3 times and yesterday we had to select a restaurant where we could go after a 7PM PBR event at the United Center, which meant finding a place that serves dinner at least until 11PM. I worked in a restaurant for nearly a decade and don't go to restaurants 5 minutes before they close and order dinner as a matter of principle, so there had to be 30 minutes of cushion, at least. Of the literally dozens, maybe hundreds of restaurants we had to choose from, between the several neighborhoods we were open to visiting, we chose Feast because we'd been and always found the food quite good and the atmosphere pleasant enough, with good service from the wait staff. I called to get a reservation and explained the situation and wanted a 10:15 - 10:30 reservation, not sure exactly when the show at the UC would be ending, etc. The woman to whom I spoke put us down for 10:15 and asked that I call if it would be a bit later, to which I agreed. By around 9:15 - 9:30, I was so looking forward to dinner and at around 9:40 the show ends and it seems we will make the 10:15 reservation easily. Then we get outside and have to walk about a mile and a half and can't find a cab or even a bus. At around 10PM I call ahead to Feast just to say it may be closer to 10:30 by the time we get there, but don't anticipate a problem since they serve until 11PM and their dinner rush must be over, etc. The hostess thanks me for calling and there is no problem. About 3 minutes or so later, I get a call from Feast and am told they are closing early, at 10:30 and it doesn't look like we will get there much before that, as we still have not seen a cab at this point. I was furious. Here, I was so looking forward to coming into their restaurant, certain we would have a good meal and a good time and they decide to close early? They post their hours as being open until 11PM on Friday and Saturday and, knowing we are coming in, tell me they have decided to close early. When I call back to express my extreme disappointment I am told ""Well, your reservation was for 10:15"" (turns out we actually could've made it there by 10:20 or 10:25, as we hailed a cab right after I called them).  I couldn't believe it. I should be able to just walk in w/o a reservation any time before 11PM and order dinner if their posted hours are 5PM to 11PM. As much as I liked Feast up until last night, I have no intention of ever setting foot in that restaurant again. If you are thinking about having dinner there, bear in mind they may just arbitrarily decide to close early that night and you may find yourself scrambling to find another suitable place at the last minute on a Saturday night. Luckily, there are a lot of restaurants in the neighborhood, so when you get there five or ten minutes late for your reservation and they've stopped serving, there are probably other places nearby who actually understand the purpose of actually posting hours of operation and even honor them.",0.9674,0.875,0.084,0.041,0.4080055210489994

Those were unique. I wouldn't say they are my favorite, but if you like chipotle this would be right up your alley. A friend we were with said her screwdriver was the best she's ever had and that's probably because they use freshly squeezed orange juice.  I had the eggs benedict. They were good. My only comment is that it was one piece of ham spread over both muffins. Trivial, I realize, but I do like the equal distribution of ham to muffin and this didn't have it. The potatoes were quite tasty. The omelets were okay according to those at the table that had them. It sounded like the hit of the crowd was the mac and cheese and I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to try some. Personally, I would say the best part of the meal were the potatoes.

I tried the breakfast croissant which was delicious, though I can't say I love the potatoes as much as other yelpers seem to have. The only thing that keeps this place from being a solid four stars for me is the indifferent service.

Sadly, it was a bit chilly for us to take advantage of the lovely patio, but the inside was just fine. The menu is varied, so you're likely to find something to feed your beast in your belly. For us? Burgers! Mom chose the regular burger (topped with bacon and cheese) and I went with the turkey burger (swiss cheese, onions and honey mustard.) Both were excellent. Her burger was cooked to her specification and deliciously juicy. My turkey burger was well-seasoned...the onions, cheese and honey mustard complimented the burger well. Regular fries for her and sweet potato fries for me. Our bellies were full and very happy. My one gripe is the service. While our server was pleasant, we had to wait close to a minute at the host stand while two employees ignored us before they chose to sat us. Likewise, when we left, those same two employees completely ignored us on our departure. I really feel like that is unacceptable, especially when I am paying $12 for a burger.

When we arrived, we still waited for more than 20 minutes after our reservation time. Not swell.  While we waited, we headed to the bar for some cocktails. For those considering doing the same, know that they charge extra for drinks on the rocks that are typically served on the rocks. Ice is $1? Are those maraschino cherries soaked in gold juice? No? Hmmm. Be warned.  The plus is they have a cute, covered patio.  The food was good, but nothing to do backflips over. It was a ""it'll do alright"" kind of meal. Note that the cost of an alright kind of meal is more aligned with an amazing, most excellent meal. Choose wisely.  I may come back and give it a second chance. Maybe brunch is better.

2010-07-13,1.0,"I was extremely disappointed in my recent trip to Feast.  I am gluten-intolerant and specifically chose Feast as a brunch destination because their website showed a fairly extensive gluten-free menu. I requested the gluten-free menu when I arrived and the host brought it over, but promptly pointed out that nearly half of the items on it are no longer offered.  Furthermore, although the website showed numerous brunch options, this menu did not include any. I asked our server about gluten-free brunch options and she was completely clueless.  Now, I don't expect everyone to be familiar with this, but when a restaurant specifically advertises having a gluten-free menu on their website, I don't think it's too much to ask that the servers be knowledgeable about what gluten-intolerance is. I recalled that the chilaquiles were listed on the website as being gluten-free, but luckily asked the server to check with the kitchen about whether the corn tortilla chips were cooked together with the flour ones.  She confirmed they were, which means they are reailly not gluten-free and should not be included on their menu. I ended up ordering an omelette, which would've come with potatoes but after questioning, the server confirmed for me that they weren't gluten-free.  She offered to substitute fruit instead, which I gladly accepted.  The omelette ended up being fine, but the server charged me $2.50 extra for the fruit, which I just don't feel is right (or at the very least she should've warned me it would be extra). After leaving, I emailed the restaurant to complain very nicely, but got no response. I don't expect all restaurants to be knowledgeable or overly accomodating for gluten-intolerance, but this experience was disappointing simply because I felt like Feast gave the false impression that they would be accomodating.",-0.2952,0.847,0.071,0.082,0.5402947845804988

The potatoes that come with everything were a little too ""fried"" tasting for my taste (I think they're actually roasted, not sure), but my boyfriend and brother really liked them.  Dinner - hot dates are awesome and were surprisingly filling. Mac & cheese are really good, especially for leftovers, if there any left. Also very filling, so be careful with getting appetizers. Chicken chopped salad was great with a ton of white meat chicken and veggies; very fresh. My boyfriend ordered salmon before, which he really enjoyed and chicken breast with herbed goat cheese was also delish.   Oh yeah, and last time we ordered desert, which is not on the delivery menu - you have to ask, and it was also very good.

Mine was a little icy, but still tasty; he described his ""like a mango kicked me right in the mouth,"" but said it was also sweet. There were other options mixed with yoghurt or other fruits as well.  When it came to the meal, I veered toward breakfast and he opted toward lunch. I chose the ""oatmeal pancakes with cinnamon-apple compote, honey-vanilla butter and walnut brittle,"" which were hearty (oats!) yet not too hardcore; the burliness of the pancakes made them stand up to the butter, which was eating through one part of the pancakes -- had they been prim foamy pancakes they apparently would have been lost to this consuming (yet yummy) concoction. As to the other components, the cinnamon apples could have been warmer, and the ""walnut brittle"" was like candied walnuts (individually coated nuts, don't think shards like peanut brittle). Overall, a pretty successful dish, and very filling. The young man opted for the steak tortilla salad, which he really enjoyed: the avocado, cilantro dressing and marinated steak all played nicely together.

Lunch is also very good here - a more traditional and somewhat limited menu, but still good.  Totally diggin on the tortilla soup but the black bean burger lacked flavor the last time I had it. They lose two stars because dinner is boring and expensive when compared to brunch.  I like the butternut squash ravioli and their cocktails are AMAZING but I always leave feeling that dinner should have been a bit better because the brunch is just sooo good.

Ok, next time, I'll order the eggs portabella.  My favorite part was the bloody mary though.

Here's what happened: my waiter said he was too busy to sort out the bill from the 6 of is that he added a 20% gratuity to - without any prior warning. I know how that works, I've also been a waiter, so I can understand being busy on a Saturday night (when we went). Really though? We can't just write which bill has what items and you just send us one for each? We even offered to pay your 20% gratuity, jackass.

The bruschetta appetizer is quite a bit small, but has an awesome mix of olives that I haven't tasted elsewhere - it's different from the trader joes diced olive mix.

I chose the calamari and the chopped salad and found my expectations exceeded in both cases.  The calamari was perfectly cooked, and the artichoke/lemon tapenade and red pepper aioli were wonderful accents.  After the squid was gone I basically cleaned the plate with the table bread. My salad was delightful.  It was really nothing more than a collection of fresh vegetables (it had chicken but no cheese or bacon, which was a-okay with me) but somehow it just blew me away.  It was so damn good.  We're talking green beans, chickpeas, radishes, broccoli, red and yellow bell peppers, carrots, red onions, corn, and cherry tomatoes.  It needed only the barest touch of dressing, although that stuff was pretty darn good too.  It seems odd to wax rhapsodic about a salad, but this was a great one.

2010-02-02,5.0,"Feast is my newest favorite.  I find myself leaning towards it as my suggestion whenever a meal comes up, no matter what the circumstance.  Family in from the burbs...yes.  Date Night...yes.  Guest in from out of town...yes.  Ladies Night...yes.  I had been here a couple times a few years ago but never really allowed myself to put in my bank of possibilities since Bucktown seemed like it was just as close as Seattle.  However, now I realize just how easy it is for me to get here and now all bets are off.  Feast should expect a lot more of my money flowing in.  A few of my favorites I've tried:  - Rigatoni with meatballs, peas, and tomato cream sauce - Flank steak with grilled asparagus, goat cheese mashed potato (one of the best steaks I've had in a long time, melted in my mouth) - The little biscuits basket they give you with spicy /smokey butter - Veggie Burger with the sweet potato fries - Butternut squash ravioli, spiced walnuts, crispy sage leaves, brown butter + goat cheese with balsamic syrup  - Chicken breast stuffed with herbed goat cheese,  ricotta gnocchi, spinach, cherry tomatoes, lemon sauce - Chocolate brownie sundae - Sticky toffee pudding cake - Peanut butter and jelly pie (good lord!!!)

I had the portabello benedict with a fried portabello and sun-dried tomatos topped with a delicious poached eggs and hollandaise sauce... Mmmmm. The feast potatoes were alright - just normal potatoes. There are a few other benedicts, which seem to be the specialty here but not a huge menu. If you can't decide, there's a benedict sampler too. The Bucktown bloody mary was also excellent - nice and spicy, just enough to relieve my hangover.  The restaurant itself was much different than I expected from the outside. It ended up being much bigger and more contemporary than I anticipated. It was a cute setup.

2010-02-01,4.0,"Had dinner here after work with a friend on their half-price wine night.  Overall, I'd say the atmosphere is fine, nothing too special and nice and mellow on a week night. The service was good, but not great and the omni-present busboy seemed to really freak out my friend with his hovering and eagerness.  The food was fantastic. We had a bottle of Syrah reco'd by the server and were not disappointed.  We stared with the mac and cheese which is about as decadent as you'd think. Big chunks of pancetta added a salty smokiness to the dish that only made it more rich and delicious. Definitely share this appetizer and get the small version unless you are a true glutton for cheesy punishment.  I followed up with the fish tacos which were the best I've ever had. The perfect mix of spicy and citrusy without drowning the flavor of the fish. The beans were also incredibly tasty and the whole meal was very filling.  My friend ordered the pork chop which was accompanied by the biggest sweet potato gratin either of us had ever seen. It was good from the bit I tasted, but I was happier with my tacos.  I really enjoyed Feast and plan on heading back, though their prices will keep me from becoming a regular. It's in that weird place that's too casual for special occasion dinners, but too pricey for just meeting up for a menu that is mighty tasty, but a bit above fancy bar food. I will be back, but maybe for lunch or brunch so it's a bit easier on my wallet.",0.9967,0.687,0.254,0.059,0.5824699110413397

I've probably gone here 30+ times in the last 2-3 years and I wish I went more often.  First off: Brunch. Their brunch options are amazing. The menu is not huge, but the dishes are well thought out and the flavors are amazing. I've had many items off their breakfast menu, as well as some of their specialty pancakes and I've never had a complaint. My favorite for a solid, get you through til dinner brunch is their Feast Grand Slam. Yeah, it's just eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns and toast, but it's hearty and the Feast potatoes are the best around. Lunch: They have your standard salad and sandwich offerings. I don't think there's anything special about their lunch menu, but the food is good. Dinner: This is where they win me over again. I highly recommend starting with their tortilla soup. It's a huge portion and best eaten with a smaller entree or appetizer. Personally, I love the spicy crab cakes (omg, mouthwatering) and the won ton napoleon (literally like a sushi salad). The chicken breast and blackened fish taco entrees are always good bets. Essentially, no matter what you get to eat here you won't be disappointed. Pair the food with great customer service and a lively, but relaxed setting and you've got a great meal start to finish. By far, my #1 recommended restaurant in the area.",0.9986,0.638,0.331,0.031,0.5628571428571428

I had a Apple and Walnut salad, that would knock the lights out of the pathetic excuse of an apple walnut salad at mcdonalds.  Candied walnuts, triangle pieces of smoked gouda, crunchy and tart green apple, in a honey-thyme vinagerette.   My friend Jamie had the beef burger with cheddar and bacon, great burger and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries are divine, and a crispy and light treat.  Such a breath of fresh air from the run of the mill french fries. To top the wine, cheese, greens, and meat, we had to order desert, we got the lava cake, divine!  It was also served beautifully with a design of sun beams around our piece of lava cake.   All in all great meal.  We each paid $24.09 plus a tip of $5 each, so $30 each, for a great meal.  Totally worth it and I will go back, for brunch next time lets hope!",0.9944,0.748,0.237,0.015,0.4756410256410256
2010-01-24,4.0,"Just met up with a friend for brunch--our original plan was Hot Chocolate, but the 25 minute wait and loud atmosphere didn't fit our goal of a girl's catch up session. Feast turned out to be a great plan B. Our 15 minute wait seemed to fly by as we chatted away while sitting in the cozy, overstuffed red couches by the fireplace. Within moments of being seated at a great table by the window, our server came over to get our drink orders. My friend had a large fresh-squeezed OJ while I got my caffeine fix with a soy cafe au lait. I would consider myself a connoisseur of coffees and the coffee served at Feast (I think it's Intelligista) was on pointe-5 stars on the coffee. Our waiter was super patient as he came by our table multiple times to get our order, but my friend and I were busy chatting and took our time going through the menu. After our waiter clued us into the popularity of the benedict dishes, I decided on the portabella benedict, which has oven roasted tomatoes, spinach and poached egg atop a breaded portabella mushroom served with their potatoes. The dish was pretty good-the tomatoes were amazing, a bit sweet and a nice complement to the dish. The portabella had too much breading for my liking, so I didn't eat too much of it. I'm not a fan of hollandaise, so I can't comment on that. But, all in all, the dish was amazing. My friend did a build your own omelets, with which she seemed very happy. Her omelet had roasted tomatoes, which she also enjoyed. Once our plates were cleared, we were able to chat some more without being interrupted.  All in all, this is a great brunch spot, especially if you really want to indulge in long conversations and good food. I would definitely recommend the coffee drinks, benedicts, service and ambiance. I would definitely go back to try the oatmeal pancakes and some of the other benedicts. I'm only giving Feast four stars, but it would be 4.5 stars if Yelp had  1/2 points, since I would like to see more creative brunch items on their menu.",0.9988,0.734,0.255,0.012,0.6207010582010581

While trying to decide on what to eat, I could not help myself from passing up their Oatmeal Pancakes.  Picture it: Fluffy pancakes, cinnamon-apple compote, honey-vanilla butter and tossed walnut brittle.  Delectable!  My partner also had a Feast speciality, the Potato Skins.  It was merely potato skins (go figure.) breakfast-style with scrambled eggs, bacon bits and pico de gallo.  While both food items were yummy, it wasn't as superb as what people had made it up to be.  I agree with Molly's review, ""Pretty standard brunch menu...nothing terrible creative, but enough to get my there.""  Well said Molly! For those with special dietary restrictions like Celiac, Feast offers a separate Gluten-free menu and several vegetarian options.  Not to mention, Feast was one of my top choices for my pre-2010 New Years Eve dinner.  Word on the street is that Feast was going to be opening a new third location in Lincoln Square.  I'm not too sure if that is still the case but I would love to have it down the street.  Perhaps the owners changed their mind and opened the Gold Coast restaurant instead.",0.9736,0.813,0.142,0.045,0.5758075258075258
2010-01-07,4.0,"A very chill neighborhood restaurant with a solid menu of traditional American fare. They have a great special running right now where you get any entree plus an appetizer, soup, salad or dessert and a glass of wine for $25. For someone who can't put down more than two courses anyway, this is a really nice deal. I stopped by on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm with a group of six. No problem getting a table, because as you can imagine, we were practically the only people there. Things picked up around 7pm, and by the time we left at close to 8:30pm, every table was full. I didn't see a lot of people waiting, though, so unless you're coming on a weekend or with a group of more than four, reservations are not a necessity. Plus, they have a separate bar area with a fireplace and couches in one corner, so even if you do have to wait, it will be a semi-pleasant experience. I sampled the tomato soup, spicy crab cakes, margherita pizza and blackened fish tacos. The pizza was tasty, but nothing that special. Good crust, and perfect size for one person. The seafood was much better. The fish tacos had surprisingly bold flavors. I definitely wanted the whole plate to myself. Soup was the only low point. Too thick, almost like marinara sauce. And it was room temperature. I eyed up a friend's butternut squash ravioli, which looked rich and creamy and perfect for a winter evening. The veggie burger and steak also looked good, but I since I didn't know the owners of the dishes very well, I fought back my urge to ask for a bite. Portions were average. Our service got a bit spottier as the night went on, which is to be expected given that it was a full house by that time. We waited a few minutes longer than I would have liked to get the bill and pay. But they had a separate person filling waters so no wait on that. I don't recall an overly long wait for food, but it wasn't lightening quick, either, which is what I was expecting given that the place was dead when we ordered.  No problems finding parking on Damen, but again, we were in relatively early.

I'm gonna start with the bathroom (not sure if there was one for the men).  The hostess told me to go down the hall and through the green door.  On this journey I came across cooks, waiters, busboys. ..  ya know let's just say I pretty much felt like I should have been picking up a plate to serve to someone or whipping an up order.  WTH? Going to the bathroom here is like going to the bathroom at a grocery store. You feel like you're part of the staff rather than a customer. I was not amused.  I was here in a group for, yes, a birthday.  The waiter was cool, but I almost gave the busboy a little smack on the hand when it seemed he was reaching for my plate. I was only half done with my BBQ Chicken Quesadilla and a couple other people that arrived only a few minutes prior had orders coming. No, I do not want to wrap this as we are clearly not done dining! Fall back!!  Said antsy fingers busboy never refilled my water glass and snatched my b&b plate without asking if I was done with it. So when he went for my plate *while* asking me if I want it wrapped up I felt I had to protect my  food and my immediate space bubble as a whole.  I seriously don't like feeling rushed. Especially when we have more food on the way meaning we were continuously spending money.  Between this and the bathroom I was seriously irked. Then, they only had some icky flavored  butter or the bread instead of supplying plain as well. I'm so big on the butter a place serves. My quesadilla was decent for it to be an appetizer, but that's it.  Yea, I think this place is better named ""Snack"" as that's all the time they will give you to do and that's about as much as you'll want to have.",0.9627,0.843,0.106,0.05,0.5164257369614511

A full service bar in mid June with no mint. Okay. I finally settled for what turned out to be a weak gin and tonic. Had the black bean and jalapeño ravioli and was thoroughly underwhelmed. Lots of cream, butter and salt but nothing distinguishing.  Utterly bland. My dates barbecued salmon was equally bland. Smothered in what the menu boasted as Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Sweet Baby Rays is on par with Kraft in my book and not something I'd disclaim in the menu. The corn impregnated pancakes the fish was served over we decent. My side dish of spinach was forgotten and when arrived later it was inedible. Once again over-salted, more boiled than sautéd and tasted of rot honestly.

2009-06-21,5.0,"Feast is the bomb! So just to give you some background... My friends, boyfriend, and I were all arguing about where to eat our dinner on Friday night. I said "" no bar food, somewhere with class, on Damen, in Bucktown."" I said Takashi, they weren't thrilled with the prices or options. They said Salud, I wasn't feeling it. So my friend and I noticed Feast as our cab was racing down Damen and we screamed ""stop!"" to the driver, paid and jumped out. We were pleased to note that the vibe was right. Nice decor, not overly loud or crowded. We chose to sit inside because it was very hot but it had nice outdoor seating as well. They started us off with a bread basket that had good fresh bread and some corn muffins. Some kind of red pepper cheesy compound butter accompanied the basket. So good! My friend and I got martinis. I had the pomegranate punch and hers had a mixture of juices including cucumber juice. They were both very good. We started with the carmelized onion dip and homemade chips. Fabulous. The chips were fresh and had a slight vinegar taste. The dip had quite a bit of onion but it was really good ( and I don't even particularly like onion!)

This is the kind of place that I would recommend against, but if forced I could certainly find something to cure my appetite, but I'd rather just sit with a glass of wine and enjoy the atmosphere.",0.9907,0.663,0.283,0.053,0.7233082706766917

The steak was lacking flavour, the chimichurri was subpar and the mashed potatoes were not good.  My girlfriend had the tilapia tacos which I tried and thought they were a little too fishy for my taste. Tried the apple tart for dessert and was also underwhelmed. I really wanted to love this place as much as I did the first time I visited, but it really fell well below my expectations. The service was good until the dinner arrived and then our server sort of dissappeared. It took a while to to get the dessert and the check.

2009-05-09,3.0,"Last night, on one of the first truly warm May evenings, I was excited to try Feast and dine outside on their patio.  It had rained a little earlier in the evening, but part of the patio is covered, so I knew we'd be fine. Service was... an interesting dichotomy.  The server himself was incredibly overwhelmed (I wasn't the only one with the idea of enjoying dinner al fresco).  He didn't even make it over to our table to take drink orders until we'd been seated for quite a while.  He also did not seem very knowledgeable about the menu (the menu itself warrants its own paragraph, see below).  In contrast to his slow speed, the people bringing out the food were moving at lightning pace.  BAM!  They'd fly by and food would be dropped in front of you as they raced to another table. OK, the menu.  Apparently they have ""different versions""... understandable, but why weren't we given the one that was correct for that evening?  I was excited to try their Indian Vegetarian Plate only to learn that two of the main components had been swapped out for Thai and other pan-Asian cuisine.  I had the butternut squash ravioli (which was delicious) but was disappointed.  You can get butternut squash ravioli so many places, I'd really been hoping to try something new.  At least the Specials menu was correct - the strawberry creme brulee dessert was sublime. As for ambiance, there are certain things you expect when eating outside.  For one, the general commotion of the street (we saw three ambulances go by at different times during our meal - last night must have been a very dangerous night on Damen!).  However, one thing I didn't expect was the, uh, aroma.  Midway through dinner, we hear a huge crash.  Everyone stops and looks back to the source of the noise: someone had just thrown something enormous into the Dumpster in the alley behind Feast.  This stirred up all sorts of unpleasant smells.  My date pointed out that perhaps the person who made the Dumpster deposit wasn't affiliated with the restaurant, but perhaps the offending Dumpster itself could be repositioned?  I don't know.  But I do know that it is hard to eat with the smell of Dumpster wafting through the patio.",0.4331,0.838,0.084,0.077,0.5583570900644071

Apple Blueberry Crumble - Slight notes of sourness, crumble was good, fairly unsweet dessert for those who aren't looking for sweetness.  This ranked third in our group.  -$6 Chocolate Decandent - Pure unadulterated chocolate, soft, moist, delish.  Share this dish, as the chocolate was nearly overpowering.  Comes with a raspberry sauce (excellent, brings out the chocolate flavors well).  This ranked second for my fiancee and I.  -$6 Banana Creme Brulee - Perhaps I've never had banana creme brulee before, but this dish was the clear winner for my fiancee and I.  The creme brulee could've used a bit more of a ""crack"" to the sugar top, but the creme underneath with thin slices of banana mixed in was creamy, smooth, and delicious.  It was a welcome surprise! Verdict:  The dessert is worth going back for.  Not sure about meals yet, but if we're in the neighborhood, may stop back again to check it out.  My only issue (resulting in 3 stars instead of 4) was that the service was fairly lacking... for a group of 5 people to sit down with dessert menus, we really don't need 20 minutes of time before someone appears to take our order.",0.9853,0.834,0.149,0.017,0.5235690235690235

I have been here for brunch before but this review will only cover a weeknight dinner during the winter (read: no boisterous patio.)

A bottle of wine was half price (score.) We started with the seared scallops (they were made with chorizo, appples, frisee, corn and other stuff) and the flavor combos were really excellent. I'm not a huge fan of chorizo but it was the perfect thing to make the scallops more savory. We also really enjoyed the little tiny corn bread muffins and roasted pepper butter that they put out on the table.  We ordered one of the specials, a sirloin round dish with scalloped potatoes and green beans. It was excellent. Somehow the wonderful wine we were drinking didn't do much for it, but the meat itself and the red wine reduction was to die for. It came out more rare than we ordered it (no complaints there) and it had a delicious salty rub that formed a crust that was really good. We also ordered one other appetizer, the Wonton Neapolitan (I think that's what it was called) and it was really, really good. It was basically a decomposed sushi tower with tuna sashimi, tuna tartar, seaweed salad, ginger, green, smoked salmon, greens all seperated by friend wonton sheets and a wasabi cream sauce around the dish. It was delicious, fun to eat and was made even better by the Cab/Merlot we were drinking. All in all, this I think this is what Chicago is all about.

Over the course of a week I ate cheeseless omelets at Earwax, Toast, Silver Cloud, and Feast. This was my third time dining at Feast, and their omelet finally drove me to write a review. The first time I went to Feast, it was for dinner on Christmas Eve 2004. The restaurant was nearly empty. The food was great, the service was great, the setting was cozy. The next time I went to Feast, it was for brunch in the summertime.  My friend and I had to wait forever for a table, then we had to wait forever for our server, then they ran out of the item I ordered after I ordered it, then they ran out of the replacement item after I ordered THAT.  I vowed I wasn't coming back to Feast again after that, but a few years passed. Last weekend was a familiar scenario: we got seated, then waited a long time for our server, who apologized for the wait but then took forever to come back with our drinks.  Service was slow and unapologetic from that point on.  I ordered a ham, onion, and mushroom omelet; my boyfriend ordered a feta, spinach, and tomato omelet. I was disappointed to discover that instead of blending all these ingredients together with the eggs, they created a pancake shape out of the fried eggs, and then folded it over and placed the ingredients inside. Kind of like an omelet taco.  But who wants to eat a piece of fried egg with a bunch of chopped up ham, mushrooms, and onions  sitting next to it? WTF? My boyfriend's omelet had the feta to hold it together a little better, but mine was so gross I didn't finish it. Sorry Feast.

2008-12-20,4.0,"The food here definitely saved the night. We had a group of 12 with dinner reservations at 7:30 for my friend's birthday.  Because of the snowy weather some of us were a little tardy, but they held the table for us and sat us right away with no problem. We had a long table in the back corner of the restaurant.  It was a little cozy, but good.  The lights were dimmed just as we sat down, and with the candles on the table it really set the tone for a nice romantic evening.  Except I was dining with 11 other people... so maybe not THAT romantic. My one complaint about this place (other than the maze to the bathroom) is that I don't think our server was on top of things at the beginning.  We were seated at about 7:50, and after ordering drinks and apps, he did not come to take our entree orders until nearly an hour later, long after we were onto bottles of wine/round of drinks number two and finished with the apps.  It struck me as odd, and I'll admit I was annoyed because many of us were starving and filling up on the bread, which you never want to do.  Good thing the bread was yummy.  (And that butter - it's very sneaky!  Sweet at first, then a minute later it's WOW, hello SPICY aftertaste!) Even though it took forever to place our order for our entrees, they came out fairly quickly.  Out of 12 people, only one order was screwed up (her filet was cooked too much, she sent it back and was promptly served with a good one).  I think my steak was a little undercooked than what I requested, but it was still good so I didn't send it back. I had the skirt steak, and it was DIVINE.  Seriously, I think I'm already dreaming about it.  The presentation was nice too.  It came with a small helping of potatoes and some sauce that was delish.  There was some green stuff on the plate as well that was super spicy, so I didn't make that mistake twice. Everyone at the table truly enjoyed their food.  That's hard to do with a group that large - someone is bound to be unhappy, but that was not the case.  I think nearly everyone at the table ordered something different, so some of us sampled each other's dishes, and everyone was pleased.  The birthday girl got the salmon which came on a stack of pancakes with corn - um, yeah, they were freaking awesome. After we all ate, I think everyone was in a food coma...  But then the server (who seemed to be with it during the second part of our meal), brought out creme brule for the birthday girl.  I did not partake, but everyone who sampled it seemed to be in heaven. Would I come back here?  Yes, absolutely.  Perhaps not with such a big group next time, but I truly enjoyed my meal here, despite a rocky beginning with the server.  The rest of the staff was totally on top of everything as well.

The service is quicker and there are often open spots.  The boyfriend and I went to for brunch at about 9:30am on a Sunday.  We requested a table indoors, as it is October and a little chilly. It was crowded, but we were told that it would not be long. After about 10-15 minutes the hostess called our names, but when we walked over she seemed confused and told us ""nevermind.""  She said it would be another 10-15 minutes for something inside, but reminded us that there was immediate seating available outside. We were hungry and anxious so we settled. This was irritating, but not a big deal. We were lead to a small leaning table (which became an issue later when the ketchup bottle slid off the table and broke all over) that was squeezed tightly between two others. I ordered the chilaquiles with a side of feast potatoes and the boyfriend ordered a custom omelette and a bagel. I was tempted to order the special granola pancakes with cinnamon butter, but hopefully that will be available another time. Our food took about 15-20 minutes, which doesn't sound like a long time, but felt like forever - maybe just because we were sitting outside and a feeling a little cold. I would suggest that they add portable heaters if they are going to continue seating people outside as we get into the colder weather. This would have made our experience more comfortable. The waiter was attentive and polite.  I LOVED the chilaquiles. They were fantastic. The chorizo, cheese, and pico de gallo were perfectly proportioned over the corn tortillas. I would have liked beans and rice, as I have usually seen accompanying most chilaquile breakfasts. The feast potatoes were good, nice and crispy like I like. My boyfriend said his omelette was just ok. There wasn't enough meat and he said it was lacking in flavor. It was also difficult to eat because it was not fully closed.

Promising news is that as we were leaving a younger crowd of couples and groups of girlfriends were trickling in, so it's probably a little better crowd after 8pm. Ate the goat cheese stuffed chicken dish which was excellent. It needed salt, but everything I eat needs salt, so I'm not sure how objective that is.  Next time, I'll order the buttery lemon sauce on the side so that it doesn't feel like my healthy spinach and cherry tomatoes are swimming in a sea of guilt. Price was a bit steep - the menu may be a little too big for it's britches - but not too bad as long as you're not treating a party of 6. Agree with other posters on the bathroom - it was somewhat of a maze to find. But that's certainly not a deal breaker. After all, who wants the toilet in the dining room, anyway? The service was just eh - server could have checked back a little more often and showed a little more enthusiasm / interest / desire to earn the tip. Our guy seemed very in-touch with his emotions. Or maybe just preoccupied with deep philosophical thoughts. Depending on what you like, you can take that for what it's worth.",0.9913,0.768,0.181,0.052,0.4153628117913832

C'mon when I am done with my food, flag you down to get my check so I can enjoy the rest of the day - don't wait twenty minutes to bring it !!!

2008-06-25,3.0,"Believe the hype! The service sucks! Eddie Murphy tells this joke in Coming to America: A man goes into a restaurant and orders a bowl of soup. The soup comes out and he says to the waiter, Waiter come taste the soup. Waiter says: Is something wrong with the soup? He says: Taste the soup. Waiter says: Is there something wrong with the soup? Is the soup too hot? He says: Will you taste the soup? What's wrong, is the soup too cold? Will you just taste the soup?! All right, I'll taste the soup -- where's the spoon? Man: Aha! Five out of six of us had that experience last night at Feast. We all ordered appetizers. When we had finished our appetizers, the busser cleared the table. Completely. Including all utensils and bread plates. (More on that in a minute.) Some time later, our entrees came out. And by ""some time later,"" I mean not immediately. Probably at least 10 minutes. By which time we had not received new utensils. This is when the guy next to me told the joke from Coming to America. And explained where it was from. After which, we still had no utensils. When the joke becomes reality, that's a problem. Eventually, one of out party flagged down another server -- or maybe a host -- to bring us out new utensils. Because in all this time, our server had not reappeared. This, in and of itself, is not a deal breaker. Someone at the table made a distinction between the kind of service you can expect from an upscale vs. a downscale restaurant. Granted. But first, Feast is casual, but not downscale. Second, bringing you something to eat your dinner with is something I expect from the meanest of diners. This is basic. And when the busser cleared, he took salad plates, a mussel bowl, and two mac n' cheese bowls. All of which were clearly appetizer plates. Earlier, I mentioned that the busser took our bread plates. I didn't even realize that's what they were, because we never received any bread. It wasn't until someone at our table mentioned it that I looked around and saw the cute bread baskets on every other table. Monday and Tuesday, Feast sells half-priced bottles of wine. We ordered a bottle of white and a bottle of red. The server initially brought out five glasses (for a party of six), because one of our party wasn't drinking white wine. Later, that diner ordered a bottle of red, but the server neglected to bring him a glass. When he did bring a glass, he didn't bother to ask any of the rest of us if we wanted fresh glasses for our red wine. I'm not above drinking red wine out of a glass I just used for white wine, but it shouldn't be expected. At the end of the meal, a couple of our party ordered coffee. ""All right, I'll taste the soup -- where's the spoon? Man: Aha!"" No cream and sugar was brought, or even offered. Once again, we had to flag someone down to fulfill what should have been a natural part of service. Our server was *clearly* not new. If he was, I *might* have been able to excuse some of these errors. And the restaurant was not that busy. While the patio was pretty full, the inside was empty. And a party of six has the potential of ringing up a tab two to three times that of a smaller table -- give them a little attention. I'm still giving Feast three stars, because it has a lot going for it. The outside patio is large and comfortable (although the chairs, if you are a person of some girth, are not), and the food was all good. Every other table got bread, so the poor service is apparently not complete.

2008-01-17,3.0,"3.5 Stars.          My boyfriend and I went to Feast for the first time last night. It looks really inviting from the outside, so we thought we would finally give it a try. There was a wine tasting going on when we arrived (at 7:00 PM) and a nice crowd had assembled to drink and nosh. While we were seated in the main dining room, the atmosphere of the bar was really pleasant. I definitely would go back on a cold winter night, grab a seat by the fireplace and warm up with some wine. How picturesque!     The decor in the intimate main dining room was also aesthetically pleasing. Brighter than the bar area, beautiful lamps hang from the ceiling. My boyfriend thought they looked retro, but what does he know? The dining room felt surprisingly small--and only about half the tables were full. I imagine that on a busy night it might feel a bit cramped, but I guess that's true of a lot of restaurants.     I started off dinner with a glass of the Riesling and my boyfriend had a Fat Tire (which they had on tap, along with a Goose Island Harvest Ale and some kind of Rogue Ale). I thought the Riesling was good, but not anything special. For an appetizer we ordered the portebello quesadilla, which was more than enough for two people to share. I usually don't like quesadillas, but this one was pretty tasty. Although, I don't think I would order it again. Next time, I want to try the mussels. Yum. For dinner, I had the skirt steak ($19) and my boyfriend had the stuffed chicken with gnocchi ($18). My steak was really good! It was everything a steak should be--juicy, moist, and tasty. It also came with really good mashed potatoes and some delicate onion rings. The chicken was good, but the gnocchi's consistency and texture was just a bit off. They were denser than I usually like them and almost crunchy on the outside, as if they had been lightly fried or toasted. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not, but either way they tasted a bit strange.  But, it wasn't enough to stop my boyfriend from finishing off his meal and mine! The food was plated nicely and all around it was an enjoyable dinner.   I do, however, have three criticisms. Firstly, the service wasn't superb. While it wasn't by any means bad, our waiter was a bit scarce. I would guess that on busier nights the service would be even slower. Secondly, some of the dishes were slightly pricey. While I thought that my skirt steak was fairly priced, my boyfriend's chicken dish seemed expensive for what it was. Thirdly, and this is purely opinion, I thought a lot of the descriptions on the menu sounded really unappetizing! I'm not a picky eater at all and usually I can find numerous things I want to order at any restaurant, but not many items on Feast's menu grabbed my attention. A lot of them just seemed . . . off.   Complaints aside, I'm sure I'll end up back at Feast one of these days. It definitely warrants a second tasting and it is just so damn close! For those who have to drive there, they have valet parking for 10 bucks. If you are going on a weeknight, don't bother with it! Look for parking on the near by side streets instead!",0.9783,0.829,0.112,0.059,0.5397721454173067

2007-12-21,4.0,"And FEAST we did! Mm. On a whim, I made a reservation on Wednesday night for dinner with a friend. I've blasted past the exterior on the Damen bus more times than I can count, and I'd heard only good things. Inside, there was a monthly wine tasting going on around the bar. The whole area was gorgeous, with a roaring fire in one corner and a nice standing bar that meandered around the whole room. Really great for conversation, it looked like. Apparently, on the third Wednesday of every month, you pay $20 to get in on it, and you sample and snack to your heart's content. But we went for the big guns and were seated in the equally cozy dining room, which was lit by huge, colorful lanterns. Beautiful ambiance. Our server was blas to the point of hilarity: When we asked him about the pot pie (which was listed as ""market price""), he said, ""It's a chicken pot pie with peas, onions and cream. It's $14."" In the best Ben Stein voice I've heard out of a twentysomething, ever. My friend, who is gay and absolutely wonderful, said our server was the kind of guy he just wanted to take to get a haircut. I had to agree. Sam got the steak salad, and I got a lovely glass of Carmenere/Cabernet, a small house salad with INCREDIBLE  balsamic vinaigrette and the macaroni and cheese appetizer. Now, I am a blue-box-blues aficionado, and I normally prefer the box variety to what I get in restaurants (I'm gross, I know). But this mac and cheese was approaching orgasmic, truly. The pasta was done perfectly; the cheese was a creamy parmesan with a little something else for smooth meltiness; and the pancetta, roasted tomatoes, some delicious little green things and crunchy bread crumbs on top... Just perfection. And I don't say that very often. We split the apple-blueberry tart for dessert, which was a little ho-hum and could've used some cinnamon or ANY other spice.

2007-04-24,4.0,"I went to Feast for the first time last night since I had a coupon from that quarterly coupon book that magically appears in my mailbox. I ended up not using said coupon since my party was feeling wine-y and it was half price wine night and you can only use one deal at a time. We picked a wine out and were brought the wrong bottle. It tasted delicious and was the same price, so I'm not complaining, but I likely would have had it been priced much higher than the wine we had picked.  I have mixed feelings about our experience at Feast. The food is amazing and this is a new favorite, for sure, however my problem was with our watiress. The service started out great, but took a nose dive. When we sat down, our waitress seemed sweet but a bit of a space cadet. I guess some servers don't like to give their opinions as to what they think about a menu item, but when I asked for her opinion on two items, she really didn't know what to say. I ended up going with the beet salad which was WONDERFUL. Recently I've really been digging beets (har har), so this sounded just amazing: roasted beets, panko crusted goat cheese, orange segments, mixed greens, red wine vinaigrette. This salad was delicious and then some. Since I was on a panko roll, I went with the panko + parmesan crusted chicken breast over roasted potatoes with caper aioli + arugula salad. Um, yeah, this was one of the most satisfying and savory entrees I had had in ages. It was also HUGE and included two huge pieces of chicken, so yay, I had leftovers).  The nosedive started, I believe, after our entrees came out. After we were finished, we sat there for about 10 minutes waiting for a sign from outer space. She came to get my food to box up. Somewhere in there she brought dessert menus and took our order for a molten chocolate cake to split, which was alright, but then she decided to, instead of being our server, wander in the outer orbit of Planet Bar in The Friend Galaxy and sent the bus boy to check in on us and bring us our bill. LAME! *Maybe* we looked like we weren't worth her time, but you know what, we would have tipped a lot better had she not written us off (we didn't tip poorly, just less than our pretty standard 20% for good service + food).",0.9971,0.784,0.178,0.038,0.6061706811706811

We asked questions about the wine, and our server didn't fake it: when she didn't know an answer, she went to get the bartender, and the four of us had a friendly little wine confab, and ended up with two to sample.  We were grateful for this, because even though it was a Tuesday, and the wines were half-off, we ended up preferring the second sample (a Chenin Blanc / Viognier) over the one we were initially leaning towards (a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc).  I'm not certain the two of us would have drank the entire bottle of our first choice quite so zealously. The Mr. had a black-bean jalapeno ravioli with a corn, red pepper, and black bean sauce, and the Ms. had the chicken breast stuffed with goat cheese over potato gnocchi.  Both were tasty yet neither could be said to be notably inspired.   Some thought has clearly been put into the design of the space, and it mostly coheres... colorful and soothing, the room was a pleasant place to spend a rainy night, although, nitpicking snobs that we are, we noticed a few glitches in the scheme (the chairs, for instance, seem wrong for the room). The best part of the experience was our server, who was personable without being overfamiliar, funny without being Wicker-Park smarmy, and who sent us off into the night smiling.  Not always that easy to do.",0.9767,0.818,0.13,0.052,0.5407056277056277
2006-09-16,4.0,"Pretty tasty, with only one complaint.  I'll just get that out of the way:  the chicken in my spicy chicken burrito was a little dodgy in quality. However, the rest of the meal tasted wonderful, and the breakfast potatoes that come with brunch/lunch dishes are marvelous.  I'm a little sad that I didn't order a Bloody Mary, because they looked amazing, and lots and lots of people were ordering them.  I think they must be good. There are a lot of restaurants in the Wicker Park area, so I'd like to try other ones before I go back here, but I'd recommend it.  They also have a large, nicely appointed outdoor seating area, a huge perk.",0.9589,0.76,0.201,0.039,0.7335317460317462

Most crab cakes use crab sparingly, they should be called bread crumb cakes. Not here. we're talking nice flaky crab, grilled nice & crusty. The Wife had the BBQ salmon over hotcakes, I had the stuffed chicken breast over gnocchi. I was the one with the case of entree envy this night. the bbq salmon was so good. I was jealous the minute they come to the table. anyhows, the salmon was crispy & flaky, and the hot cakes were just a bit spicy. so, this stack of tastiness is swimming in beautiful barbeque sauce and it's topped off with a cool kiss of guac. oh baby, i'm coming back for you! my chicken wasn't that bad. it just didn't have a chance. the skin was nice & crispy & the goat cheese was mild but tangy.

2006-08-10,3.0,"I went to Feast last night to ""mellow out"" after a rough week (well I guess it was only half a week since it was only Wednesday - oops!).  My girlfriend and I went pretty early - right after work.   The decor is cute - we sat outside in the garden area. The service was pretty average, nothing bad nothing great.  I did dig the bread basket with that buttery-cheese stuff - tasty indeed.  I did NOT like my martini because it was really small and  not strong enough.  I asked for a ""splash"" not a ""glass"" of cranberry.  I switched to wine and had a pretty decent Cabernet. The menu there is all over the place - there is a definite Mexican theme in there but also a lot of pasta dishes.  It was almost overwhelming.  For an appetizer we had guacamole.  The guac was fabulous - VERY fresh. The chips were OK but so thick I had to break each one in half.  I had the pork chop which was really great - thick and in some maple glazed sauce.  There were some sweet potato ""tacos"" under it.  Now that I write this I remember thinking the whole time that there were carrot strips in those tacos but they were sweet potato strips I guess - oops.  My friend got the goat cheese stuffed chicken over Gnocchi.  She liked it but I thought it was really bland. For dessert (yeah it was a really LONG and bad 1/2 a week) we split the special - strawberry rhubarb pie.  Very tasty. I think I will come back here again but there are other places in the area I will try or re-visit first.  I don't think the toddler next to us playing with some toy helped the overall experience.  This toy was mad annoying - it sang a little song over and over again.  By dessert I was ready to smash it into tiny pieces. *UPDATE 6/28/07* So I finally went back to Feast for brunch and boy was it hoppin'.  Although they do have a ton of tasty brunch beverages (GREAT mimosas and spicy bloodies) the food still falls a little flat.  Nothing really jumped out at me.  I had the turkey burger because all the brunch items were either too fishy or too Mexican-themed for me (wasn't in the mood for pico de gallo at all).  The turkey burger was OK but nothing great.  It had too much going on (like tons of cheese and onions).  I may come back for a liquidy lazy meal someday but I sure won't be running. . .",0.9952,0.811,0.16,0.029,0.5474759302628154

WHY in the world my friend and I needed champagne after imbibing at least a bottle of bubbly each this past Vegas weekend is beyond me, but it sure as hell hit the spot. The service can be a little iffy -- they took a while to get our bread to us, and then they were pretty slow in taking our order, but the servers were friendly and we weren't in any real hurry.
