2016-09-21,4.0,"Great byob spot in the old town area. Fish tasted pretty fresh and they offer a good mix of standard and more creative rolls. Mexican maki, crazy crumb, and the rainbow roll were all good. Also tried the seasonal pumpkin roll which was surprisingly delicious. Restaurant was also good about accommodating one of our parties no-mayo request. Ambiance doesn't provide much but overall its a pleasant and tasty BYOB sushi spot that's better than several others I've tried in the city",0.9707,0.687,0.295,0.018,0.5175925925925926
2016-09-18,2.0,"I went here for dinner with my husband and if you're expecting Japanese food, you will be disappointed. I would say this is some sort of fusion or Japanese-style food. The tempura was not made with a tempura batter since it didn't have the usual flakiness, but seemed more just like American-style onion ring batter. The chicken teriyaki did not taste like teriyaki and had a bunch of mushrooms over the top. The food tasted okay, but it was just a bit odd and not what we expected at all.",0.7836,0.824,0.124,0.052,0.4555555555555556

2016-09-11,1.0,Went in here on a rainy day.  I didn't see any fish in the display case.  That should have been a sign but I was hopeful.  The wait staff seemed friendly and the sushi chefs were nice too.  But when the udon came out and the broth tasted like soy sauce water and the noodles were way over cooked that's when I knew I was in trouble. Instant udon from the store would have tasted better.  Some of the sushi and maki rolls were decent.  The tempura was thick and heavy with no panko flakes. The broccoli tempura looked like it may have been a bit rotten before going in the batter.  Not sure if it would be called tempura at this point.  Hire a chef that can actually cook and maybe your food will actually taste good.  You could not pay me to eat here again.  Absolutely dumbfounded with the four star rating.,0.9456,0.738,0.174,0.088,0.5459401709401709

We tried several of the rolls and all were varying shades of delicious, my favorites being the crunchy, spicy tuna roll and and volcano roll.

2016-05-01,4.0,"Big fan of this place! Convenient location, near a brown line stop, relatively easy street parking,  very friendly staff. Intimate, cozy vibe without feeling squished with your next table dining partners. It's BYOB for $3pp and are kind enough to give you a bucket of ice and glassware for your drinks if you want it.  Came because I had a hankering for sushi, ended up getting the chicken katsu with curry, the Tiger roll, and the New York. The chicken katsu with curry came on a bed of rice with a salad on the side. Pretty filled for $15, the chicken katsu was well fried and tender, the Japanese curry was a little on the thick side and a little too sweet. Would've liked some other veggies besides just carrots, but all in all it was pretty tasty. The Tiger roll (fried soft shell crab, avocado, unagi sauce, and more) was pretty delicious. It was topped with a slice of tamago which really balanced out the savoriness with a hint of sweetness, and the unagi sauce with the other herbs put it over the top. The New York roll was surprisingly yummy too - with unagi and cream cheese inside, you could barely taste the unagi with the overpowering flavor of the cream cheese, but I certainly left happy. All in all, might just be my go-to easy sushi joint. If you're looking for high end sashimi or sushi experience, this isn't the place.

Everyone is very friendly - - the second or third time you eat here you will be addressed by name. They are always friendly. I worked in restaurants for nearly 15 years prior to my current career and when the food is consistently good and the staff cares about making you feel like a VIP, you have a winning combo.

The sushi was above average and better than what I was expecting.  We ordered the fried calamari, miso soup, seaweed salad, a few rolls and sashimi.  The fried calamari was great, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  It's very easy to overcook so was very impressed when it wasn't.  Miso soup was basic, not great, not bad.  The seaweed salad was good, but a bit too sweet for my preference.  The rolls were good, the crispy salmon skin was actually crispy! My personal gauge on how good a sushi place is is based on the freshness of the seafood.  I always get the Ikura (salmon roe) and the maguro (tuna).  The ikura was nearly tasteless, which to me is a sign that it isn't fresh.  The maguro was good, but still not the freshest I've had. Overall, it was better than I would have expected from a small neighborhood sushi place.  Can't be too hard on the place since this isn't the Bay Area or LA, but definitely good for the money and location.  Will be going back to check out the Katsu Curry!",0.9962,0.724,0.254,0.022,0.5142424242424243

You also get 10% off all cash orders. Just check the website to confirm the offers are still valid.

It was busy when we arrived without a reservation, but they took our number and gave us a call when the table was ready so we could grab a drink next door while we waited, which was nice.  We were seated at the sushi bar, which ended up good bc there were some larger really loud parties doing saki bombs and whatnot, so glad we had seats away from them where we could hear each other.  Food was overall pretty average, nothing bad, but just fairly standard decent sushi. Rolls were pretty small, which wasn't bad for the standard roll price points, but their speciality rolls were probably a bit pricey for the size. They also had a lot of rolls with cream cheese and smoked salmon, which are really the only two ingredients I'll never order in sushi.

I get it, we're trying to steer away from the fancy-edible-art-gastronomic types of meals and back to our familial roots. Believe me, if there's anyone that can appreciate using food as a coping mechanism, it's me.

It's a BYOB restaurant, which is always fantastic. If you forgo bringing your own bottle of wine, you can order one for a reasonable price ($20) at the restaurant.  Shiso makes super yummy and creative sushi rolls. My favorites, in order: 1. Sears Tower-- OH MY WORD. I could eat like five of these in one sitting. The whole has cream cheese, crab, clinator, asparagus, and unagi. Then it's deep fried, stacked up to look like a tower, and then drizzled with sweet sauce. Seriously, heavenly. A MUST TRY. 2. Mexican -- deep fried shrimp, avaocado, masago, jalapeno, and cilantro, covered with unagi sauce. I am not a fan of spicy food, but this is amazing.  3. Tiger -- deep fried soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, cilantro, masago mayo, topped with tamago and unagi sauce. So yummy. The waitresses are always super friendly and nice. They don't mind if you're there for a long, just hanging out and catching up with friends. The bill is always pretty decent too! If you're going with a group, I'd recommend calling ahead for a reservation, as space is tight and it's usually pretty busy.  BONUS -- they also deliver!!!

2014-06-24,2.0,"I'm not sure why this place has 4 stars. Nothing I tasted here was worthy of that, including the Sashimi Set, the Spicy Udon with Chicken, and the Sunset Roll. Sashimi Set - Average, nothing special. Not especially fresh. Spicy Udon with Chicken - The spicy sauce, drenched all over the noodles, was too creamy for my taste. It made the consistency almost like an alfredo spaghetti, which was weird because I always expect (and prefer) Japanese udon to be much lighter. Sunset Roll - Meh, very average. Also, It took us forever to even find a roll amongst the Specialty Rolls that didn't have cream cheese in it... clearly indicating that this is not a traditional Japanese restaurant - cream cheese in sushi is one trend I've never understood.

It was a good portion too. - takoyaki (octopus puff): delish!!! perfectly battered, perfectly juicy inside and perfectly flavored.  - Shumai: Our Japanese native friend said this was authentic to what shumai tasted like in her memories. I prefer the Chinese version with yellow skin.  - volcano: looks exactly what it sounds like and tastes pretty similar too when you picture ingredients exploding everywhere and mixing together. It was pretty meh for me but when we ordered we knew it was not going to be a roll that you could taste the different layers in. - shiso signature: i had high expectations for this since it was a signature dish. I ended up liking my friend's roll better. Note to self: whenever there are the words ""deep fried"" in a roll description, do not order, unless you are hungover. - sakura (i think): either sakura or whatever roll that has the least amount of condiments/sauces in the description. The fish was fresh and the amount of avacado was just enough to help the food slide into your esophagus. - sears tower: kudos to the restaurant for keeping it sears towers instead of Willis tower. Taste-wise, I could care less coz the presentation was just priceless. We came up with various interpretations of what they looked like. You'll have to see it for yourself.

Salmon sashimi - sashimi here is ordered by the piece, so we got 4 pieces.  It was on the lean side (not a plus in my book), and thin, small-ish pieces.

In hindsight, we should have stopped for some supermarket sushi instead.  If I can describe Shiso in one word, I would say it is boring. Our waitress was boring, and we ordered 5 boring rolls. 4 ""city maki"" rolls, and a ""dragon roll"". You know a sushi place is not good when the California roll is the best tasting roll, and you feel umm...the ""safest""...eating that roll. The worst roll by far was the Philadelphia roll - it took a little bit too long to chew it and it just did not taste right. I couldn't tell if it was the heavy cream cheese or the fish causing this strangeness, but I was sketched out nonetheless. Not what I'm looking for in sushi. The dragon roll was topped with eel, but tasted like sardines. It was so bad that we had to take the eel off the roll to eat it.  We were both very confused that this place earned more stars on yelp than other Sushi places in the area.

The most brilliant thing is that while there are certainly opportunities to order $12-15 maki, there are a number of VERY good options at the $7-9 range as well (crunchy spicy tuna & mexican are my 2 personal favs in this category). I've added two rolls to my top 5 so I'll just mention those here:  Mango Tango: crab, mango, sweet potato tempura, avocado, topped with hamachi, spicy mayo, and green onion. As delicious as the ingredients make it sound Mexican: deep fried shrimp, cilantro, avocado, jalapeno, unagi. I'm a sucker for maki with textural contrast, but this one knocks it out of the park for $7. On a side note: the service was MUCH stronger on a weeknight compared to my previous weekend forays.

They arrived at 7pm and my buddy and I wanted to wait til the end of the NCAA final 4 game before we came, we were right down the street. We arrived casually late around 7:40pm. The whole time, I was getting repeated text messages asking whether we were coming or not. Because of the limited amount of tables at Shiso, the restaurant was demanding to know because they were threatening to take away our reserved tables for other customers. Yes, we were coming. We were late, it happens. Chill out, Shiso. This wasn't the only rude thing about the staff. Our party was told that we had to be gone by 8:30pm because of another reservation. Really? Sorry if we are inconveniencing you by trying to give you our business.  We showed up late and promptly order our rolls to split between 2 of us. We were hungry and ordered a healthy amount. We were slightly intoxicated already, so I imagine anything would have tasted good, but every roll we ordered was exceptionally good. Beer goggles for the stomach?  The Shiso Signature was good. I'm not a fan of maki with cream cheese but I didn't think there was an overpowering taste. Jalapeno was not too spicy and a nice touch. Tokyo Tower was also very very good. Fried Asparagus inside was a nice crunch and spicy shrimp on top was delicious. Seaweed salad inside as well. This was my favorite. The Volcano was also good. Hamachi inside with avocado and masago with delicious sauces. Also very good but you're basically paying $14 for the sauces on top. We added another roll but I forgot because I had been drinking for 7+ hours at this point.  Our bill for 2 of us was a healthy $80 for our 30 minutes of enjoyment (guess that happens when you let me order while intoxicated with no parameters on price). The 8:30pm reservation was hovering over our table by that time so we finished up our bottles and continued the night elsewhere.  Overall, 4 stars for food, 2 stars for service. I got the impression (and from other reviews) that this place is great for a date of 2 people and not for bigger groups because of the limited space.

Dining at Shiso was quite refreshing since it's been awhile coming across a place that pays attention to so much detail. From the place settings, interior decorating, service, to the food itself, everything was handled with care and attention.  We ordered the pumpkin roll which was a seasonal special. It was a creative roll that used a Japanese squash with a sweat aftertaste. We also ordered the spicy scallop nigiri and spicy scallop roll. The one weak point was the flavor of the spicy mayo. The spicy rolls weren't spicy at all and sometimes you just want a kick with your sushi. What's a spicy tuna roll if it isn't spicy?  Shiso is a great local spot and adds new creative rolls depending on the season. If they can bring the heat on the spicy mayo and continue offering excellent innovative rolls, Shiso can stand out amongst the sea of sushi restaurants in Chicago.",0.9485,0.834,0.132,0.034,0.6357838589981447

Spicy miso soup was good, the Ginger dressing on the salad weird but ok, the tempura ice cream was terrific.

2011-04-04,3.0,"For a long time Cafe Sushi was the only BYOB sushi game in Old Town. I'm glad there are more BYOB options in this hood, especially BYOB sushi options. I wish they popped up when I lived a block away; although if they did, I'd might have gone broke or suffered ""mercury toxicity"" a la Jeremy Piven. Located on North Avenue, a few blocks west of Sedgwick, Shiso's storefront is easy to pass up, but a welcome addition to the sparse Old Town dining choices west of Wells. It was dead when we arrived and packed by the time we left about 90 minutes later on a Wednesday; I recommend reservations if you plan on dining at 7 or later. We started out with an order of edamame. Either we got a pretty generous serving or I was the only one in the party who was bananas over edamame. Shiso's sushi menu is quite robust; we ordered five rolls, which was perfect for our group of four. We ordered spicy tuna, rainbow, latin, dragon and shrimp tempura. I'm more partial rolls with only raw ingredients, but they all were good. I also gravitate toward simpler rolls, but found the spicy tuna only ok. They mince the tuna in this roll, which is a pet peeve of mine as I think you lose a lot of the fish taste. Service was very hands off. The restaurant was empty the first half of our meal, but our server wasn't really anywhere in sight. We had to flag her down both to place our order and get our check. Also, we were never offered an ice bucket to keep our second bottle of wine cold, yet the table that arrived later got one. It wasn't bad or even unfriendly service, just inattentive. Our bill for 4 people was $18 each including tip, which I thought was pretty reasonable. Considering it's also BYOB without any corking fee, it felt like a steal. Cafe Sushi is still my preferred BYOB destination in Old Town, but I'd definitely make a return visit here or carry out; it's actually quite convenient from the Brown Line and #11 bus. 3.5 stars",0.9853,0.791,0.142,0.067,0.5037606837606838

Ive been passing it for a few weeks now and decided to duck in for some veggies and seaweed. The fact that it was BYOB just made the night a better place. I'm very basic with my sushi...or maki rolls as I've been hounded to say since I don't eat fish. We started with edamame which was blazing hot but very tasty. Not too salty which is a good thing and edamame is notorious for being oversalted. We had a bottle of a wine and there was no corkage fee. Sweet! For dinner I went with a sweet potato tempura roll and kappa roll. TASTY! I was shocked by how much I loved the sweet potato roll. There was a spicy sauce covering the rolls which added more kick. The kappa rolls were cool, light, and refreshing. I also want to note that it was nice to have wooden chopsticks. I'm not a chopstick fan and usually make a fool of myself dropping sushi and tofu all over myself in front of people. Not the case tonight! The chopsticks were very easy to grab my pieces. I have to say, I wasn't stunned by Shiso, but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it for a nice quiet night out with a friend. Check it out!",0.9903,0.756,0.182,0.063,0.5349526369687659

2010-01-03,3.0,"I worked at a Japanese restaurant for three years, so I may be more critical than others.  We decided to try this place since many other Japanese places were closed.  We tried six of the appetizers and the beef teriyaki:   Tempura- two large shrimp, two pieces of sweet potato, one onion ring, one broccoli floret overall not too bad.  The tempura batter wasn't as light and crispy as other places, but the sauce was nice (they serve the ginger on the side so that you may add it to taste).     Gyoza- six pan fried dumplings that arrived at our table still cold on the inside that didn't have any remarkable flavor, served with a sauce that didn't help too much either.   Agedashi tofu three 1.5"" square pieces of fried tofu that was served in a sauce that again came with ginger on the side.  This was a great tasting dish that had nice contrast between the tofu itself and the sauce.  The only thing that could make it better is if the tofu was a little crispier. Rolled beef sticks- four pieces of thinly sliced overcooked meat wrapped around green onions and asparagus.  No one at the table liked this one- avoid it unless you have a particular affinity for exercising your masseter. Takoyaki four pieces- nicely sized- larger that average with a piece of baby octopus tentacle inside.  Beautifully garnished with Tonkatsu sauce, Japanese mayo, and bonito flakes.  These also tasted spot on. Wakame salad  This was my favorite appetizer.  It was as described- seaweed salad over mixed greens.  It was delicious and very well portioned.  I have paid almost double for the seaweed salad alone in other establishments, making this one not only tasty, but a great value.   Beef teriyaki  This sounded great on paper, but its execution and presentation were questionable.  It looked like a handful of very thinly sliced, but not tender beef that was thrown into a skillet and sauteed with mushrooms.   I guess that's the difference between ""beef teriyaki"" and other establishments' ""Steak teriyaki.""  The mushrooms definitely overpowered the teriyaki flavor, but i guess you get what you pay for- it was only around twelve dollars.   Every single plate came garnished in an identical manner- bit of greens with a swirl of shredded carrot on top, even the teriyaki beef had a larger version of the above with some spicy mayo dribbled onto the greens. The service was very prompt and courteous, especially for a busy Saturday night.  Overall this place was nice on a night that other Japanese restaurants were closed, but I do not think that I'd choose Shiso over  many others.",0.9961,0.796,0.158,0.046,0.5452179176755448

I would say the rolls were pretty creative, tasty and fresh. There were a couple that weren't as good as others, but overall still decent. 6 rolls for 3 girls was a bit much.

Regardless we were ready to get our sushi on...  The menu had lots of regular and specialty rolls to choose from. And I also noticed they are escolar happy in lots of those specialty rolls. Unfortunately, I had a bad escolar experience about a year ago in Houston, but I'm trying to get back on the escolar bandwagon. While my friends ordered one of the specialty rolls with escolar I decided to keep things simple last night. Some miso soup, some gomae, and a shrimp tempura roll.  Probably not the best idea to eat spinach and a fried roll with a stomach ache, but I'm a glutton for punishment. While miso soup, gomae, and a shrimp tempura roll isn't the best judge of a sushi restaurant I thought it to be on par with most of the other sushi spots i frequent in the city.  And my friends found their specialty rolls to be average. It's a pretty no frills place (they use ikea cups) with a few pretty light fixtures thrown in to spice it up.  After a hard workout we were sans alcohol, but I'm guessing BYOB is the main draw at Shiso.

2009-07-01,4.0,"BYOB sushi! How I love you. I chose this spot for my sister's bachelorette weekend. There were seven of us who ate here before heading over to a Second City show. I made a reservation about a week out without any problems.  They had our table ready right when we arrived. It's a smaller place, but we had a great table set up between the entryway and the sushi bar. It was nice and kind of separated from the rest of the restaurant. Again, BYOB with great service. The server immediately took our bottles of wine, put the whites on ice and brought glasses out for everyone. There did appear to be a bit of a language barrier, but it wasn't a big problem.  We ordered plenty of sushi and got to try quite a bit. It was very good. They do a lot of that deep-fying stuff that tastes good, but definitely isn't authentic. We only got maki, since my companions didn't like anything else, so I can't attest to the freshness of their nigiri or sashimi. The rolls were great, though maybe a tiny bit light on the actual fish. Still, very yummy and lots of inventive flavors. Many rolls had cilantro, jalapeno, etc.  The Sears Tower was expensive, but delicious. It was another one that was mostly rice and cream cheese with some eel, veggies and crap and tempura fried, but it tasted very good. The super white tuna with scallion was a great choice reco'd by our server and I could actually taste the fish with that one. I also liked the salad roll which was a bit silly, but still fun. It was basically a salad wrapped with rice and seaweed with a ginger dressing to dip it in. Tasty.  Again, this isn't maybe the place for authentic sushi, but the maki was very good, the atmosphere is clean, modern and trendy. I'd definitely come back, especially if I'm with a sushi newbie who's a tad nervous.",0.9979,0.741,0.231,0.027,0.602862950058072

However, it was a low key evening and Shiso matched the mood.  No wait. Great service. Gotta love no corkage for a BYOB.  The food was excellent.

My lovely lady friends and I shared some fantastic rolls, a bottle of red, a bottle of the most darling-named white, and some sake last week.  And we were loving just about everything we ordered.  Miso soup and edamame all around to start (tasty, pretty standard)...and onto the rolls. We enjoyed a Philly roll (pretty typical) and a spicy tuna (just kinda OK), but the real standouts were the Sear Tower roll (typo intended) and the super top-secret magic roll the sushi chef whipped up for us at the end.   The Sears Tower roll is presented so cutely ala our very own Sears Tower and full of tempura-fried goodness. Also going doing super-smooth were the Latin roll (holy spicy) and the Crazy Crump (which I insisted we order solely for the crazy and crump-tastic name).  Service was friendly and prompt, and our server had lovely suggestions.  Props to the chefs for whipping us up that fabulous combo roll.  We loooooved it!

2009-03-30,4.0,"Shiso-fine. A shout out to KJ, as sister, we're coming. I'm no Trixie, but Shiso-mine. Perhaps we can dine a trois? Every good chef gives something to his or her food that's soulful and inspiring and rich in meaning. I can imagine for most sushi chefs, California rolls are akin to paint-by-numbers or caricatures. You can make an honest living, perhaps, but you're not being true to yourself. And so it's a real testament to the chef to remark, ""Make whatever you like."" That's how our meal concluded at Shiso. He had earned our trust through playful palette foreplay (spicy salmon, Chicago roll, Sears Tower roll artfully plated), and we decided to sit for a portrait, allowing him to be inspired. The grand finale did not disappoint. I knew we would be pleased when our request for unadulterated creativity made our cherub-esque waitress smile. Like a street dancer called to an audition on Broadway. Let 'er rip, girlfriend! We polished off the last of our Pancake Cellars white and savored the final bits of a roll garnished with a lovely dusting of what looked like dill. Each bite held chewy nori and lush salmon, and mouthfuls of salty globular tobiko.  What a masterful exhibition. Nothing disappointed, and the chef's best guess was spot on.

2009-03-28,4.0,"Shiso...sushi ho. Indeed.  Let's face it, pop-up sushi spots are a dime a dozen, so they've gotta pack a little punch to impress.  Shiso hits the mark: BYOB, stylish interior, intimate setting, Old Town location, fresh rolls that border on inventive, but won't scare away the Cali lovers (I'm one, so not hate here, yo!).  It's actually a bit off the main strip, so I think it may got a bit unnoticed. North Avenue is a tad busy along this stretch...and you might just blow by it. Not a terrible amount of foot traffic, but it still emits a warm, intimate vibe despite being located on IL-64, or whatever highway North Ave masquerades as...the good news: meters are easy to come by. The bad, well, the meters consume quarters like I consume unagi. A lot. Come prepped with a roll or two...no pun intended. ;)  BYOB: my gal pals and I were rollin' deep with a white, red and sake...and the wine glasses were whipped out accordingly. An ice bucket for the white would've been a nice touch, but I don't complain when I am packin' my own. Refills on water were aplenty... Food: mmmm, let me pause for a brief second to recollect....there were some average: Philly, spicy tuna. Then there were some stellar: Sear(s) Tower (piled high, tempura fried, can you go wrong? no), Latin (Shiso spicy!), Crunk (this isn't the name, but something similar...also spicy, as I got a huge chunk of jalepeno). We were all still a weeeeeee bit hungry (I know, right, go figure), so we had them bring out a chef's selection and they whipped us up something fierce...yet to be presented on the menu. Therefore, I have no idea what was in it, what its named, or any of that business...but I am here to tell you, it was all sparkly and fabulous, even for sushi.  Service: On step. Not a glitch all night...not overly friendly, but certainly knowledgeable and accommodating, and really...what more do we need when we are consuming our own wine? NOTHING. I am complete.

2009-01-04,4.0,"On a whim, I decided to plan a surprise birthday dinner for my fiancee.  After doing some research on Yelp, I ended up choosing Shiso because it's close to our home and because the fiancee is a big fan of BYOB sushi joints.  It ended up being a good call for the following reason: Accommodating Staff: The nice folks at Shiso were cool with last minutes updates to the reservation as well as my bringing in a couple birthday cakes, for which they provided plates and forks.  Even though I had brought in some cakes, they were nice enough to throw in a complimentary tempura green tea ice cream on the house as well as a gift certificate for a salad and appetizer for a future visit.  There were times that some of the servers seemed a bit stressed out but it might have been because it was a packed house that night. Good Food: Others have commented on Shiso's liberal use of mayo and cream cheese but I didn't get that impression.  To be fair, we ordered two makis and neither had cream cheese or an abundance of mayo.  We also ordered the agedashi tofu, which were nice and plump and came in a flavorful ginger broth, and the sashimi deluxe, which was good except I don't like how they pass off imitation crab as one of the pieces of sashimi. Kickass Prices: Everything at Shiso is very affordable, especially considering its location.  The prices are comparable with many of the sushi joints up north and the fact that it's BYOB with no corkage fee only means less dollars that you'll have to spend. Ambiance: My only gripe with Shiso is that it gets really really loud inside the restaurant.  This was not surprising considering that the place can probably only seat a maximum of 40 people.  But once the other tables filled up, it became very difficult to hold a conversation.  There's nothing that Shiso can necessarily do about the noise; just more of an FYI in case you're hoping for a quiet dinner.

Well, I'm so glad we ate there in advance, because I would have been so embarrased.
