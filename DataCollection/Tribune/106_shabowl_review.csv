2016-11-14,5.0,Great food and the man (the owner I'm guessing) was very kind and on it even though he was completely on his own! The portions are very big and filling. I wasn't expecting the meat in the bibimbap to be very good but it was a lot better than I expected. Their boba milk teas are to die for.  Definitely recommend stopping here!,0.8867,0.654,0.253,0.093,0.6066666666666667
2016-10-15,5.0,Great tofu shabowl and Thai milk boba. Love that it's a family business but with a modern take on traditional cuisine. Definitely will return and recommend to others,0.899,0.648,0.352,0.0,0.5800000000000001
2016-10-14,3.0,This place is just ok. I got spring rolls and chicken pho. The spring rolls were good but the dipping sauce was much too salty (as in inedible). The soup was good too and nice to have since I was fighting a cold but I've had better.,0.8934,0.676,0.266,0.058,0.66875

2016-08-27,4.0,"Shabowl is a neat, little gem that I found the past summer. My favorite thing to get is the chicken shabowl, but the steak shabowl is nice too! Also, get the smoothies if you see the Asian mom that runs place during the weekends! The only downside is the lack of space when there are many customers.",0.428,0.785,0.13,0.086,0.65
2016-08-19,5.0,I love myself a bibimbap bowl and this shabowl is basically one. I got the chicken shabowl and I couldn't be more pleased. Great flavor and glaze on the chicken. I'm definitely coming back again when I'm on armitage. My milk tea was also good.,0.911,0.682,0.269,0.05,0.6499999999999999
2016-08-10,5.0,"This smallish, well put together place offers a variety of dishes borrowing from Korean and Vietnamese favorites and has infused its menu with Filipino goodness. I was hungry so I ordered fried rice which can be boring at some places, but not here! The portion was generous, the ingredients tasted fresh, the flavors were distinct, and the gochujang sauce available was delicious. This place hasn't been around long but if word gets out I can see them serving up tastiness for years to come.",0.948,0.786,0.196,0.018,0.5142857142857143
2016-08-01,5.0,Shabowl is a great place to eat if you're looking for something new to eat in Lincoln Park. They have very tasty Chicken Rice bowls and sandwiches. It helps to order over the phone just  in case they are really busy. Also their staff is really nice and friendly:),0.8687,0.821,0.179,0.0,0.6568181818181817

2016-07-31,2.0,"Shabowl bills itself as Asian fusion, but it has a heavy bent towards Filipino food accompanied by bubble tea.  I think that Filipino food tends towards the drier side (where the flavor is in the meat marinade instead of a sauce), and I found my dish kind of dry. It is a more affordable and quick eat for this neighborhood, so I enjoyed. However, there are other Asian fusion places that pack a lot more flavor and textures into their dishes.",0.7822,0.926,0.074,0.0,0.4575
2016-07-26,4.0,"Been here a couple of times as I happen to be round the neighborhood. The food is very delicious. First time I tried the chicken adobo. Well seasoned, not spicy (as I like it) and very flavorful. Second time I had potstickers and chicken fried rice. The fried rice has a combination of flavors both typical of fried rice and some added fresh vegetables and some pineapple chucks. The smoothies are also very tasty.  The place is a small place tucked away a bit from the street. It must be family run as it seems the teenagers of the household are in the front at times. Worth the trip and the stop if one is around. The only thing I have bit of issue with is the ""music"" they play in the place, but that could a generational gap challenge.",0.63,0.901,0.076,0.023,0.49880952380952376
2016-07-18,5.0,"Admittedly the lackluster street sign doesn't give you much hope for this little gem but there's a certain virtue in the focus on what matters - the food.  Vietnamese, Filipino, Korean - whatever this   Asian mashup is - it's delectable.  I'm personally more of a fan of rice bowls as general genre and the Shabowl's are outstanding, but I plan to delve into the Bahn Mi's at some juncture...once I've had enough Shabowl's to get it out of my system.",0.974,0.739,0.261,0.0,0.4558035714285714
2016-07-12,5.0,"Yum! What a great addition to Armitage! We are lacking in the food department over here, and I am so happy Shabowl is open and serving delicious food! Tonight my fiance and I ordered both the Tofu and Beef Shabowl with egg rolls. All three were great! I would liken a Shabowl to a Bibimbap! Huge portion size compared to other restaurants that serve a similar product. Quick turn over time. Marisol, the woman who works there is super sweet! Support this local restaurant and give it a try. It will not disappoint! P.S. They offer brown rice too! Will definitely be back! I am very full and satisfied!

The first time I ordered the tofu banh mi, this time I got the chicken banh mi with a taro boba tea for $2 (combo). Both tasty, what i would expect from a banh mi sandwich.

2016-06-26,3.0,"I have been waiting for a Vietnamese restaurant to open up in Lincoln Park that would be comparable with the uptown restaurants, but looks like I will have to wait till the next one. I tried the bahn Mi which was okay minus there was one small piece of cilantro, one jalapeño, way too much mayo, and the meat was a bit salty. The shrimp spring rolls are made with red pepper and basil vs the standard mint and bean sprouts. Besides the shrimp being whole and ripping the rice paper on both rolls and therefore unable to be eaten correctly, I was not disappointed in the flavor. I will be back to try the Pho and hope it tastes authentic (unlike FUH in Lincoln Park).",0.915,0.9,0.1,0.0,0.3153846153846154

2016-05-16,3.0,"Swung by for lunch Sunday afternoon. The space doesn't look much diff from the former Red Mango. I ordered the beef pho as boo got the beef shabowl. We also got an order of the lumpia. It wasn't until well after placing our order and paying that they told us they were out of the beef pho. I opted for the chicken pho. They should have refunded us the $1 difference or offered something, but they didn't. They did not even acknowledge the price difference. I didn't bring it up on my end, as I didn't want things to get more complicated, as the guy already seemed to struggle. To note, I would have still given this place 3 stars even if they did correct their error.  The eggrolls came out fairly quickly. They were pretty tasty, although I found the accompanied sauce to be a tad too sweet. While the rest of our order didn't take terribly long to come, I thought for a casual establishment, they would have been more efficient. We were the only customers there at this point, but a solid lunch crowd came soon in after. Boo enjoyed his bowl very much as he noted to be similar to a bibimbap. Proportions looked good and they even used some more interesting veggies. I enjoyed my chicken pho as well, as the broth was nice and light. My qualms involve the service and ambience of the place. The guy that took our order while nice definitely needed some work. Another customer asked what an item was and I saw that he had to read the menu description himself to know and simply reiterated what he read. The other guy working who brought us out our food also seemed aloof. I also heard that they were out of brown rice. Very annoying when a place is out of things, considering their menu isn't huge. The place is also kinda depressing, in that it could really use some music and/or art to liven up the place. It was also awkward to see the same cashier guy when not taking orders, prepare the napkin/utensil bundles right at the counter.  Hopefully this place is here to stay as the food is pretty good and fills an Asian void on the Armitage strip. However, they definitely have their work cut out. I do like that they have a spread of Filipino/Viet/Korean items on the menu. Since they are still new, I will give it another shot. If much is the same, I will likely give 2 stars then.",0.9933,0.804,0.142,0.054,0.575559750327192
2016-05-09,5.0,"Went to this restaurant today after randomly choosing it on my walk with a friend of mine and was pleasantly surprised. Besides the food being great, the owner(?)/chef was so wonderful! He was short staffed so he seemed a little flustered at first but ended up being so helpful and sweet and friendly. Even made us some fried banana slices to make up for ""dealing with him"", which is ridiculous because he was great! This is just an awesome spot to get some quick, good Asian food. I had the beef pho and my friend had the beef bowl and they were both delicious. New businesses need/deserve some patience from customers :)",0.9946,0.615,0.355,0.03,0.6521043771043771
2016-05-08,1.0,"FYI - this review is based on service only, as I did not try the food.  This place just opened and I was excited to try it out.  I walked in and there was only one customer in front of me and they didn't seem to order any food, but just sat down.  I was not greeted or given any attention by the two individuals working there.  I probably stood at the counter for 5 minutes - one employee was on the phone and did not acknowledge me and the other left out the front door without a word to me.  I was standing there somewhat shocked.  I gave it a bit more time and the one employee did not get off the phone or gesture to me, and the other did not return.  So I decided to leave.  Quite an unfortunate experience for a new establishment.  Will not be returning.",-0.8115,0.902,0.024,0.075,0.5948576675849403
