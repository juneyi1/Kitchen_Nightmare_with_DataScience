2016-09-17,1.0,"Let's start off by saying I loved the boystown location... we showed up for out 9pm reservation about 10 minutes early, the host let us know it was a 20 minute wait and to grab a seat at the bar. No worries considering we made the reservation only an hour in advance... then walking to the bar we see no less so than 4 empty 2 tops... on the reservation wrote requested outside seating so just assumed we were waiting to go out, again no big deal. We sit at the bar and the bartender instantly asked if we were just waiting for a table.. odd but ok. So I said yes but we'd love a drink while we wait he walks away comes back 10 minutes later with water.. I then say can we order a drink too? He say oh yeah so we order, 20 minutes later he let's us know he is starting our drinks.... mind you it's a 12 seat bar at Max and everyone there is waiting for a table. Not to mention they have a bartender dedicated to the dining area. I brush it off and then the host let's us know the table is ready he walks us back to a table that was open when we walked in and not outside... well that's annoying. We sat at the table for 15 minute finished our drinks and without a server, busser, host.. anyone we just left. Wish I could have reviewed the food, but apparently they just weren't ready to open...sad really because the drink was good, but not good enough to risk having to wait another hour for dinner. Just sad to see such a good place fall do far.",0.98,0.79,0.138,0.071,0.41075268817204297

Walked in and got a 15 minute wait even though there were open tables. But the wait is fine. We get seated and waited for a good ten minutes and to be honest I don't think they even know we left. I hope it's an off night. Decided to eat across the street.",0.9236,0.716,0.216,0.067,0.4333333333333333
2016-09-14,4.0,"Stopped here for a couple of drinks and an appetizer. It was fairly early, 6:45 so fairly empty. The host, who was fairly indifferent and not exceptionally friendly sat us per our request outside. The waiter was attentive and quickly brought our drinks and Brussel sprouts. They were excellent, perfectly seasoned with crispy bacon. On our way out the bartender made a point to say goodbye... The host on the other hand not so much. Â A little acknowledgment goes a long way, especially for a business that just recently opened in Andersonville where there are a lot of options.",0.668,0.813,0.105,0.082,0.5303571428571429
