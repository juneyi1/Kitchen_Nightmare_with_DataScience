I finally went for dinner and was really pleasantly surprised by how good everything was! Got the mussels to start. The broth and bread were delicious and flavorful. We had to ask for more than the two texas toast size pieces provided, and our server happily obliged. I probably should've thought about that a little more since I ordered the fried chicken sliders which came on similar delicious toast! The sliders were amazing. I ended up not eating most of the buns/toast they were on, but there was a delicious honey drizzle under the buns that was great for sopping the chicken. Very light breading and excellent flavor to the chicken and a really good amount of chicken (3 sliders) for $12. I think this is listed as an appetizer, but it could easily be a full meal (even without my gorging on the mussels).  The wine was also a great deal. Though we finished our ($9!) bottle of malbec, you can take wine to go, and there is a wide range of prices for wines by the glass and bottle--but with prices $7 and up for bottles, who's getting a glass? I'm eager to head back for brunch sometime soon and would highly recommend this spot to any fried chicken or wine enthusiast.",0.9981,0.723,0.277,0.0,0.6677419354838708

(They also have a gluten free fried chicken available which surprised me). The fried chicken is delicious - crispy, without too much breading and very moist.  The jalapeno in the batter gives it nice balanced flavor.  It was a heaping portion that I just couldn't get through it, but it made good leftovers.  It came with collard greens which were okay but I preferred the breakfast potatoes.  The atmosphere is okay - it does have more of a ""chain"" vibe that seems a bit out of place for the neighborhood. Service was good both times.  Our waitress was knowledgeable about wine and the cocktails.  Their wine list is pretty big.  Their bloody mary for brunch had a nice kick to it (and comes with a fried chicken wing).

My brunch companion ordered the Scooby Doo, which were chocolate chip pancakes with a dollop of marshmallow fluff and sprinkled with graham crackers.  She proclaimed it delicious (but how could it not be?) and it was something like $11. The mimosa bar was very cool indeed: $5 got you a glass of champagne + grapefruit juice (as opposed to the normal orange juice) and a candy buffet to accompany it.  They had gummy bears, Peach-O's, Twizzlers (bite off the end and use it as a straw!), candied watermelon pieces and a few others to add to your mimosa. Our server, Claire, was genuine and attentive.  They featured some very spiffy wall art and had a 'retro' brunch going, with cartoons showing on their TV's and they had out toys like Connect4 and Hungry Hungry Hippos.  I was a huge fan of this, since I grew up with these un-board games, and I totally kicked Caty D's ass at a highly competitive game of Don't Break The Ice (needless to say, she broke the ice).

Kinda strange.  I've never been told this and it was a bit awkward having to sit separately from the rest of our group. We ordered wine and appetizers.  Both were amazing!  I got a Malbec and we shared the bison sliders, mac and cheese and fried brie. The mac and cheese was some of the best I've had.  This place is great for small, shared plates.  Kudos to the chef! The decor was super fun! I loved the low lit lighting.  We felt very comfortable there.  I did find it a bit strange that their unopened inventory and boxes were stacked up by the bathrooms.  Like, 50 something boxes? The servers were super friendly even though they can't handle a table of 12. They were great at giving us advice on wines and food choices.  After finishing our food and closing our tab a few of us decided to stay and have a few more glasses of wine.  For some reason once we closed the tab the servers disappeared and we started walking to the bar for wine. This was fine until they told us if we were going to go to the bar we had to sit at the bar and if we wanted to keep our table we would have to have a server. Well, where did our server go?

2014-12-19,4.0,"Lawd Haffa Mercy! Yearsssss ago, one of my Instagram friends took a picture of some fried chicken and tagged that they were eating at Max's Wine Dive... I had never heard of the place and upon conducting some further research, I found out that they were in Texas. Years later, to my surprise and excitement, the franchise has decided to open locations outside of Texas and so far have landed in Atlanta and now Chicago! Seeing that I recently vacationed in Chicago, I could not pass the opportunity up to see what all the hype is about and let me tell you... I now understand! The service was on point, my waiter was attentive and spoke about the menu with ease without a need to verify anything with the chef which is impressive for a new restaurant opening. This place was decorated so that you could lay back and let your hair down with keeping it classy. It's warm and had an artificial fireplace. The bar is large and long and there are options of sitting high or low. The store has large window fronts so you can people watch and the kitchen is somewhat open! The food... The Fried Chicken with Mash Potatoes and Greens - the chicken was fried perfectly... There is a hint of jalapeño pepper embedded into the batter which gives it a nice kick in every bite, the chicken comes out hot from the fryer and the pieces are nice in size. The skin is crispy and is not bogged down in grease! The mash potatoes were a little lack luster and could use additional butter and salt but are whipped well. The greens were pretty good (was my first time having them), they were a great pair with the chicken! The Egg Sandwich with chips - ooooooooooook, I got this JUST BECAUSE and this actually blew me out the water (seriously)! Every aspect of that sandwich was seasoned, the eggs had salt and black pepper, the tomato was heated, the truffle aioli gave the sandwich a taste of heavenly bliss and nice texture, the bread was crispy and the bacon was crispier  - I don't recall all the elements but the sandwich was good folks! My only drawback was that it was on the greasy side but sh*t that didn't matter, also the sandwich is HUGH! The chips were house made and were truffle and fresh out the fryer and added some additional crisps that you were already getting from the sandwich... It was a nice pairing... Overall a simple sandwich taken to another level by the right ratio of seasoning!  They only serve wine and champagne which is a bummer for me, I needed my soda for a meal of this standard + I'm not big on wine or champagne so I just ordered champagne to have some type of buzz but it just didn't do it for me... Max please get bottles of soda for people like me! What I love about this restaurant is that it's not about the fancy spancy, it's about taking well known southern comfort foods and placing the right seasonings with the correct execution as opposed to getting outside the box and creating a disaster (which so many places seem to be doing today). Overall a TASTY experience and I cannot wait to return here again... Is it the best damn chicken I ever ate? No ...Is it tasty and one of my top choices for chicken spots?

The $6 house wine was surprisingly decent. Now the story - came here on a date on a Sunday afternoon. The wines by the glass were between 6 and $12. My date and I had two in the 8-11$ range and for the third I asked for a recommendation for something similar to the first one I had. She brought me two tastes without saying which was which...I like where this is going so far. Says the first was one that she had recommended from the by the glass list ($10), and the second was a bottle not usually by the glass that they had open. I liked the second one better so I asked for a glass of it. Sure enough when the bill came it was $25 or $27 for that glass or something like that. Am I naive to think that by playing this blind taste test game I would be tasting two comparable things?

It's not a big deal but the place wasn't packed at all, and it was the end of brunch so I'm pretty sure everyone there had already ordered. Anyways, our waitress never came in those thirty minutes to see how we were doing or if needed anything else.  The food came out and it was pretty good. I liked the chicken, and it came with potatoes and colored greens. It also had a little cup with spicy honey, which was interesting. It was a really big portion, so at the end I asked for a to-go box. The waitress said okay and went to the bar. I thought she was going to bring me a box, but she just started fixing some glasses. We waited for a couple of minutes, and nothing...I went to the restroom before we left and nothing...We ended up just paying and leaving. It wasn't worth getting frustrated over.

I usually get the french toast and then eat most of my boyfriend's fried chicken, but I got my own order this time, and something was off on it. The flavors seemed different. We were really upset that when we asked for syrup, because our friend's was only half full the waitress brought it out, end of story. We got the bill and he had been charged an extra dollar to get another only half full syrup. It's only a dollar, so no biggie, but it was the principle of the fact that she hadn't mentioned there was a charge.

I literally have not seen her since our HS graduation in June of 1999 (Class of 99, woot! woot!). We have been Facebook friends for some years now, and we've always made the declaration that we were going to get together and catch up, but between her schedule and my schedule, it was hard to find a common date where we were both available. So we made a conscience effort to make sure that Oct 9th 2014 at 6:30pm was dedicated to us getting together for a drink! lol. She recommended Max's Wine Dive. Im totally down after I saw the website. We met up and i loved the environment, it was intimate yet casual, off to a great start. They have a great selection of drinks which is always a plus. Our server, I cant remember his name but he was a brotha, probably 5' 5"" or so, with glasses. Friendly kat where it seemed like he would kinda let us hang since he overheard us saying ""I haven't seen you since HS! OMG"" and all that good stuff (he mentioned it, that's how I know he overheard us). After a little bit, he asked if we were going to eat. He recommended the wing special which was 5 wings for $5. So we put in 3 orders of wings (not knowing the size). We were talking, the conversation is going great and the liquor is tasting wonderful. The Wings get to our table and they were HUGE!! WOW! And I thought Harold's Wings were big! They were big, crunchy and delicious! LOVE IT! We already knew we were going to take some home, no way in the world we'd be able to finish em. So We were there for a while, and mind you the restaurant was NOT packed at all. Besides us, there were maybe 10 people total in the place...if that. The server kept coming to us asking us if we were OK. We said ""yes"", my friend she ordered another glass of wine and he brought it. When he came back to ""check on us"", he said ""OK, you need to go"". HUH??? We wanted us to leave, my friend wasn't even done with her wine yet. The thing is, we were kinda wrapping things up, but then he came to us with that comment. I get if you wanted to make room for more people to sit because it was crazy packed in there, but IT WASN'T PACKED AT ALL.

On a stretch of Milwaukee Avenue where places like Xoco, Umami Burger, and Bongo Room all have 30+ minute waits at 1:30pm in the afternoon, I was able to walk right into Max's and get seated immediately. That was the first clue. The fried chicken is average at best. It's certainly no Parsons, or L&E, or Leghorn, or really just about any other restaurant that is competitively perfecting their fried chicken recipe. The greens came out dark, nearing the color brown, and did little to inspire my appetite.  Max N Cheese was also average. It says ""pork belly topping,"" but it was really just shredded pork. I'd have to say it was better than the chicken, so if I were forced to return, I'd get the mac over the fried chicken.  I found the McCormick brand salt & pepper grinders on the tables to be trashy yet hilarious. The concept is interesting -- a sports bar environment but with wine to possibly fend off ""the bros."" Still, I felt like I was in a Houston strip mall (of which there are far too many). I entered this place into my ""restaurant death pool.""

Because I've been to the Austin location and it was great, and to the Atlanta location literally the week it opened (but only had a few mimosas - no food) and the servers were super cool and reminded me about the Chicago location to come. Sooo.. brunch places are always super packed and honestly I figured nobody really knew about Max's. It's next to Bongo Room which is always nuts and yup, I was right... Max's was virtually empty. The good: The food is fantastic. My friend and I both ordered the fried egg sandwich. It wasn't a plain jane egg sandwich though... it had truffle aioli, bacon, 3 eggs, etc. Large and delicious. It also came with truffle chips which was just too much for me so I substituted (or so I thought because they sure did still charge me) for the jalapeno cheese grits. The grits were quite yummy too. Mimosas during brunch are only $5, so of course I had one or two or three. The odd (nothing was bad): I felt like Max's was having a brunch identity crisis. It was very bizarre because they TRIED to have a cartoon brunch theme... in a wine bar, upscale dining establishment. Ummm, do they want more kids in the bar? They had a variety of toys spread out on tables throughout the restaurant so the patrons could ""play"". Weird. They also had TVs on in the background with cartoons but no volume. The music playing classic rock or something like that. That doesn't go together AT ALL. And they also had a special brunch menu written in crayon, colorful, playful letters with gross sounding options like s'mores pancakes, PB&J something or other and stuff like that clearly catering to children. I didn't get it. I don't think they got it right at all either. And mind you, I had to ask the server all of this. I had NO IDEA what was going on. It wasn't apparent to me until I had it explained. That's a problem, no? This review is 4 weeks late from my visit so HOPEFULLY they realized the theme was weird and doesn't work and changed it! LOL.

However, it kind of has that ""chain"" vibe. Fairly generic with some fun art work thrown in sporadically. I don't really say that as a criticism but with ""dive"" in the name, some people might be expecting more personality from the décor.  Our waitress was adorable. She was bubbly, funny, and super helpful. She helped us hone in on the wine we wanted and talked through the menu very knowledgably.  The wine selection is extensive and there were lot of options of wines at varying prices.

Perfectly fried, drizzled in delicious honey, served on tiny little rolls of delight with lettuce, tomato, and a perfect pickle slice. I hated that we were splitting these bad boys! I wanted them all for myself.  We also ordered the mac and cheese with pork belly. So delicious. Flavorful, creamy, and the pork belly was perfectly done.  We ordered the Cheesy Garlic Bread, which our waitress told us was one of the most popular items. And I can see in other reviews it was well loved by others. I didn't enjoy it quite as much as everyone else. This loaf of crispy bread is topped with garlic butter, olives, heirloom tomatoes, and shredded short ribs. The short ribs were fantastic. The bread stayed crispy and held up nicely to the toppings. But my order was so garlicky (and I love garlic normally!) that I could barely eat it.  The food was delivered as ready. Everything came out SUPER fast and nearly all at once. So that didn't work out quite as well as I had hoped. When I go back again, I wouldn't order my items all at once so that I could extend the evening a bit more. It felt a little rushed.

Well, they are now open and the wait has been well worth it.  To start things off, I have been extremely impressed already by them. My friends and I have used them twice for dinners. We've done take-out, so I can't speak for the level of service. What I can speak to is the food, which is damn good. Between both dinners, the lot of us have been able to sample a lot of the menu. In some ways, it's hard to pick out specific things, but I'm going to do that anyway. The buffalo sliders are a massive win. Theres a lot of flavor packed into a small burger and you just want to gobble it up really fast(though it's probably best not to). I've also been nothing but impressed with the pulled pork stuffed peppers. I honestly don't know how someone didn't come up with this combo before. Well, if they did, i wasnt aware of it and now these things of beauty are in my life and they won't go away. There is basically no way I can do this review without mentioning the fried chicken. I fully support the many places that are doing fried chicken these days, and I completely support Max's fried chicken. The pueces have that graat crunch while also being really moist. That is always a perfect combination in my book. I'm glad Max's Wine Dive is now here and I really look forward to return visits(and actually spending time here instead of just doing takeout).

Yeah its a ""dive,"" but that's not why I went. This place is a bit of a chain in that it has a restaurant in a few other cities, namely Atlanta. Look, if you can serve chicken there and survive, you must have good chicken. My expectations are ridiculously low for Chicago; at a chicken joint, it's like you can do the Mac and cheese but nothing else. However, the Famous Southern Fried Chicken comes with a boneless breast, a thigh, and a leg, along with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The mashed potatoes weren't spectacular, but those greens, OMG. I'm so picky about greens that I usually won't eat them if they aren't from my family recipe, but this was damn good. Plus the chicken was kinda amazing, the kind where you were full a long time ago, but to leave anything on your plate would be criminal.

We ended up being charged the higher price, but after pointing it out they adjusted the bill. Worth noting in case the same happens to you--check your bill!

I enjoyed my $15 glass of Malbec, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. I'm still not quite sure what their MO is for the wine side of the business. Something about bringing you wine you've never heard of for a great price? I didn't get that. Also, many of the wines are on tap. Shouldn't those be really economical?

The wine and food was delicious.  Our whole table went with the Tempranillo, and for food I got the BLT salad and fries.  It was one of those menus where I had a hard time deciding because so many things sounded good. I would definitely come back for wine + food.  It's conveniently located close to the Damen stop on the blue line which will be helpful if you take advantage of the delicious wine selection here :)",0.9947,0.683,0.278,0.039,0.5703754578754578

The atmosphere is cool and very fitting for the wicker park crowd. We started off ordering wine and champagne and after she realized a bottle was a better deal we decided to go that route. Our waiter didnt charge us for the extra glass she first ordered, just the bottle (WIN). The cheesy garlic bread sounds boring but when it actually shows up, it does not disappoint. We went on to share the fried chicken and just add some extra pieces which worked out perfect because it was more food than we could handle. This is where my rating is held to a 4star over a 5... we waited quite a long time for our entree and then the runner brought out one chicken breast (our extra piece) and were still left waiting for the whole plate. Our waiter and manager were incredible at taking care of us after that starting with bringing us complimentary champagne and making sure that we were satisfied with everything else after the mishap. Also, I had high expectations for the chicken and was impressed but not overwhelmed. Incredibly juicy but the breading was not ""Texas-quality""",0.9919,0.797,0.186,0.017,0.5790079365079365

Our server was fantastic, extremely helpful, patient, and genuinely excited to explain things to us.  The wine by the glass is not cheap...for me, I prefer to spend less than $10 on a glass.  I can rarely tell the difference.  I opted for the house white, and it was pretty good. The food and service is the reason I gave this place a 5.  We ordered the fried brie, which was good, but I'm not sure I'd order again.  My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken sliders.  I cannot even put in to words how tasty those were.  I ordered the shrimp and grits, and inhaled it rather quickly. Apparently, the brunch is supposed to be great, and they are making slight changes to cater to patrons suggestions (for a chain restaurant, I think that is very impressive). We also noticed a deal for a picnic type meal (perfect for taking to Wicker Park and enjoying a nice day).  Apparently, for $40, this includes a bottle of wine or champagne, 8 piece fried chicken basket, their yummy cornbread, another side, and dessert.  To me, that sounds like an amazing deal and I hope they keep it going so I can try next time I'm around to enjoy it.",0.997,0.76,0.233,0.006,0.6131481481481481
2014-07-19,2.0,"My boyfriend and I are always game for checking out new restaurants so having seen online articles that this place was coming we decided to check it out for brunch.  When we walked in, I was surprised because the atmosphere was not at all what I expected for a 'wine dive.'  It had the nondescript look and atmosphere for a chain restaurant.  Restaurants in this neighborhood are usually good about having their own distinct personalities and vibes, but this felt like it would be more at home in a suburban mall. We decided to overlook the atmosphere and hope the wine selection and food menu would win us over.  We were told they'd open any bottle on the menu with a 2 glass commitment, but it wasn't clear to us from our waiter's description what that actually meant.  Would we pay for the whole bottle and get the remaining wine to go?  Would they charge us a by the glass or carafe price (not listed on the menu).  It was unclear so we opted for two by the glass selections - the house red for my boyfriend and a rose for me.  My boyfriend enjoyed his red, he thought it was nicely spicy.  My rose was just okay.  I was also stunned how expensive the wines were given, again, the dive in the name.  I was expecting value priced wines, but a lot of the wines were quite pricy.  (My $12 glass seemed a bit much for a dive.)  I also was disappointed in how the wines were set up.  No descriptions about the flavor profiles.  No options for wine flights.  Also for a wine bar, I thought the mimosa options were pretty slim.  Yes, you could opt for a carafe of a few different kinds of bubblies, but the only mixers were orange juice and grapefruit.  I expected more interesting options. For food, I had the Max & Cheese w/ Pork Belly and my boyfriend ordered one of the daily specials, the Scooby Stacks - which were described as graham cracker pancakes with chocolate and marshmallow.  Our food came out promptly and was good,  but not memorable.  The Max & Cheese sauce was a big glue-y for my taste and the pork belly was thinly shredded that you didn't really get that pork belly experience.  (It could just have easily been regular ol' shredded pork.)  Mostly it just tasted rich with a hint of truffle oil.  It was good, but no better than the Mac & Cheese I've had at sports bars like the Diag.  As for my boyfriend's dish, the pancakes themselves were mediocre - oddly shaped and not incredibly flavorful in their own right.  The chocolate and marshmallow cream on top definitely made that dish tasty, but not superior to other pancakes we've had in town. Overall, our experience was just okay.  I'm not sure we'd come back.  Since dining I've learned that this place is a chain that was founded in Texas in 2006 and I feel like that explains a lot. I feel like the concept they are going for was probably pretty unique in 2006, but doesn't feel that special today, especially since the concept seems a little confused and ill conceived.  Personally,  I don't see the point in visiting when there are so many tastier choices in the neighborhood with great value and better atmosphere.",0.9968,0.782,0.16,0.058,0.5577487603607006

We bought a bottle since there was going to be 4 of us. Once we were ready to be sat, she and the manager brought over the wine bottle and bucket to our table. Our table was a bar table even though regular tables looked available and we had reservations. I normally wouldn't mind but the table was small so the food we ordered didn't fit on the table and didn't get much help from the staff.  DO NOT MISS the stuffed pepper appetizer which was the best part of the meal. The mac 'n' cheese was average.  We came for the fried chicken so that is what we ordered. For those who are gluten-sensitive, they have a GF fried chicken which they cook in a separate fryer. We ordered regular and GF. They were both very crispy and juicy however they both were VERY salty (and I love salt). I couldn't taste much of the other seasonings.  If you order the fried chicken, I suggest you order without the accompaniments: mashed potatoes which were average and the collard greens were too sweet and overcooked.

My friend and I stopped in for dinner on a Monday night and we started with a refreshing (and very reasonably priced) bottle of sparkling Rosé followed by a whole bunch of food: Nacho Mama's Oysters - fried Gulf Coast oysters on wonton ""chips"" with garlic aioli, habanero salsa and cilantro: Love me some fried oysters! *Pulled Pork Stuffed Peppers - pulled pork and cotija stuffed, topped with chipotle aioli and cilantro chimichurri: Loved, very tasty! *Small order of the Max 'n Cheese - cavatappi pasta in a truffle cream sauce with provolone, Gruyère and Parmigiano-Reggiano. The sauce was pretty thick and I didn't get as much truffle flavor as I would've liked, but I'm still a fan. This would be the perfect bowl of comfort in the cold winter months! *Famous Southern Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes, collard greens, and chipotle honey. The fried chicken was very good, especially after a hearty dip in the chipotle honey. Sadly the mashed potatoes were very underwhelming but the greens were full of flavor and totally made up for them. *Fried Brie with raspberry-chipotle coulis and cilantro salad from their seasonal menu. It was So.Good. - an easy favorite for both of us! Think of it as one big fried mozzarella stick but with creamy brie inside and a sweet but spicy sauce beneath. I think this needs to find it's way to permanent menu status because I'll definitely be wanting more when I return. At this point we were stuffed (as usual) but I'm just not the person who says no to dessert. We had the pots de crème infused with basil, topped with a rhubarb compote, and served with homemade sugar cookies. I've seen a few desserts lately that include basil in the list of ingredients and that just never sounded appealing to me. Our server told us that this was the lighter of the two so we went for it despite my hesitation. I am so glad we did because this was delicious!

My friends had burgers which were $15 a piece and I had the fried egg sandwich which was also $15. Both were overpriced. The burgers looked great but more like a $10 or $12 burger. Nothing all that special. My fried egg swch had very good ingredients but was sort of too greasy. And def should not have been $15.

I don't care how dainty you are trying to be, or how piggish it makes you look- order a loaf of the stuff and DO NOT SHARE! Hoard it for yourself.  We also shared the fried chicken platter which was fabulous. I now understand why they are known for their fried chicken. Their chipotle honey was just divine and we sucked down 2 servings of that gooey goodness! I also enjoyed some champagne and found a new wine to love! BONUS! It's cool that you can walk right in and buy a bottle of wine- for sale at RETAIL PRICES! So after dinner, once you've discovered a new bottle of wine that you love, you can go home with a bottle of the juice of the Gods and pay the lower retail price. I really thought that was cool.

I felt like I could have asked any staff member for an additional drink, and they would have gladly helped out because all of the employees were very nice, excited, and energetic. A couple critiques: Some of the food was less than warm. Specifically the potatoes and the greens could have been served much hotter. That is something Max's should work on. Additionally, there is a note on the menu that items being shared would incur a $3 up charge. That just isn't going to work in this neighborhood. First off, it's an upscale bar, not a traditional restaurant (or at least that's how I felt about it). People are going to want to order table appetizers and share as they enjoy the various wine options. I would recommend Max's remove this sharing policy altogether. Although we were able to share our two meals and upfront told our waiter we would not be paying the up charge, even having that policy in writing was a turn off and communicated that Max's was possibly more interested in concrete rules than enhancing the customer experience.
