2016-06-29,5.0,"Really sad to see this place close. It was my favorite place in the neighborhood. Lots of people have implied that that the owner wasn't always full of sunshine and sweetness when they walked in. She's very direct, but very nice and funny and kind and has always been great to me.  In any case, what many people probably didn't realize is that she was running the whole show by herself. Baking everything by hand, with fresh materials from scratch. AND making the breakfast sandwiches. AND waiting on customers. AND cleaning the place. And, and, and, and. She did it all, a one woman show.  Her stuff was AMAZING. Truly, completely, utterly some of the best stuff you'd ever want to have. Many of us loved her stuff, and frequented her store.  Sadly, even with one employee (herself) and really fair and affordable prices, people still bypassed her shop to buy chemical-filled crap at a grocery store. It also didn't help that the city closes down Randolph Street at the drop of a hat.  We can talk a good game about ""supporting local businesses"" in the neighborhood, but a lot of unique local businesses in the West Loop are disappearing, and soon only trendy chains with deep pockets will be able to set up shop there, alongside the now-ubiquitous bars that overserve the sea of young executives and hipsters. (It's still Skid Row, y'all, just the clothes are a bit nicer and Uber picks up fares here.)

2013-08-13,4.0,"It was my birthday, so I went looking for a treat :) This place was a lil hard to find because what's around it also has big window writing, except others have a sign above the door. So look hard. Its not the typical bakery imho, as there is no big menu board on top. In fact if there is a line its a little annoying to see what's there because it's only displayed on the counter. I liked that everything (except drinks and cookies) was marked with a price. There was a teeny sign to ask about cakes... I did, but none were available. I got the ""pop tart"" which was great, but very crumbly. I also got some cookies--- really great-- mini ones with lots of flavors. I bet the pies here are amazing... everything seemed to be heavy in butter. (not a complaint!) The line is really slow, but (I'm guessing who was) Loretta seems friendly, and given the excitement of others in line, I think this place has a big following.",0.9583,0.844,0.124,0.033,0.5034722222222222

We stopped here after Porkchop and on our way to the Illini game.  The owner was extremely friendly so we bought a bag of cookies and two hand pies.  After the game, we were stuck in quite a long traffic line.  Cornmeal lime cookies made that line seem like nothing, what a fabulous cookie.   Later on while watching a movie we had the sour cherry hand pies and man where they ever good.  Tart with an excellent crust and they went well with the yogurt lemon bar we feasted on as well.  Both were moist and just slightly sweet, not that overpowering stickiness you find in many bakery goods. There are so many restaurants to try in this area but only one Loretta's.  Next time you are eating nearby stop here for a dessert to enjoy at home.  Don't be intimidated by the no parking, loading zone sign.  You can park there if you are going in the store in front of you.

The fruit pie pastry was fantastic; it had a perfect balance of sweetness and tartness in the fruits and filling, and the pie crust was quite soft and not overly flakey. The home-made pop tart was even better; it had a perfect ratio of crust to delicious filling. Their goods are baked fresh every day, and it shows in the high quality of their treats. Also, the friendly woman baking in the kitchen toward the back mentioned that they use locally grown fruit for their pastries, which is a plus!

2012-03-08,4.0,"I'm giving Loretta's 4 stars because their pastries and baked goods are really very delicious. That said, I'm not giving them 5 stars because of the mess-up they did to our order but I do realize that it's a new business and they still have the kinks to work out.  My husband and I walked in on Sat to get breakfast. We chose the blueberry pie, croissant roll, and quiche pie. We were told that the quiche would take a few more mins in the oven. We said we were fine with waiting. A few mins had passed, and then the owner of Loretta's came out and said the quiche was still not ready yet and it would take again another few mins. We were totally fine with waiting for freshly baked quiche on a snowy Sat morning. Our blueberry pie and croissant roll were already packed in the box and sitting on the counter-- we just had to wait for the quiche. We were standing around waiting idly when my husband and I decided to walk over to N&G Produce to get some groceries since there was no point in us just waiting idly at Loretta'sfor the quiche. We had specifically told the girls working at the counter that we would be back in a few mins. They even said sure and apologized for the wait. Some minutes passed and we returned to Loretta to pick up our quiche. The owner of Loretta started explaining to me that the girls at the counter had sold all the quiche that just came out of the oven to another customer. What? We had already paid for them. The owner apologized profusely and said that she had reminded the girls that my husband and I were waiting for those quiche, but the girls said that we had left and then sold our quiche to another customer.  The owner then admitted to me that the employees need to communicate better. A new batch of quiche was in the oven, and the owner asked if we mind waiting again. We had already paid, so what could we do but just wait. The owner promised that the quiche would be delicious. How could the girls at the counter think we weren't going to come back when we still had our blueberry pie and croissant roll sitting on the counter? And we also had already paid. In addition, we told the girls we were coming back a few mins later to pick them up.  Honestly speaking, if it wasn't for how the owner of Loretta's handled this situation, we would be unhappy. Waiting again, this time my husband and I sat idly on the chairs. After awhile, the owner of Loretta's came over and sat down with us and apologized again to us. She again admitted that they need to communicate better and she is still trying to train the new hires. Later, she asked one of the staff to let us sample a dulce de leche shortbread and then gave us an extra quiche for the inconvenience this whole thing caused my husband and I. We truly appreciated how the owner tried to make better the situation and communicating with us the situation and admitting where they went wrong. We understand it is a new business and truly believe that once all the kinks are worked out, Loretta's has true potential to be a really great 5-star local bakery in the neighborhood. That said, the blueberry pie was very delicious and we loved the flaky crust. Luckily the quiche that we waited forever for was very good as well. We liked that it was more of a souffle quiche then one of those flat and dense quiche pieces.",0.9979,0.832,0.144,0.024,0.4553248393021121
2012-02-27,4.0,"I can't justify giving Loretta's five stars after just one visit, but suffice it to say they're on their way to earning it. After a particularly debaucherous evening with an old friend I hadn't seen in twenty years, I had to make a visit to her home Saturday morning in the west Loop to retrieve my phone that I had left in her car. On my way back, I spied this adorable little bake shop. I recalled coming across a review of them on my feed last week and made a mental bookmark. It's a bright, cheery little place that aims to please. Upon first glance, their offerings didn't seem to be that substantial, but what they did have was so good that I'll definitely be back for more. Lots more. I picked out a mini apple pie and one each of the cherry and blueberry hand pies. I was asked if I minded waiting a few minutes as the hand pies were just about to come out of the oven. For something fresh out of the oven, I don't mind waiting at all. My items were packed up in an adorable reusable tote bag which I think is a great touch. The box that the hand pies were in was still warm. Let's just say that only the cherry hand pie made it home. The smell was just too compelling for me not to dig in immediately, not to mention the hand pies are instantly portable. You can drive with one hand while holding the hand pie in your other! It was so warm, delicious and flaky, with sweet and tart blueberries in a lightly sugared crust. A most perfect little nosh. The cherry hand pie was great as well and the apple pie was just finished this morning with my coffee. Who says you can't have dessert with (or as) breakfast? I tell you what - the crust on that apple pie was in my top three of all time. And I love that the apples were still lightly crisp. All too often they're mushy if the right apples aren't used. Loretta's is a great addition to the west Loop and it's about time this neighborhood had its own little bake shop. Other items I spied were cookies, cupcakes, brownies, and cinnamon buns.
