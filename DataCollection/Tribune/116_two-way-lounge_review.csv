There are usually a good amount of very intoxicated people at this bar, at any time of day. These people can be very loud and rude, although most stay to themselves. Sometimes there are very sketchy people at this bar, and as some reviews have said, they might be gang members. The bartenders are not very nice or attentive. The hipster die-hards go here on the weekends.  They do have TVs for sports games, though, and dirt cheap beer, so it's ok once in a while, but definitely will not miss this place when it closes, even if it's taken over by an overpriced ramen joint.",-0.2849,0.85,0.064,0.086,0.6284023668639053

Monday and Thursday are dollar draft beer days so that's when you'll see me there. Let's see, I've come here alone, with my friends, with my boss, I've even brought my mother. Bringing the mom was stretching it, but hey.. she had a good time defeating the pool table.  Most of the people are everyday regulars and have been going for years.. hey Alfredo, Mike, Rick, Gloria and others! B and Amanda are the bartenders, who are completely awesome and respected. Shawn is the...bouncer? He's a sweet guy, you'll see him dozin by the door with a do-rag on. The Miller's own the place, they come into my place of work, Thread's etc, and buy funny things probably once a week. We do a lot of trading money back and forth. Sometimes they bring Shawn along with them.  It's really as unpretentious as it gets. Sometimes it's rowdy in there and can be filled with drama but mostly everyone's just trying to get their drink on. Besides, when there is drama it's entertaining... unless you're involved. Which just might happen, it's an unpredictable place! There's one pool table, a jukebox and plenty of seating. There are literally two ways of entrance, the name is just too clever Miller's. Also, I want the painting in the girls bathroom. I laugh every time I go in there.  If you want to dance and meet a soul mate, it's not the place for you but if you want to get wasted and have some good stories the next day join the party.  Just make sure to tip Amanda and Ms B!

One dollar for an Old Style on Mondays and Thursdays, and pitchers are six dollars every day. I can't think of too many other bars in the area that even sell pitchers.  There are signs advertising ""Jameson shots $3, 24/7."" It took this to mean that they were only three dollars twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. You can imagine my disappointment when I returned at 5am to learn the bar was closed, and Jameson was not available at any price.

2009-09-11,4.0,"Part dive, part hipster haven The first time I arrived here my friend told me two things: (1) this place is cheap and (2) the hipsters start rolling in around 11-12. Two Way gets its name because there are ""two ways"" of entering the bar - off Milwaukee and off Fullerton. Personally, I think the Fullerton entrance seems a bit dodgy.  The Two Way is nothing fancy, but then again it wouldn't be a dive bar if it was. It, of course, has one of the key staples of a dive bar - wood paneled walls, for that must-have basement feel. They also have a pool table, dart board, and a few booths and tables. The jukebox rocks, it's the kind where you can get almost any song. However, for a dive bar it seems very well kempt, particularly the ladies room, and well lit.  If you don't like Old Style this may not be your place. All drinks are cheap, but Old Style drafts in a frosty mug for $1 can't be beat! It's great leaving a bar buzzed and realizing you managed to spend under $10 to get that way! They have other kinds of beer, but for $1 Old Style is the bees knees and anything else is dead to me. Back to my friend's second point, ""the hipsters arrive between 11-12."" That couldn't be more spot on; during my first visit I noticed that it was 11:45 and as if on cue the door opened and a steady stream of hipsters started filing in. It was comedic, like a coach bus of them pulled up out front or something, there had to be at least 20 who came in all at once. I would've guessed they were part of some type of bar crawl, but I don't see bar crawls being very hipster-ish. While I've only been here a few times, I've always enjoyed myself. Cheap drinks, laid back atmosphere and a convenient bus trip from my house (#74 w00t) are a just few things Two Way's got going for it. It's also on the tamale guys hit list, which doesn't hurt either. Just bring cash, they don't take plastic.

It's SO cheap- $6 pitchers every day I think and Mon. and Thurs. dollar Old Style drafts. What I really like is how there will be a mixture of Logan Square hipsters, old alcoholic men, panhandling guys in motorized wheelchairs, haggard bike broads and their husbands, and other neighborhood locals. I have been to enough bars packed with bicycling, vegan, twenty-something drunk fucks that i really appreciate getting wasted with old creeps because it reminds me of home.  Sometimes it's hard to get a drink if it's really busy but you can keep yourself occupied by falling in booths with weirdos, picking overpriced songs on the juke box, smoking up by the back doorway (there are two, hence the name), or watching people play pool. Once i was approached for sex by a man dancing to ""Lolipop"" by Lil Wayne who sat in my booth and showed me his recently stitched stab wound. The best experience I have ever had is when I came on my birthday and a regular who goes but multiple names approached me in the doorway and immediately bought me a shot. Once they found out it was my birthday everyone the free liquor kept flowing from customers. The owner, Mike (who wears Harley Davidson tank tops and looks like a more tan Burt Reynolds) gave me root beer and whiskey floats on the house. We put Michael Jackson on the jukebox and thirty people were dancing in the aisle between bars and tables. I was blacking out between dance offs and being given piggy back rides, but I swear I felt a true sense of unity... Last time we came in here I brought a birthday cake for a friend and everything was playing out like usual, but one of the aforementioned bike broads picked a fight with my best friend (because her friend's husband had been talking to us.) There is obvious tension between hipster & veteran drunk, but this was alleviated when the security guard (who I love) stepped in. He assured us we did nothing wrong and said we were always welcome and could stay to drink with him after the bar closed. We dipped out, but I like to think that this was some kind of initiation and we will be cool with everyone next time.

One chic got me to buy her a long island iced tea. I think I gave her  $13.00.

Instead, I saw our pal who initially greeted us when we first entered and ordered old style on tap. He went on to tell us the saga of his life, including a break-up.  Then I saw the 2 weird guys I was staring at and laughing at the whistler. Ends up, they're from the UK and gave me interesting advice about british schools I am applying to for a masters.

It also has a super long bar, which can easy seat you and a dozen friends side by side. However, it's also home to some of the least attractive people I've ever seen.  Now, I don't want every bar patron to look like a supermodel. I appreciate old people, fat people, bad haircuts and the like. But I don't care for people who look like they've done something horrible in the past 24 hours. There were quite a few last night.

The beer is cheap and plentiful, the whiskey is cheap and plentiful. Sports are always on the televisions, strange things are always coming out of the (digital, internet) jukebox. Often, we get a few rounds on the house (spider in the glass, you know how it goes). I always leave drunk, and I always have fun. No better bar for me, kittens.

On one side of the bar sit the old regulars laughing heartily with gap-toothed grins, pool stick in hand, yelling at anyone that'll listen.

I have yet to leave this place without a huge smile on my face. I think the appeal is the cornucopia of people. There are some nights you walk into the tavern nearest a coal mine.
