2016-05-21,1.0,"SPOILER ALERT: The food is gross and staff is unprofessional so don't waste your time. My friend and I visited Pizza House on today (05/21) after exploring the 606 Path so we were both starving. I excited to try this place out because the pizza looked delicious when I walked pass the window.  The decor of the place is cool and the outdoor sitting area is beautiful. There weren't many people in the place so we got our pick of places to sit. After our waitress visited our table for the initial drink delivery she disappeared for awhile. She had to be reminded to take our order by the manager.  I obviously ordered pizza and my friend ordered chicken fingers with fries. My friend and I were chatting until we realized it had been a little over 25 mins since our waitress had stopped by to check in with us. Our food hadn't arrived yet so we were where the heck it was. I stopped a waitress that served the table that just arrived less than 10 mins ago their pizza. I asked about the pizza since we should've gotten our pizza. I was told for the first time that it takes 30 to 45 mins for the pizza to cook.  There was no mention of this little fun fact on the menu and not from our server. I was instantly upset because we wasted so much time waiting for her to come back to us that I would've ordered the pizza right when I got there. Our waitress had the nerve to come back to us saying she thought she mentioned it took 45 mins to cook. I was done after that and decided to pray that the pizza was worth the wait. When it finally reached our table in 35+ mins I knew from the look of the pizza it was going to be bad. I have never tasted sauce that was so flavorless. The crust was so hard I could've held the door open with just the tiny corner slice. It was not worth the slice and oh so gross. My friend said the chicken fingers were good but the fries were gross. They were oily and the seasoning was not evenly distributed.  The waitress was friendly but you could tell that she was slightly overwhelmed from the very moment we sat down. The manager had to consistently remind her where to sit people and to take orders. At one point the second waitress working mouthed the words ""I f-ing hate her"" to the manager while she was out in the open near the customers. A cook every gave her feedback about needing to do better in front of customers. It was not professional of him and made us uncomfortable since he came out of nowhere to give her that feedback. The staff cared more about serving the manager's daughter and gossiping about the terrible waitress then serving the customers even when we expressed that we were not happy. The waitress took our cards to split the check but forgot to ask which card was which and had to come back.  Please do not waste your time at this place. The food is gross, wait staff is slow and the staff is unprofessional.",-0.8841,0.824,0.082,0.094,0.4140445066915655

Our last order was over 90 minutes late, we ordered at 6:09pm and were told it would take one hour so we assumed about 7:10pm.  Delivery actually occurred at 8:39pm.  We had to call them twice and on both calls they lied to us over and over again.  The first call at 7:30pm they told us they were 20 minutes away from delivering our pizza.  Then again when I called just after 8pm they said they were ""just down the street"". Our order before that looked like it was literally lit on fire then thrown in a box.  I am not sure how someone could look at the pizza made and even consider it could be sent out to a paying customer, but someone did. In the end, we used to love this place but it is falling apart and I am not sure why.  My suggestion here for the business would be to just be upfront and honest.  Tell us delivery will take two and half hours upfront so we know what to expect, call us and say ""sorry we burned your pizza we are going to be 15 minutes late while we make you a new one""; they are both simple concepts that Pizza House failed to do and because of that I likely will not return.",0.8572,0.854,0.085,0.06,0.5391809248952106

I told her that everything was 20 minutes late and we'd been waiting in the restaurant for as long. ""Well, that's your order,"" she said. No explanation, and definitely no apology.  The reason it was late has to have been that nobody has started cooking the pizza, because the garlic bread was lukewarm and almost seemed stale, and the onion rings weren't hot. The pizza was hot and very good, though, which is the entire reason for the three stars.

The double dough looks more like Chicago and so I've yet to try it and probably will not. With that being said this is tied with Santullo's as my favorite pie, each for different occasions. I never dine in as the restaurant confuses and plays AWFUL music. The confusion is that it's setup like a take-out shop but has an outdoor patio alongside Cortland's Garage, and table and high top seating inside. It seems you can come in, be seated and order food and beer like a restaurant. This place doesn't give that vibe and so I assume service would be confusing, as another reviewer indicated. The music is some Italian pop or folk, I'm not certain. I get their desire for authenticity but please, pay a DJ to make a playlist. It's unbearable. The pizza is amazing! It's got a corn meal base in the dough I believe which makes for a nice and crispy crust. If you're like me and don't care for deep dish, you'll love this. I've had most of their toppings so far and have only been displeased with the bacon. I found it a little undercooked for my tastes. I like mine crispy. Otherwise all other ingredients I've had we're fresh and tasty. Aside from the music and confusing dining layout my only other complaint is value to dollar. Fountain drinks are $2.50, French fries are $4.75 and toppings are an additional $.75/1/1.25. That just seems excessive to me. How can garlic and Italian sausage be the same price? Is the amount of fries equivalent to Five Guys? Is that a liter of Sprite? I realize this is Bucktown but these just seem off to me. The staff is very friendly and the guy that makes the pizza always goes out of his way to engage all the customers. I will branch out and try some salads and sandwiches to enhance this review. I firmly believe this is the type of establishment that looks for positive and constructive criticism and will identify any known improvements. You're gonna love this pizza!

2013-06-25,2.0,"First off, it takes a lot for me to write a review on Yelp. The food was decent, have definitely had better Sicilian pizza within the city. A positive was the homemade sauce and sausages. The reason this restaurant is only getting 2 stars from me is because of their service. Our waitress was a sweetheart. Very warm, knowledgeable about the menu.  The issue was when we got the bill (I was dining with 4 girlfriends-3 in the service industry) we gave her cash to cover the bill and then asked for $20 on 1 debit card to leave her a larger tip due to her attentive service. I completely understand errors that occur when splitting a check on a bunch of different cards (I myself spent years in the industry and know this frustration)....but this was 1 card and the cash was given at the same time. The debit card was charged for the entire bill plus the $20 extra. When I called to speak with the manager the FIRST time regarding this issue I was told it would be taken care of within 24-48 hours. However, after 4 days I had to call again because the charge was still showing up on the account.  The second time I spoke with the manager she dismissed me and replied that it was a ""human error, I don't know what else to tell you. I was standing right there when it happened, I saw her void it."" Which in response I asked her why she had not told the CUSTOMER that the error occurred immediately if she was ""standing right there when the server made the mistake"". I understand mistakes happen...but I don't believe in putting your servers down by saying ""they just don't think"". Needless to say I was told she would check into it ""today or tomorrow"". No further customer service was initiated by management. A $20 mistake is one thing, an almost $90 error is another. My suggestion for Pizza House 1647 is to start treating their servers with respect, and remembering the golden rule of the service industry: even if you are CLEARLY annoyed with me, I'm the customer and I am right.  Especially when the mistake was supposedly witnessed by you and your employee. Bring cash if you decide to go.",0.5496,0.869,0.065,0.066,0.5064221294578439

2013-05-18,2.0,"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars but ultimately decided on 2 because of the following:  Food = 3.5 stars Service = 2 stars Atmosphere = 2.5 stars Sangria = 0 stars Value = 3.5 stars The decor is cool, and I wanted to love it. I want it to do well. That being said, I need to figure out how to give businesses my opinion before they open to tell them what's not a good idea.  We had to ask for water, and wait awhile for it. We saw our server pour water from a self-serve looking tap in the middle of the dining room into a plastic cup. When I needed more, I wasn't sure if I should get up and get it myself or if our server would refill it. Considering she was flighty, I figured it was a self serve deal but gave her the benefit of the doubt and waited to see if she would notice, which she did.  The kitchen staff appeared to be chatting rather then cooking, there were random laminated table numbers on each table, which seemed odd in a sit down restaurant, and the wait for the pizza was a bit long.  Also- I think it's a great idea to offer pizza by the slice, however after seeing the pizza to choose from, I wouldn't eat it. It looked like it had been sitting for a long time. In the hour and a half I was there, not 1 person got it. I'm assuming they heat it up when you order it, reminiscent of Sbarro. That is enough to turn me off from ever ordering it.  We started with sangria. It was undrinkable. The most disgusting excuse for sangria I've ever tasted. Imagine jug wine with a pound of sugar in it. I shivered when I tasted it. It was sickening. I thought about sending it back but the place is new and I felt bad, plus I'm not sure how it would have been received given it was ""highly recommended"" by our server.  Service was slow and for the most part inattentive.  Food was actually very good. We started with the escarole salad which was very fresh and tasty. We ordered 2 medium pizzas- 1 thin crust with artichokes and bacon, and 1 double crust with pepperoni and onion. I preferred the thin crust, my husband the thick crust. The crusts were very flavorful and it was well executed. Except we couldn't taste the pepperoni. Not at all. Not sure if there wasn't enough of it, it was too thin, or just not high quality but it was like it wasn't even there. The other pizza had a lot of bacon and was really good.  Between the service, the quirks that made it quasi- fast food casual, and the God-awful sangria, I probably won't ever dine in again. I do think we would order take out from here but only to switch up our established rotation of Piece, Coalfire and Roots.",0.5925,0.836,0.087,0.077,0.5493355780022449

Walked in yesterday on an unseasonably warm april day in chicago (84 and sunny) All the tables near the open door were filled. We were told to sit all the way in the back at the only available four top and come back when were ready to order, no hello...no welcome.  It was stifling back there (right next to the ovens) but by the time we decided what to eat one of the four tops by the door had gotten up. We asked if we could have the table and were told to wait. Um ok... We ordered, the table was cleared and were grudgingly given chilled glasses for our BYOB. No one was nice, the atmosphere was awkward particularly the older woman (hostess? owner?) at the front who was flat out rude. We ordered the panzanella bread salad (A steal at $4.95) it came out very quick and was easily shared between two of us. It was pretty flavorful but too much vinegar made some of the salad inedible.  then we waited..... for over 30 mins.... the two pizzas finally arrived piping hot from the oven, We got both 12 inch double dough, one chesse and sausage one veggie (green peppers, mushroom, olives)  They were ok. The sausage was better than the veggie, mostly bc it had more sauce and it was clearly housemade sausage. The veggie was basically dough, cheese and toppings. The sauce was pretty great but I want more, much more!   Verdict: never again, nice try though.",0.9935,0.752,0.204,0.044,0.5653950216450218
2013-04-15,4.0,"After hearing that a new pizza restaurant opened up in the Cortland corridor, we had to try it immediately! They specialize in Sicilian style pizza, which is not to be confused with deep dish. We ordered a 12'' thick crust with sausage, green peppers and giardiniera. It was excellent! The pizza is made with a whole-wheat, cornmeal crust and prepared with minimal tomato sauce. In fact, the sauce is very light and is actually diced tomatos, not tomato sauce or paste. The homemade sausage was flavorful and a must-order topping. The use of cheese is also on the lighter side. The focus here is definitely the dough and it is certainly a departure from the myriad cheese heavy deep dish pizza found everywhere in the city. We really enjoyed it and welcome the new style available here in Bucktown.  We also ordered the thin crust. I was a bit disappointed in the thin crust. For me, thin crust should be neopolitan style and Sicilian is more of a thick crust. I think the thin crust is on the menu as a healthy option. What really blew our minds was the salad. We ordered both the chopped and pazanella salads and they were awesome. They were both larger than expected, and the greens were uber fresh. What made them really stand out was the homemade dressing. I couldn't stop eating the panzanella, and the homemade whole-wheat croutons were fantastic! At $16 for a three-topping thick crust, I thought the prices were pretty reasonable.  The ambiance is very casual and simple, but I do like places with the wood-fired ovens open to the dining area.  From what I've read, the owner of Club Lucky (Bobby Paladino) is behind this restaurant, and although we're not big fans of Club Lucky, we did love the food here at Pizza House.

The place was about half full at 8 PM, leaving many high and low tops to choose from. We decided to take a seat in the back at a high top so we could be in full view of the pizza making madness. Their massive red, rotating pizza oven is definitely something to check out. We ordered a new a salad off the menu, which had whole wheat croutons, endives, red onion and more. It was fantastic! Also, it was a good hold-over as the pizza takes 30-45 minutes to cook depending on the crust you choose (thin or double). We decided to go with a thin 12' pizza with homemade turkey sausage, mushrooms and green bell pepper. The crust was the best part.
