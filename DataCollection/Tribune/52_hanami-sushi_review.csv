That earned them a star, they always have tables available--another star, and it's BYOB -- 3rd star.  We have gone here twice now.

There is a kind of interesting odor in the restaurant...smells kind of old and musty. I tried not to let it get the best of me since I wasn't staying. The place was totally empty.  The food: I had the Philly Maki and Tempura Maki, out of all the sushi I've ever had this was nothing spectacular. It's your average sushi with minimal taste. Two of my rolls in the tempura were empty inside! No avocado and barely any rice. I got Miso soup for free from the lady working, also very bland. The soy source is absolutely horrendous, it's very sour. This is probably the one and only time I'll eat from this place again.

First of all there's barely any rice and it's not even sticky rice that usually comes with chirashi/salmon don bowls. Usually a salmon don bowl would fill me up- but not from here. Also, my salmon was browning and does not look like sashimi grade fish. I also got two orders of the tonkotsu ramen and they only delivered ONE. I haven't tried the rest of the sushi I ordered yet, but I'm hoping their other cuts of fish will be more fresh. Will not be ordering anything consisting of salmon from here ever again.

Well, Hanami Sushi got half of it right. We came to celebrate a special occasion in a person's life, and the event itself was spectacular. Good company. Good venue. BYOB! Of course we brought some good wine to share amongst each other to celebrate. When it comes down to the food and service though, I would say that I've had better. I ordered the Crunchy Spicy Tuna Roll ($7) and a Salmon Maki ($5). Prices are lower compared to other sushi places, but so are the portions. From the two rolls I ordered, I wish I had ordered ramen instead because it was surprising how small the Salmon Maki was. The spicy tuna was good, but the salmon had barely any taste. I was missing that fishy taste that I adore so much. Service was a bit on the slow side, but that's to be expected with so many people to cater. They were very generous in allowing us to split the bill as we'd like, so i appreciate the management for allowing us to do so.

2015-12-01,1.0,"Worst sushi of my life.   The whole experience was bizarre.  We arrived and there was no one there so we thought it would be a nice quiet evening.   We were hurried the entire time (the waiter kept coming up to the table to move it along).  He came to our table 2 minutes after arriving asking for the appetizer order. We were in and out in under an hour.  Then when I checked in using the yelp app I was supposed to get a free lec green tea but they didn't have any green tea left.  So My husband said he'd take the substitute; they told us the substitute had an up-charge.  Um, ok? Isn't the point of a substitute to be in place of the missing item?  Either way, the black tea was subpar, at best. The rolls were not as tight as they need to be, look I get it, all apprentices need to begin somewhere but come on, I couldn't even use the chop sticks because it kept falling apart. The spicy salmon roll was the worst I've ever had (and I've bought sushi from walgreens).  The salmon was such bad quality we couldn't even finish it; it was pink (like the crayon) and the texture was soggy as if though it had been left out all day.  The other three rolls were meh.   I wouldn't go back based on the poor service and the bad quality ingredients.",-0.9521,0.834,0.048,0.118,0.45982142857142855

I enjoyed drinking the miso soup that they have me right away so when I was done eating the sushi I could finish with a nice arm cup of soup and not scorching hot. They have a lunch special that offers 3 rolls for $14 and it comes with the miso. All 3 rolls that I had were delicious. The were able to substitute the avocado out and add shrimp since I have avocado allergies without charging me extra.

2015-11-01,1.0,"We ordered delivery from here expecting a feast and was sadly disappointed. We ordered the Tuna Don, Tonkotsu Ramen, Maki Dinner (30 pieces), Unagi Roll, Crunchy Spicy Tuna Maki (8 pcs), Beef Negi Maki. We were expecting to eat only part of it and save the rest for lunch the next day. But first, all the food came delivered in those tiny plastic, rectangular trays like grocery store sushi. This wouldn't be a problem except they JAM PACKED way more sushi in those containers than necessary. Probably around 15 pieces in each tray. As a result, the sushi was in a disappointing, unrecognizable squished up mess from being smushed into the packaging. The tuna don which is a rice bowl dish ALSO came in the same flat tray as the sushi did. It was such a tiny portion and there was nothing special about the taste. The ramen was probably the only decent thing from what we ordered, but it still wasn't something that stood out from other ramen I've had. We bought a lot off the menu, but it didn't satisfy two people much less have enough left over for lunch the next day. We ended up having to snack on something else. We've ordered half the amount of food from the sushi place nearer to us on Lawrence and have been more full. From the other reviews, I was surprised by how disappointing our experience was.

The prices are very affordable, they even have specials.  We started off with some seaweed and squid salad.  Pretty standard, nothing spectacular, tastes like every seaweed squid salad I've had in the past.  We also got some vegetable tempura.. again pretty straight forward.  For our main entree, Wifey went with some maki, a spicy crunchy salmon and a salmon avocado.  They are a little skimpy on the fish, you could barely see any fish.  I went with the Tonkatsu Ramen it was on special.  It was a very generous bowl and it was actually very tasty!  I was pleasantly surprised, I was actually not expecting much as I have had some very disappointing ramen at a few places.  The broth was good, the pork was flavorful.. the only criticism I guess would be that the noodles were all balled up and still a bit chewy, they seperated after a while and got a little softer, but the noodles could be better. We enjoyed our meal with wine and beer and went on our merry way... it was good.. nothing spectacular, but, i think would be back for a nice bowl of ramen with a few beers, probably not the sushi or maki.",0.9833,0.842,0.133,0.024,0.5201335656213705

2013-05-24,2.0,"I came here alone spontaneously after my date for the night postponed our rendezvous (say what?! I know, right?!) because the Groupon redeemed notification is just as big of a thrill. I walked in and there were two people there, who then left, making me the only person in the entire restaurant. Awkward. First of all, there are two websites for this restaurant and two different online menus. I was looking at the fancier site and the wrong menu. I thought I knew what I wanted walking in, but instead had to read all the roll descriptions on the spot (stress!) and ordered some gyoza to give the staff something to do in the meantime. The server, by the way, was the cutest thing ever, saying ""excuse me"" every time she timidly approached. I decided on the crunchy shrimp roll and the hanami roll because I usually love any maki with shrimp tempura, eel, and avocado in it. After what seemed like a long wait, the gyoza came out, with the maki coming out right after. Ugh. I really wanted some time between the app and the rolls, but ok. I'll just take my time. 6 gyoza! They were tasty and perfectly toasted. Absolute enjoyment and I ate all 6 even though I knew I should have saved more room for the enormous rolls sitting in front of me. The hanami roll came in 10 pieces and the crunchy shrimp was in 8 pieces (if I remember which was which). The crunchy shrimp was not crunchy. The hanami was, because of the cucumber. Soggy tempura? Sad. Considering my history of maki eating, I should have known better than to order rolls with cream cheese, and unfortunately, both of these had it, but usually it's not so overwhelming and it works to tie the roll together. In this case, all that was left in my mouth was cream cheese- I actually had to clear my mouth of the gooey substance between each roll. The flavors of what I was eating never came through and if not for my wasabi infused soy sauce, I think I would have been eating particularly bland food. I ate more of the rolls than I wanted because I was shy to leave so much on the plate being the only person in the restaurant. At some point the waitress lit all the candles, which seemed like a waste of wax, and at another point a party of two walked in. They had an 'any 3 rolls for $30' special, but I'm glad I didn't waste the calories.

""I do warn you, every time I walk by there, it's either closed or no one is in there."" Whatever, we weren't desperate for food; we both were just lazy to cook. Sure enough, when we arrived there was not a soul in the place. We got seated and proceeded to order. The menu is pretty standard for a sushi place: various soups, rolls, and maki. She ended up ordering the California & sweet potato roll; I tried two of the sea scallops roll (cause I'm a fan of scallops). Supplemented the order with a large ramen bowl. The rolls that we ordered came out to be just the right size. Both of us tasted pieces of each other's order; I liked her rolls better than mine! The soup was tasty; overall the dinner just was filling enough. I was disappointed because in one of the earlier reviews they said that they got free edamame with their dinner; but we still received free mochi for dessert. Sweet!

A little odd, but it could be worse.  I had the seaweed salad. Very yummy. My friend had the cucumber salad and it was like nothing I've ever seen.

2013-02-18,5.0,"Perfect for date night, exceptional sashimi (BYOB) Hanami Sushi is a very welcome new addition to North Center's quickly growing options for excellent dining. The atmosphere is intimate, the artwork appealing and relaxing. There were not many people there on the Sunday night when we went (which I suspect will change as the word gets out), so it was perfect for a date. The service was very friendly and exceptionally good (which I guess is not surprising on a quiet night). Between the miso soup/seaweed salad and main dish, we were surprised with some warm, complimentary edamame that was, in my opinion, perfectly cooked. I'm a finicky sushi eater--I eat it without soy or wasabi--so the quality is essential for me. I asked what the freshest catch was, and I was treated to some very creamy salmon sashimi that had just come in. The super-white tuna was also very fresh, creamy, and buttery. The maki was also good--the Passion on Fire Maki was an excellent combination of flavors that I have never had before. It was slightly over-flavored, but the taste was appealing, so I didn't mind a little extra richness--definitely worth trying; I'll probably make it a regular order. The Mixer Maki was slightly less satisfying--it's a combination of spicy tuna and spicy salmon, covered with tuna and salmon sashimi. The top fish were fine, but the roll itself was neither flavored very well nor spicy, somewhat of a disappointment. This is probably a difficult issue for sushi chefs though, since most people immediately dunk it in soy with a ton of spicy wasabi--If I had done that (which I actually did for the third piece), it probably would have been fine. No real complaints though--I'm just splitting hairs. At the end of the night, we were again treated to a complimentary dish, this time mango and green tea ice cream balls. A very tasty end of the night. The restaurant is currently BYOB, which saves money--our entire bill for two was $43. If you forget alcohol, it's not a problem--just visit the new Bottles and Cans boutique wine and beer store 2 blocks north on Lincoln (I just discovered it today as well).

And waited.  None of our food arrived until at least 30 minutes after we ordered.  At least the sushi was decent, which was the only redeeming factor in our dining experience here.  We started with the Yellowtail Sunomo, which was good.  Then we waited for another 10-15 minutes until the rolls, nigiri, and hamachi kama arrived all together.  Initially, we were missing a pair of ebi shrimp nigiri, but the server said they were still preparing it.  I thought that was odd since I'm used to having all the sushi presented at the same time (or at least all the similar types of sushi in groups).  Seriously, how long does it take to make ebi nigiri?  The rolls were pretty good: we ordered the Spicy Crunchy Tuna and the Caterpillar.  The best was the hamachi kama, which was tender, fell right off the bone, and was not over salted. By the end of the meal, our meter had already expired, and so had both of our patience and tolerance.  At least the food was decent and the server remained enthusiastic, even when she was oblivious to what was going on.

2012-12-03,4.0,"I called for a delivery order and spoke with Sam.  I didn't have a menu, their website menu wasn't working, however, I did find them on GrubHub.  GH's menu was minimalist and Sam was most gracious in suggesting maki rolls based on my preferred tastes.   I ended up ordering salmon, mackerel and yellow-tail sashimi (two pcs per order) and one of their signature rolls, Passion on Fire. The sashimi slices were slightly larger than what I would expect on rice as nigiri, yet much smaller than I've been served elsewhere.  The salmon and yellowtail were as fresh tasting as could be. The mackerel was just a bit over-the-top preserved and tasted more like pickled herring. The Passion on Fire roll is described as shrimp tempura inside salmon, super white tuna on top, served with chef's special sauce with a sprinkle of tobiko and green onion. And to me, the shrimp was sweet and plump, the sauce and garnish combo was delicious, however, the salmon and superwhite tuna were mere shavings.  Overall, they fit together well in theory yet I would have enjoyed it more if the salmon and w.tuna pieces were thicker and distinct in flavor. 3.5 stars would have been 5 had I felt the portions matched the pricing.  I'm grateful that Sam included a comp order of edamame to fill the void for a more satisfying light  meal.  I bumped my rating up to 4 for great service and a speedy delivery.  I really want to give this place an ELEVEN...their unique menu is just one better than most, I'll give Hanami an in-house visit, with a Yelp or Groupon discount deal, to get the full experience of the house instead of a late night delivery and will post an update if there's a significant difference.",0.9931,0.811,0.173,0.015,0.5587698412698413

The appetizer crispy sake is amazing. It's very unique and tastes great! The Mixer Maki, spicy tuna and spicy salmon were all very good too - tasted fresh",0.9898,0.544,0.439,0.017,0.753
2012-11-18,5.0,"We finally were able to dine in at the restaurant last weekend.  Again, my husband and I were blown away with how good everything was.  We both agree now that Hanami makes the best sushi in Chicago.  (And we've eaten at a lot of sushi restaurants.)  Everything we ate was delicious, and we couldn't get enough.  They gave us free edamame and cucumber salad, which had their yummy tempura crumbs and special sauce on top.  We've never tasted a cucumber salad like that.  My husband doesn't even like cucumbers, and at first he didn't know that they were in there, but he loved it.  The only thing that bothered us about this place is that it was empty.  We could not figure out why no one was in there on a Saturday night when their food is SO good.  We're thinking it's because they're still a new restaurant.  Well, that's why I had to update my review, so more people will go there!  They need more business!  If you want fantastic sushi with amazing flavor that melts in your mouth, you must try Hanami.  We can't wait to go there again.",0.9859,0.763,0.201,0.037,0.6225487012987013

2012-09-06,4.0,"Delicious sushi place!  My server was very nice and polite.  Loved the complimentary edamame.  I got free miso soup for checking in with Yelp, which was tasty and a good portion.  Got the Chicago roll which was delicious and fresh. The environment is pleasant and the decor is fairly classy.  Would've given 5 stars but the rolls are on the pricy side for everyday, but I can't wait to go for a nice dinner again sometime!",0.9671,0.7,0.3,0.0,0.8055555555555555

2012-08-15,4.0,"Tasty sushi to enjoy with your favorite white wine at a reasonable price. Went to enjoy some sushi and split a bottle of wine with my sister one last time before I moved for a new job.  The decor was relaxing and attractive, and the service was attentive but not overbearing.  One nice touch is that the standard water has lemons soaked in it to give it a slight flavor. The cucumber salad we had for the appetizer was quite tasty, and all the tables came with complimentary edamame.  The Hanami and Lover's rolls tasted great, and one cutesy thing on the Lover's roll is that they make hearts on the top with the sauce.",0.9687,0.775,0.202,0.023,0.5291919191919192
2012-08-03,4.0,"While driving back home I saw a grand opening sign for sushi and that's all it took to visit Hanami on their second day of being open. So this place is where T Spot used to be and honestly I was surprised with the another sushi restaurant opening here considering Wasabi is pretty much across the street. Service: Well, I talked to Sam who I think is at least a partial owner of this restaurant and he was very cordial. Since it was only their second day open, I did get paid close attention to, especially sitting at the sushi bar.  Decor: It's nice... Pretty much your usual new, hip style look with the exposed brick wall and also the black painted walls. The chairs and tables were new (found out talking to Sam) and everything fits together. Of course, you can't just have good service without at least decent food... Things I got were: Cucumber salad: Given to me to try complimentary and it tasted fine. Pretty standard. Edamame: Given complementary. Same comment as the cucumber salad. It's edamame... Salmon and saba sashimi: The fish is fresh. The cuts were on the generous side. With the saba I got three small pieces for my order. The saba tasted like it was pickled differently than other places, but was good although served what seemed a little warmer than room temperature. Spicy scallop roll: It was fine. Not spicy... it tasted fine though. Red fire maki: One of Hanami's signature makis. It was pretty spicy. I thought it was a bit too sweet though with the sweet chili sauce. I would attribute this to the sushi chef drizzling the sauce straight from the bottle instead of like a squeeze bottle or something. I liked the fresh jalapeno on top as it is a nice touch. Strawberry mochi: Another complementary item for me. It was one strawberry mochi split into 4 pieces.  Overall, you can tell this a new place. I am giving Hanami a 4 (rounding up) as nothing was bad here. I actually enjoyed how I was treated and can see this place as a nice addition to the North Center neighborhood. Hanami definitely has the potential. I will definitely come back to try again and update.",0.9965,0.774,0.2,0.026,0.5259702286018075
