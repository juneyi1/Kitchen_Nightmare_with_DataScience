2016-04-19,3.0,"Newport is a neighborhood sports bar that is greater than the sum of its parts. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, and certainly not memorable. The appetizers are pretty tasty - standard fried bar food fare - but I wouldn't venture too far into the rest of the menu. Be sure to avoid the burgers in particular. The servers and bartenders are always kind, and the daily specials are usually quite good, but the beer isn't always cold. There are TVs totally encircling the place and they show every relevant sports game, which is remarkable especially on football Sundays.  In sum: the food isn't good, the beer isn't always cold, and the atmosphere is forgettable. However, the people are awesome, there's plenty of sports to go around, trivia is a particular highlight, and somehow it all comes together to result in a pretty charming neighborhood bar.",0.9923,0.73,0.254,0.016,0.6960648148148149

It was just bread with sugar on it, not baked or cooked or anything. The side of bacon we asked for very crispy, was greasy and floppy. It's very inconsistent. Their bloody mary was spicy, tasty and strong. The mimosa was as expected but both were priced well. The worst thing is that extra items were added to my bill and I had to ask to get them taken off.

Ordered the Mac and Cheese wedges which were pretty good.  Little bland but the dipping sauce made them even better.  Next time I go I need to try to The Wipeout.  I picked the Texan for my burger selection.  It's got a lot of spice to it so if spicy isn't your thing, don't order.  It comes with topped with chili, jalapeno peppers and a fried egg.  You can choose cajun or regular fries.  Probably should have ordered regular fries because between the spice on the burger and fries, my mouth was burning.  But it was delicious and plentiful.  I couldn't even finish it and had to take half of it home.

As an appetizer, we got the Mac and Cheese Wedges and and The Wipeout (with tots). We were considering putting in another order of Mac and Cheese Wedges because they went so fast.. and it was half priced apps at that time so it was very tempting. We wanted to save room for our burgers though, and I'm glad we did. The Wipeout was delicious, ate it with a fork since it was smothered with chili, cheddar-jack, tomatoes and onions. Despite being smothered, the tots were still crispy and not soggy. I got the Texan burger. It had chili, cheddar jack, peppers, and  a fried egg served on texas toast. There's really no easy way you could pick it up and eat it. Don't wear white and don't get this burger if you're trying to be a lady and impress someone. I ate mine by cutting off chunks and using a fork but everything about it was delicious and you get a huge amount of food for a cheap price. Shauna was our server and she was a doll. So sweet and attentive. There was an issue at one point with food taking too long or an order not being 100% correct.. to be honest I can't even remember because Shauna and the manager on duty were so great in handling it, it didn't even phase us. The manager offered us the skillet cookie to make whatever wrong we experienced right which was awesome of him. The skillet cookie was just as good as it sounds. I think you're supposed to wait to dig into the ice cream until it melts a little but we couldn't wait.. as stuffed as we were, we grabbed 4 spoons and started chipping away at the ice cream. The ice cream could have been softer but as I said, if we waited like 5 minutes I'm sure it would have been.

I have so many awesome memories of this place, and it's only getting better. We always graded our papers there on Saturday mornings and had a steady supply of diet coke, wings, and french fries.  The menu has continued to improve after the not-so-hot beach theme was dropped. They have fantastic burgers and awesome wings. This is pretty much the only place in the city where I can count on the wings to be big, delicious, and the perfect amount of spice. They JUST introduced a new one right before I moved away with soy sauce, Sriracha, and pineapple--SO delicious! I still pine for the days of the waffle fries, but their steak fries are great too. They also have great specials--especially for teachers! They really go above and beyond for us! Owner Adam and manager Scott have always been so kind to me and all of my friends, and bartenders Erin and Ali are always hilarious, fun, and quick with a joke and a sympathetic ear.

2013-02-27,2.0,"When I see a bar in Chicago rated 3.5 stars, I'm going to think it's at least a decent place to get some pub grub and beer. I went here with a friend before seeing a movie at the Music Box, and I was embarrassed to have invited her there.  The space is large and generic, with a lot of high tables with bar stools on one side, and lots of high tables with tall seats with backs (why this distinction? who knows??), and tons of big-screen TVs showing sports. It's not a dive, it's not a hipster bar, it's not contemporary, it's not old-school... it's just a room with tables and stools and TVs. The tables all look pretty cheap and the environment is boring. The jukebox is a TouchTunes that costs too much and has a generally bad selection, so even when someone ISN'T playing the latest top 40 crap you are listening to some truly terrible automated selections. It was EMPTY at 6pm, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it made it feel even lamer than it was. The server was attentive and nice enough. The menu is decent, with the expected fare from a bar, but they have a nice amount of stuff vegetarians can eat. Note that I won't say it's exciting vegetarian-focused food or anything, but they can at least eat something decent there. Tuesday specials included $5 quesadillas and $6 pitchers of Bud/Bud Light, so I ordered a chicken quesadilla, my friend got a cheese, and we split a pitcher of Bud and fried pickle spears. The pitcher was almost certainly Bud Light, not Bud, and even though we asked for the pickles to come out first they came at the same time as the quesadillas. The quesadillas were pretty damn boring, with a small amount of chicken chunks smattered in there. The salsa and sour cream did little to liven things up, and I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to get some flavor out of it. I couldn't imagine what my friend's cheese one was like. The pickles were pretty good, with a nice thick batter that didn't immediately slide off the pickles themselves - a rare feat. Long story short, I wouldn't ever go back to this place.

Service stunk and was lax with their attitude.  A couple of them were strutting their shit, obviously for the bigger cock filled tables to get better tips.  This left some confusion in which waitress handled which table.  I finally got fed up from hollering for service; so I placed a drink order at the bar.  Bartender asked who my server was; no fucking clue.  This prompted someone to get us served.  Thirty minutes before our first drink arrived, which included water.  Without thinking twice we placed the order for food in a heartbeat.  That took some additional time.  Shit you wonder is, who is in the back expediting orders and making sure the food is coming out in a timely manner versus are the waitstaff on top of their game.  Who knows. Pricing on food is decent, so we didn't spend an arm and a leg.  Depending on where your certificate was purchased from, the value is good on food and booze but also booze specials!  Regular pricing on booze such as cocktails wasn't the greatest.  To save a buck or two, I'd suggest hitting them up for their nightly liquor specials.  Additionally, they have a very decently priced brunch menu which sounds appetizing as well.   Food was okay.  We ordered a few appetizers and all got the filet Mignon sliders which are served on Hawaiian rolls.  Only 1 out of three received their sliders cooked to order.  The sliders and the quesadillas were the only memorables.  Quesadillas were hella bland and coming by hot sauce in here is a task.  By  default they use Tabasco but if you say Chohula, maybe the waitstaff may know where one is available.  We were less than impressed and it was noted to a waitress which prompted a quick response from a manager.  The manager felt our woes and offered us a comp on our next visit.  We were asked to return to try out a new tropical inspired menu which they hoped to release in the weeks to come with a much needed decor update to something more like what you'd find at a beach.  If this has happened yet, the photos on Yelp now, may be out dated. Strong points:  Inexpensive food menu.  Internet juke box.  I think they had darts and on weekends they have live music.  Earlier weekdays would be a better time to get to know this bar.",0.9759,0.832,0.106,0.062,0.5323685573685574

2009-10-18,4.0,"Apologies upfront, this review may not be helpful to MOST of you. However, it should be very helpful to the cooler segment of Chicago. And who might that be you ask?  Well, the local University of Michigan diehards of course. I'll be honest, I came here on Saturday on a word of mouth recommendation to catch a UM football game and for no other reason.  As you Chicago sports fans know, the bar scene changes for following collegiate athletics every year.  Currently, there are 7 bars that I PERSONALLY have been to that promote themselves as University of Michigan football watering holes.   1) Duffys 2) Mad River 3) Matilda 4) Moe's Cantina 5) Rockit Downtown/River North 6) Rockit Wrigleyville & of course, here, Newport Bar & Grill, what we are discussing here today.  Duffy's of course is the mother of all Michigan bars, but that caters to a crowd that is 21-24 years old. The days of waiting an hour in line to get into a bar to get a table before it opens are long gone.  God bless those of you who are in your prime right now, enjoy it!   The best part about Newport you ask?  It is truly a Michigan bar with the flags and music to boot, but it isn't forced and it's a crowd that spans a couple of generations with a laid back vibe.  You don't have to rush to get there, and you can crawl right out of bed to go, because the only talent in attendance were the wives and girlfriends of the other Wolverine fans who came along for support.  Not that I go for any reason other than the game, but at those other spots, you gotta pack your A-Game in your back pocket just in case a happy Michigan girl wants a little more than a High 5. (get your mind out of the gutter, I meant a phone number or your post game agenda)   I recommend this for any game in which avoiding seating headaches is a plus to you.  I'm a Take 5 Alumn, so this was a nice place to fill that void in my life now that they got shut down. Cheap drinks, cheap food, friendliest staff in the world, and the brunch is in-line with pure restaurants, which is rare for a dive like this.  It's a dive, but it's a dive that local residents and Michigan fans can call home. That's all that really matters, as every now and then we need a break from the fluff, Dog & Pony shows, bells & whistles. Go to Newport, and Go Blue!!!",0.9949,0.843,0.135,0.022,0.4292760356174991

You have to love this concept!  I didn't spend much time there as we were thirsty and only had time for one.  It seems to be a very laid back kind of place which gives it a thumbs up in my book!  They also had Heineken on special for $3/bottle today so they get more points too.",-0.7746,0.859,0.034,0.107,0.519047619047619
2006-04-20,4.0,"The Newport is a pretty funny place.  It's my local laundromat, and it's a bar.  Try to top drunk laundry!  They have tons of board games to pass the time on laundry day or anytime.  Each day there's a different beer special, even on weekends.  The food is pretty ridiculous (just huge platters of fried something), so I just stick to the beer.  Great place to watch a game.  The TVs aren't HD, but no matter where you sit you can see them.  Oh and if you're dressed to go to typical bars on Southport, it's really funny to come in here and watch the regulars' heads turn!",0.9333,0.785,0.186,0.03,0.7301020408163266
