2016-05-29,5.0,"Delicious with an amazing atmosphere. The food was plated beautifully. We tried the fish tacos (two small tacos served with rice and beans), the quesadillas (an appetizer but enough for a meal), the guacamole (some of the freshest and tastiest guacamole I have ever tried), the steak tacos (also served with rice and beans), and the enchiladas (also served with rice and beans). They were all so delicious. The ingredients tasted fresh, the portions were perfect, and again, the dishes were all played beautifully! For desert we tried the tres leche cake and the flan. They each came plated with strawberry detailing and were delicately delicious. Not too sweet but not too bland. We loved the BYOB aspect of this restaurant - no corking fee and they'll open the bottle and provide the glasses! The chef came out multiple times and spoke to the table, explaining ingredients and answering questions. Our sever was pleasant and attentive. I would recommend getting a reservation because it's very, very small. Not good for large groups. I'd say they max out at about 4 people per group. Overall, I will definitely be back - great food and fabulous atmosphere!",0.9974,0.688,0.301,0.011,0.6770238095238096

Everyone was happy and left satisfied, but not stuffed.  I assume it was Enrique himself who came to the table, and he was so hospitable, as was our waitress.  My only complaint is that the music was a little too loud to allow much conversation.  However, we were busy eating...  Next time I will get something with more spice, or at least ask for some hot sauce.  Anyway, this review is only for brunch, and we went to Rique's because the staff at Tweet were so rude to us.  The interior was nice and sunny and clean, and the attention to detail and authenticity makes me want to go back for dinner sometime.  A special thanks to the chef for accommodating vegetarians who love Mexican food!",0.9796,0.782,0.171,0.046,0.5387557603686636

Both were just too chewy and really rough, not to mention again tiny portions. I think Mas Alla Del Sol puts their food to shame up the street. They get three stars instead of two because the owner came out and was really friendly and clearly cared that we had a good dinner.

Previously it was another (uninviting) Mexican restaurant and, I believe, some kind of African restaurant. My wife got the carne tampiquena and, due in part to my immense creativity, I got the tacos. She enjoyed her meal although she complained about the small portion sizes and the fact that they served spicy mole (and not the sweet kind).  I remember my tacos being delicious--obviously I am the less nit picky one in the relationship. For dessert I ordered the corn flan and she ordered the choco flan. Again, I thought my flan was life-altering and my wife thought hers was ""a bit dry."" There were also complains thrown around about the tables looking kind of worn out. They may or may not have come from the person at the table who was not me.  I messaged the chef about the mole on facebook and he promptly stated he would start making it sweet instead of savory.

2015-06-21,2.0,"It's tricky to review a place when you come in on a specials night, but my first visit to Riques was last Tuesday for their $1 Taco Tuesday special.  Let's just say that even for a dollar a piece, I'm not sure I would spend that much money again. First, kudos to the restaurant for attempting higher-end tacos at this price point; you could tell a lot of effort was going into these tacos even though they were only a buck.  There were five tacos available last Tuesday at this price; I tried four, including a pollo asado, potato, chorizo and I believe a shredded beef taco.  The fifth was the calabacitas taco that I should have gotten, since others in my group said that was their favorite across the board. All of the tacos were fine.  There was just a sprinkle of the featured meat/potato in each taco, with assorted garnish on each tortilla.  But these things were small.  Truly, even for smaller appetites, consider ordering 6-8 tacos per person if you don't get anything else.  Otherwise, I think you might leave hungry! We also ordered the queso fundido and the guacamole.  For the price, the serving sizes of these items was a borderline insult.  Seriously, this was some tiny sh*t!!!  The guac, seriously, was enough for about 15 normal-size tortilla chips, max.  The queso?  All five of our party members got one small tortilla's worth and it was completely gone. The value prop here is a serious challenge at normal menu prices, so I can't recommend coming back here even though you do save a bit since it's BYO.  But still--you are in danger of leaving hungry here at all times.  And that's before I get into the kitchen speed at Riques, which was a bit of a nightmare even on a fairly quiet night...tacos came at random points, they weren't always right, but they were always slow.  Given the amount of chicken on my pollo asado taco, why did it take almost 30 minutes to get it?  Seriously?",0.9374,0.834,0.097,0.068,0.4895183360700603

2015-05-17,4.0,"I like this place. It is maybe the best Mexican food that I have had in Chicago since I moved here two years ago. The reason I give it four stars instead of five is that the service has been a bit off both times I have gone, but in a kind of endearing way? Like my orders were messed up both times, and stuff was missing, but they were really nice about it. Both of the times I have gone were with my friend who is from Mexico City. She is very friendly with the wait staff and restaurant owners, and it makes me feel like I am a guest rather than a patron. So much so that I felt kind of badly mentioning that my orders were messed up.  The first time I went was brunch of the Sunday after Chicago's St. Patrick's Day celebration. Rique's was very short-staffed that day. We did not get our plantains (they were out but didn't tell us until after the food came) or tortillas, and when the tortillas came, they were flour and not corn. Apparently all the kitchen staff was hungover and the cook and remaining wait staff were very stressed out. I got huevos with nopales, which were very good. We did not get charged for our drinks because of all the missing stuff. I was there with my parents who were visiting from out of town though, and they seemed displeased by the service and serving sizes (or prices relative to them).  I went back again for brunch this morning--it was a lot less crazy and I think better reflected what Rique's is like. Though it is not on the menu, you can get a horchata and espresso drink. I ordered the chilaquiles with chicken. When they were first brought out, the chicken was missing, but the order came back just a few minutes later with the chicken. I think it would have been just fine without the chicken as I couldn't finish the whole plate. They were quite good. My boyfriend got huevos with chorizo, which were also good. My friend got huevos divorciados--I didn't taste them, but they looked good as well. Everything is fresh and flavorful. We shared some flan for dessert, and it was amazing.  So I would say...if your expectation of a restaurant is perfect service and an overabundance of food, this may not be the place for you. I have celiac's disease and the food here hasn't made me sick, but I kind of wonder if it is the best place to go if you have food allergies. If you like friendly (but human) service, character, and really good food--try Rique's!

2015-04-14,5.0,This northern Mexican restaurant on the uptown/Edgewater border is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The owner Enrique is always pleasant and accommodating in explaining the menu. You can tell he takes pride in the food he prepares. Authentic and great atmosphere.

And whether the food was vegan, vegetarian or for meat eaters, it was all thoughtfully prepared and delicious!  The service was excellent, the eclectic decor charming and I will be going back!  Just a note before you go - it is byob, which makes it really fun to pair various libations with the varied range of flavors Enrique offers.",0.9785,0.721,0.279,0.0,0.5777777777777778

Ask for the Huevos de Patron, savory and delicious. Also taste the Braised Rabbit and the Choco Flan... find your own descriptors  ;) Great atmosphere, cozy dinning room,  friendly staff and as a plus it is BYOB. I highly recommend Rique's food and hospitality.",0.9633,0.754,0.246,0.0,0.5496103896103895
2015-04-06,5.0,"I've been waiting for this place to open all winter! I finally got to try it tonight and was not disappointed. I read Yelp reviews beforehand so I knew going in that portion sizes were not as big as other Mexican food places, and I have to agree with other reviewers that the trade-off is that it is the tastiest, most delicious food. I had the guacamole, a fish taco on corn tortilla, a side of rice, and elote. All delicious -- not a crumb remaining. Now I have to go back another time to try the Mexican hot chocolate and other fare. So glad to have a fine quality restaurant in the neighborhood. I have a feeling I'll be back many times.",0.9579,0.839,0.161,0.0,0.49027777777777776
2015-04-04,5.0,"Reopen this past winter 2015 as Riques Cocina Mexicana, it is the real deal. No shortcuts, from the appetizers, entrées and desserts. The mushrooms in guajillo sauce, the rabbit and venison in the entrées and the Ambrosia del Norte in the dessert. It is all excellently presented. The atmosphere is warm and very welcoming place. Well priced and great service. The new best restaurant in Uptown.",0.9562,0.728,0.245,0.027,0.49431818181818177

I came in on a Thursday night, and the waitstaff seated me promptly. My buddy and I ordered ceviche as an appetizer, which was fresh, attractive, and delicious. I then ordered the tacos with blue corn tortillas, and again, the ingredients seemed authentic, uncomplicated, and high quality. I can't wait to visit again, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet little Mexican place.",0.9747,0.746,0.254,0.0,0.5842857142857143
2015-03-15,2.0,"The food is OK, but small in portion and not necessarily what the menu describes. For example, the pollo flautas are made with potato, not chicken, a request for no onion will fall on deaf ears, and if more than one person gets the dishes that come with chips, you'd never know since it's a single serving per person. They need more staff too, getting water or coffee refilled was impossible without getting up and approaching the staff.",-0.2104,0.939,0.025,0.036,0.5626984126984127

I'll chalk it up to being new, as it wasn't that busy the night we went. I'd go back after some time so they can work out the kinks.",0.0516,0.874,0.064,0.062,0.2880681818181818
