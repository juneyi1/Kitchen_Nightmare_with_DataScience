After a while, I finally chose this place. The prices were decent and I could get more food for my buck. I decided on the cheesy skillet with hashbrowns. They came with a side of pancakes. The skillet didn't taste bad, but it had no flavor at all. It would probably taste better with some garlic or onions or something. The scrambled eggs on top didn't help either. The side of pancakes ended up tasting pretty good. They were sweet and fluffy. I regret not going with my original choice of just chocolate chip pancakes. I guess I know for next time. If you're just looking for your standard diner fare at a cheap price, this place will do.

2016-09-22,1.0,"I bought the $15 for $30 coupon deal, but I guess there had to be a catch.... and oh my gosh, why didn't we listen to the bad reviews from Yelp. Walking in and seeing absolutely no one but the workers there at dinner time should of been my second tip off, but alas, we all make mistakes. This is one mistake I will learn from, since I will not be returning.  I used to come to this place when it was Clarke's some years back, and loved it. While in the neighborhood last night with a part of 5 we decided to catch a bite to eat. I will list the pros first. The establishment looked very clean, and  our waiter was very polite.  However the reason for going to a restaurant is the food, and well, that was a horrible mess. First, my one order came back wrong - he had ordered a skillet and got an omelette instead, which he had sent back. The hash browns, if you would call them that were small cubed potatoes with seasoning, they did not look or taste cooked - and had a weird almost slimy texture. It seemed like they were nuked in the microwave. They were not browned AT ALL. Talk about an unappetizing sight. The pancakes were similar to my potatoes where they were WHITE, they looked like they should of been cooked AT LEAST another few minutes. Same with the english muffin that I got, it felt like it had been thrown in the toaster for 1 minute and was not left long enough to actually get toasted. My omelette tasted watery, and there were little fillings in this ""California"" omelette. On second look at the menu, I believe they gave me the wrong one since there were no avocado in it at all. Another person in our party got the Spring Wrap, the vegetables looked rancid. They were old, wilted, and those, unlike my potatoes, were browning - but that isn't what fresh vegetables are supposed to do...  The only saving grace here were the french fries, but if you mess up french fries there is a problem.  Honestly, it takes as much effort to make bad food as it is to make good food, especially breakfast food.",-0.9661,0.781,0.086,0.134,0.42910852713178305

The burger was good and only slightly over cooked. The onion rings made it massive, so I ate a couple of them off the burger first. My waffle fries weren't crisp and seasoned as expected. They were pretty light and limp, but it's still a fried potato so the taste was fine.  I then ordered a coffee brownie sundae, something I was very much looking forward to. The brownie was quite hard and dry, not the moist and chewy treat I was expecting, and lacked in coffee flavor. The ice cream was also hard and had ice crystals. Disappointing overall.

2014-01-23,2.0,"It actually pains me to have to write Clarke's a 2-star review, but after the last few visits, I won't be able to go back. My first visit to Clarke's last summer really impressed me. The price is right and the food was surprisingly good. I even ordered a Frangelico coffee (which I rarely do at breakfast) and was very pleasantly surprised. We were really pleased with the little diner and even went back the next day for another brunch. Now keep in mind, I used to serve at a few different restaurants, not five-star but really casual like Clarke's. I always give servers A TON of leeway if something goes wrong, even making excuses for them, because I've been there.  The bad service at Clarke's is inexcusable. The past FEW times the restaurant has been practically empty, yet it's like pulling teeth to get a cup of coffee. COFFEE! Same story with water--and at any restaurant they usually keep you filled up on both, but last time my boyfriend had to wait until after his food came to get the coffee he asked for right when we sat down.  The second last time we went, I asked where the drink menu was (for the Frangelico coffee) and the waitress acted like I was completely insane. She literally said she didn't know what I was talking about when I described the menu and the drink I wanted, only to bring the menu over two minutes later. I ordered the same drink, but when it came out it looked a little different than before and the waitress said ""funny, I didn't think it would look like that!"" after we literally watched her make it. What...? She was still confused about the food menu as we ordered, so I guess she was new. Still, she was pretty rude and we didn't even see her again until my boyfriend had to flag her down for the check. We decided to give it one more shot. Last time our food tasted great as usual, but came almost ten minutes apart so that he was halfway done when I started. There was no mention of this by the server, no ""sorry it'll be a second"" or ""there was a problem, it'll be out soon."" Nothing. Same ol' coffee and water problem! I'd really love to have a beverage with my breakfast.  I can overlook bad service when the staff is at least friendly, but at they don't even have that going for them.

My jaw almost dropped when our food finally arrived. My ""pancake"" looked more like a huge baked pie. It was covered with cinnamon and sugar and the apples were baked inside. If you have ever had an apple pancakes from Walker Brothers, then you can imagine what the ""baked apple"" was like. Yum!  For $10, I certainly got my money's worth.

I used to love this place - still do love the one on Belmont - but the Clarke's on Lincoln is downright pathetic now.  Tonight marks the 5th (that's right, FIFTH) time in a row that my take-out order is wrong.  You might be thinking, ""check your order before you leave, then,"" right?  I hear ya.  But the hubs has been going to pick it up, and this time he even asked them to double check it, which they claimed they had. When this happened last time, I called to talk to a manager.  Guess what?  No manager on duty, but they'll be sure to have one call me the following day.  Didn't happen.  I called again tonight when I realized the orders were wrong, and again, no manager - one will call me tomorrow.  I'm not holding my breath. On top of that, there was no offer to re-make (or make, I suppose it would be, since it wasn't what I ordered to begin with and half of it was missing) the food.  That to me was ridiculous. As someone who waited tables in college, I get that these things happen.  When they happen over and over, though, it's just bad business. PS: Should you try the chicken noodle soup, count the actual pieces of chicken.  It's kind of like ""Where's Waldo?' - only there's no Waldo, or in this case, chicken.  If you find 5, you've literally struck gold.",-0.9769,0.807,0.06,0.133,0.6263125763125762

But now, with needing to keep your cholesterol in check and the many other breakfasts spots out there, Clarke's is a mere memory of the good college days.

We were literally the only people in the place, so we figured our order should go smoothly and the food should come out on time. Everything was going so well, we got our drinks, put in our huge order, and waited patiently for what we usually expect to be a mediocre diner meal. About 10 minutes after we order the waiter comes to our table visibly stressed and asks if we can pay with cash. We said no, so he groaned and stomped away from our table to go talk to someone in the back. When he came back he said we can pay with cards, and mumbled the reason for asking us if we can pay with cash. Something along the lines of ""my boss is a dick, my boss is an asshole"" When we finally got our food it all came messed up. The appetizers themselves were trash and I know for a fact I could have microwaved myself some better nachos than what we got, but its cool, those were just the appetizers. We got our burgers, all ordered medium-rare, all cooked, super-well (burnt to a crisp). my greek burger came with 3 total slices of gyro meat and for some reason american cheese (they dont eat that in greece) and he forgot the tszaziki or however you spell it. I reminded him to bring it and again, he groaned and pranced away to the kitchen to fetch my wonderful sauce. The sauce didn't help and the burger was still shit. our meals sucked, we didnt finish anything and we all payed over 20 bucks. buzz killed. rage over. if your in this neighborhood at 6AM and really need some food.

It took about 10 minutes before a server actually came to our table. This didn't really surprise me since during that time span I didn't actually see any employees in the dining room aside from a lone bus boy. After taking our drink and food order at the same time, our server said the drinks would be about 2 minutes. About 15 minutes after that she returned with one drink at a time, I guess it is too difficult to carry a cup in each hand. about 15 more minutes go by and the server returns to tell me that there is no elk meat left and I agree to a regular burger instead. After having been seated for almost an hour, my soup arrives but the server spills some on my knee and then says sorry and walks away, not even offering a napkin or water to clean it up with.  Before I could finish my soup, our meals came out. My burger was raw in the middle and the fries were cold. At this point my expectations were already gone. It is apparent that complaining would be a moot point as there is obviously a systemic problem in this place. The prices are what I would expect to pay in Chicago, but the quality at Clarke's is about as good as a fast food joint.

Toast was full, and Nookies Too had an unusual out the door wait line. So we walked down Lincoln Avenue where we now live and dined at Clarke's. I should have known this was going to be bad from the start. The hostess told us we could sit in the bar area (which looked quite nice and modern) or she could see if she had a table available. From the looks of it, half the place was empty and there were only three of us. I suggested that we see what tables were available and then if we didn't like our options or had to wait we would sit at the bar. The hostess said and I quote ""so you actually want me to look for a table for you three?"" It wasn't a statement, it sounded like she couldn't believe we wanted her to get us a table. If it was self seating, I would have gladly marched over and found a vacant space. She found us a table and left us with menus. We waited 20 minutes and drank two pitchers of water (which the kind bus boy refilled promptly) before anyone talked to us. We actually told the bus boy that we needed a waiter and he went to talk to the manager or something. After being informed that we did not have a server, another 10 minutes went by and the bus boy looked really nervous. Finally, I saw the manager (he appeared to be) point to our table by the window and motion for a server to take care of us. The manager never came over to talk to us. 25 minutes after arriving at Clarke's someone asked us if we wanted coffee. Mind you, a group of guys sat down about ten minutes after us and we eating already. It appeared that we were invisible. I was very angry at this point and was about to leave. All the waiter said was ""I'm sorry"" but it didn't sound sincere.  The food took 20 minutes to arrive and my roommate's pancakes were missing. Upon finishing the rest of the meal, my roommate had to get up and chase the server around and ask for her own pancakes. He sprinted to the kitchen and found some soggy substitutes that she was supposed to eat. When we were done, our plates were cleared by the nice bus boy but our server was nowhere to be found. After waiting 10 more minutes and with no sign of him we went up to the register with cash in hand. The woman standing at the register stared right through us and refused to help us. We left our cash on the counter and said ""we were done waiting."" We really doubt whether anyone heard. WORST customer service I have ever experienced and I frequently dine out at busy rush periods.

2011-02-10,3.0,"A Clarke's with beer service?  Oh my, that's dangerous. But perhaps that's not the right question to start this review with.  The question that probably should be asked about this (or any other) location of Clarke's relates to the mini-chain's slogan (""oh my, you should eat."").  That question is: oh my, should you eat (here)?  The answer is: oh my, that's complex. With most Clarke's, the answer is a resounding ""oh my yes!""  But, the problem for this particular Clarke's is that I feel like you have to be a bit inebriated (which is good because, as mentioned, they serve beer) to put up with some location-specific things.  When a few of us wandered in from across the street at Lincoln Hall recently, for example, it was actually louder in here than in the concert venue.  The music blasting from overhead was a mix of 80s anthems and dance beats.  Which was fine.  Just loud.  In fact it reminded me of the vibe at the Belmont location (in the middle of Boystown) in the early 2000s.  Oh my, that's oontzy! Except, unlike there and then, the servers seemed to be more interested in being ""scene"" than serving.  And this is probably just me getting older, but  the groups of youngsters talking loudly over the music was pretty distracting.  Oh my, that's annoying. On the other hand, the food is so decadently tasty that I feel like it makes it almost worth a visit before 2:00 a.m.  The North Shore Potatoes here were just as good (and filling and cheap at $4.99) as I remember.  They almost create a pairing with any bad beer.  The taste of these after a macro American ale makes them pretty much the greatest thick, deep fried potatoes in town.  They also seem to prevent hangovers.  Truth.  Oh my, that's a claim. The other food here is about what can be expected.  Kind of made halfway to great, but never terrible.  It's pretty expensive for a diner but if you've dropped a bunch of money already at the bars around here, it doesn't seem too bad.  Oh my, that's a lot of questionable decisions.   So, oh my, should you eat here?  If you're drunk, oh my yes!  If you're sober, oh my probably not!",0.9872,0.798,0.141,0.061,0.5532312925170066

That was not to be the case though-the food took forever to arrive and our drinks came juice and coffee, promise. The table had a bad leg and as I leaned on it it shifted and fell on the floor, again I promise it was not a result of my state.  The busser was johnny on the spot, he came by to pick it up. Mopped up the oj and when I asked him if we could get another glass since neither server seemed up to the task. I would comment on the food but what's the point?",-0.3384,0.82,0.089,0.091,0.555

Then while I took my child to wash up after finishing his meal, the last 2 dishes arrived. How ridiculous!!! We almost left to go to McDonald's! Wish we would have. Now, if the food tasted good, I would have given another star, but I had mini burgers- terrible! They were dried out and the fries looked like they had been sitting for a long time. Not to mention, I ordered sweet potato fries, and received regular. I was not about to ask for the correction, or we might have been there another hour. We had to go put more money in our parking meter we were in there so long...almost 2 hours!! The waitress gave the excuse that there was only one cook...and that there is always only one cook!

2010-10-24,1.0,"I have been to the location on Belmont many times, good food and service, not the case on Lincoln.  We just got home from the place after having an awful experience.  We orders wings to start with and burgers.  When asked what type of bread my boyfriend wanted he said plain, the waiter corrected him by saying: you mean white right? I thought he was pretty rude but didn't think much of it.  He brought us the wings and didn't bring plates he then disappeared after waiting a couple of minutes we flagged down another waiter and asked for plates.  No big deal, it happens I'm not picky whatever....  My boyfriend then bit into a wing to discover it was black on the inside.  He spit it out and grabbed another one, which was ok.  We figured a bad wing in the batch ok whatever.  The waiter arrives with our burgers and tells my boyfriend; ""I'm sorry I just remembered you wanted a white bun, is it ok? or do you want me to swap it?""  My boyfriend said ""Yes please swap it.""  At that moment I thought; you took the time to correct him when he asked you for a plain bread but yet didn't bother to get it right?? Ok whatever just bring the burger with the white bread so we can eat.  The burger arrives we start eating, both of our burger patties were very pink in the inside.  I thought it was just a little piece and decided to eat the edges first after maybe half a burger, I couldn't eat anymore and noticed my boyfriend had stopped eating as well.  I started to pick the pink meat off the burger when our waiter stopped by to ask if we wanted a refill on our pops.  We both said yes and expected him to ask how the food was, which he did not.  He came back with our pops and didn't even look at us or gave us a chance to say anything.  I really don't like to complain about food at small restaurants or diners who know what they will bring us back out if we do complain.  We decided to take them to go and to throw them in the toaster oven when we got home.  I asked for two boxes to go and at that point is when the waiter asked if everything was ok.  I said actually no the burgers were undercooked, he said ""Oh I asked for them medium, you could of asked for me to throw them back on the grill""  I said ""We didn't ask for them medium, you didn't even ask how we wanted them and no that is okay we will do that when we get home.""  At this point we just wanted to get out of there.  We got the check and paid it at the register.  I did not feel he deserved a tip so I did not leave one.  As we were walking out our waiter: Jarryd screams out: Thank you for coming and thanks alot for your wonderful tip!!  I walked back into the restaurant and gave him a piece of my mind.  First of all we were not even asked how we wanted our burgers, he never took the time to check on our table and he was expecting a tip?? Are you kidding me?? He didn't notice me picking the pink meat off my burger? I know how much waiters make and how important it is to tip but if you flat out ignore your customers how do you expect to deserve any kind of tip?? I could not believe the nerve to complain and out loud to a customer about not leaving a tip when he didn't even deserve one.  Jarryd's manager will be receiving a call tomorrow morning.",0.9815,0.85,0.098,0.052,0.41511567038162783

We walked in on a nice Sunday afternoon, and sat on the bar-side.  We waited 15 minutes before going to the bar and asking if we had a server.  The waitress came over and took our order right away.  So, we thought things were looking up...we were wrong.  It took another 15 minutes for my coke to arrive, and this occurred just as our nachos came up.  After 5 minutes with our appetizer, the server came over to ask my friend what she had ordered again.  Apparently, she was just then putting in the order.  We waited a solid 30 minutes for our food to come out.  We were actually contemplating leaving at this point.  Once our food came, I noticed that only half of my club sandwich with sprouts actually had sprouts (what?) and did not come with the sweet potato fries I had ordered.  When we were ready to leave, I went up to the counter to ask for the check, because the waitress had disappeared once again.  I also asked for the manager, seeing as the service was the worst I have ever had, and the food order was not correct.  My mouth fell to the floor when I was told that our waitress was the manager.  I paid the tab, and left no tip (which is hard for me, being an ex-server myself.)  The girl up front wouldn't even get the woman for me, she was in the kitchen helping the new chef supposedly. Was anything good about this experience?  During our time in this restaurant, I questioned my decision to stay, and witnessed three tables sit and then leave after not being acknowledged by anyone on staff.  We weren't the only ones being ignored, so I guess that is good at least.",0.4871,0.859,0.072,0.069,0.5554885590599875

2008-06-10,1.0,"If I could leave a rating of ZERO stars, I would. But I can't, so one star will have to suffice. My girlfriend and I live in Logan Square and had taken the Fullerton bus in order to connect to the Brown Line. We got over by DePaul and realized how hungry we were. We decided to go to Clarke's on Lincoln, as we had never been (though we are (were) frequent diners at Clarke's on Belmont).   We both ordered the exact same thing: Buddha Supreme sandwich with fries. This is not a complicated sandwich. It is essentially tomato, sprouts, cucumber, and cheddar on a pita. My girlfriend's meal arrived promptly, but there was no sign of mine. We waited over seven minutes, and still no food...the IDENTICAL food to what my girlfriend already had. I noticed our waitress eyeballing the table from across the room, and then I saw her hustle back into the kitchen. She emerged and told me that the delay was due to them having to make more fries. However, the 10 minutes it took AFTER THIS for me to finally be presented with my food indicates to me that my meal had been forgotten. It was about 2:00 in the afternoon on a Sunday; it was not busy at all, and the place was adequately staffed. How this could have happened is still a mystery to me, but I was willing to let it slide.  It was a simple mistake. Right? FINALLY our waitress brought my food (which, again, is just a cold sandwich and fries) almost a full 20 minutes after my girlfriend was already served. I was stoked to eat, as I had really worked up an appeteite by this point. I looked down, getting ready to taste one of those delicious fries, when I noticed a BLACK, CURLY HAIR PERCHED ON THE TOP OF THE FRIES LIKE A CHEERLEADER ON TOP OF THE PYRAMID. Let me say it again, there was a fucking black hair clear as day right on top of the off-white background of the fries (the fry at the very top of the pile, in fact). Not only is this disgusting, but it means that the kitchen staff is obviously not exercising proper kitchen guidelines (hairnets, etc.). I summoned the waitress (who seemed about as intelligent as, I don't know, my fries). I pointed out the hair. She rushed it back to the kitchen and brought out the same sandwich and ""new fries."" The meal should have been comped at this point. But I was never offered a comp, and there was no one in sight who looked like the manager/owner. In fact, there was no staff in sight who appeared to be over the age of 25. Anyway, I ate what I could choke down of my pathetic Clarke's meal. While I was eating, some joker was mopping the floor inches from our table with water that looked and smelled like it had been harvested from someone's ass. This is inexcusable behavior.  Our waitress brought the bill and promptly disappeared. We waited about five minutes, and when there was still no sign of her, I went to the counter to pay someone else. I used a card, left absolutely no tip, signed and returned the restaurant's copy, and pocketed mine. My girlfriend went to use the bathroom, and I went outside to have a cigarette and wait. I saw the waitress stink-eyeing me from inside and figured it was because of the stiff. I never stiff. I usually tip 20%-25%, but this service was so poor that she had it coming. Anyway, she starts walking toward the door. ""Oh my God,"" I thought, ""Is she actually going to confront me on the stiff? This should be glorious."" She sticks her head out and asks ""Did you take our copy?"" It took me a second to figure out that in the less than one minute I had been outside smoking, our waitress or the MENSA waitress that rang me up had managed to lose the restaurant copy of the credit card receipt.  I checked my pocket. Nope, only my copy. At this point things were being said to me to imply that I pocketed the restaurant's copy. Why I would do this after I had ALREADY PAID and the card had ALREADY BEEN ACCEPTED AND PROCESSED is a mystery to me. Anyway, so I go back inside to help sort this out.   The waitress who rang us up pulls out this pile of about 15 credit card receipts and says she's going to go through them one by one and match them to the computer records of the meals. Because my IQ is above 16, I suggested that a much more efficient way to handle things would be for me to briefly flip through the stack looking for my signature. Of course, the receipt was right there in the pile in front of these girls' eyes.   I don't know who owns Clarke's, and I can't find a website that works ( clarkesdiner.com  does nothing), otherwise I would have written the owner directly. I hope the owner looks at this. I will NEVER eat at your restaurants again. Not the one on Belmont, which we used to love and frequent regularly, and certainly not the one on Lincoln. The Lincoln restaurant is pathetic, the people you have working there are pathetic, and you violate health codes.  This shithole should be closed down.

The names and quoted passages are accurated.However,this is just a brief explination of the racist events that occured. At approximate 3:30 am Saturdaynight/ sunday morining me and two friends entered Clarke's, an 24-hour diner located on Lincoln Ave. in Lincoln Park. When seated, a caucasian waitress by the name of Debbie approached our table, slammed her hands down and rudely asked what we wanted to eat. Initally ignoring this as a sign of frustration ,due to the heavy volume of patrons in the resturant that evening, we proceeded to order. When ordering, I asked Debbie how much it would cost to add cheese to a burger that I was ording. Once again, she rudely replied, "" Don't you people know how to read???' Seeing that I had become frustrated with her behavior she asks"" WHAT!!! Do you have something to say or something??"" So I replied , "" YES! Are you having a bad day or something?"" Debbie then goes on to say "" You know....if this was 1950, your ass would deserve a lynching!!!"" At this remark, I become pissed and frustrated.I called the police to inform them of the incident and headed to the main register to see if there was someone else who could assist me and my friends. I informed him that the waitress had been rude. I also informed him that I was a regular patron, who has been eating there for years and have never had a problem, or been so horribly disrepected by a member of their staff. The waiter agreed as he'd remember me from previous visits and offered to seat me and my friends and wait on us. While speaking with the gentleman, Debbie comes from the kitchen and begans to curse at me calling me bitches and telling me and my "" nigger friends to get the fuck out"" We refused and sat at the table the other gentleman offered us. Keep in mind the gentleman never reprimanded Debbie, even though her actions were obviously racist and demeaning. I began crying and ranting as to how they could let something like this happen in front of their faces and say nothing. In response, the gentleman offered to pay for out meal. At this point, the entire resturant is looking at me and my friends. Debbie yells,""Don't worry..she's just high!!"" YEt another demeaning statement. At that point my inital reaction ( besides wanting to punch her in her face) was to leave. However, in an overt refusal to leave a resturant when I was order to do so by a racist waitress I told my friends to sit in the seats the gentleman picked for us so that we could wait for the police. Once the police arrive, Debbie approaches and tells them that she wants us out becuase we were rude and disrespectful to HER! None Other patrons ( none of whom were people of color) came to our defense. The officers ordered us to step outside. When the asked my side of the story I began to tell them. Of course I am upset and am crying. So, the officers continue to cut me off and ask why I am yelling. I explained that i was hurt and insulted by being called a nigger at an establishment that I have patronized for years. When I insited that something be done the cops refused to take any action on Debbie and demanded that we leave the premises. I infromed the officers that the gentelman waiter offered to seat us AND pay for our meal as a result of Debbie's actions. I also asked that if we were causing a disturbance, why would the man offer to seat us and pay for our food. The cops replied "" we dont know and we don't care, but if you go back into the resturant we will arrest all three of you for trespassing"" This is my story. Since telling my story I have heard various other students of color complain about the horrible service and the racism they have also had to deal with at this establishment. This is not just my problem...this is ALL OF OUR problem. How is it that we cannot enjoy the conviences of an establishment or reside peacefully in a neighborhood where we are spending THOUSANDS of dollars to go to school??

It wasn't really toasted, and it was served with one single packet of grape jelly.  Blah.  Our server was really nice, but she seemed to have way too many tables so it was tough for her to get by to check on us as often as we would have liked.   I realize that I may have been to Clarke's on an off day, but there is no way I would return to Clarke's for breakfast with Ann Sather's being a relatively short distance away.",0.8993,0.808,0.12,0.071,0.5586956521739131

Because usually people came there after they were already drunk, and now they have the option to continue drinking. Anyway, this is the place I know I'll have to visit and eat at if I ever get back to Chicago one of these days. I miss it so much.",0.9523,0.839,0.127,0.034,0.5064814814814814

2007-01-25,1.0,"This is by far the absolutely worst Clarke's out of the 3.  The service here has been absolutely horrible every time I go there, which was only because my friend used to live down the street.  Luckily, that is no longer the case and I haven't been back since the last time... so let me tell everyone a story about that incident. We're seated on a weekday night.  Not too busy there, just the usual amount of people seeing as how this place is almost always full.  We're waiting, waiting, waiting.  Finally some guy comes over to take our order.  We order 1 grilled cheese & fries, and one order of hash browns with cheese on them - plus a couple drinks.  A good 20 minutes later our waiter (who hasn't checked on us at all) brings us our food out.  Not the right order.  We tell him once again what the order actually was, and he apologizes and goes to get it corrected.  Waiting, waiting waiting.  Finally he brings out yet another incorrect order.  This time we basically just got an extra grilled cheese but the rest was correct.  We didn't even bother getting it corrected again because of course this guy has already walked away.  We eat, finish, have someone clear our table, and we sit.  Our waiter is busy conversing with some friend of his who had walked in, laughing, carrying on.  Meanwhile we're waiting on our check.  We ask a bus boy to get our check for us since homie obviously isn't going to do anything.  The bus boy goes to tell him, and still nothing.  Waiting, waiting.  We get up and tell him personally.  Still waiting.  Finally we have to ask yet another bus boy to tell our waiter, who has now disappeared for a bit, that we need our check.   It was seriously 30 minutes after we had finished our food that we finally got the check.  I go up to the counter to pay, and the waiter mentions to me that he didn't charge us for one of the 2 grilled cheeses for the mix up.  First of all, WE ONLY ORDERED ONE, so of course we shouldn't have been charged!  We don't leave this jerkoff a tip, because at this point we had been there almost 2 hours. And this is where it gets even better... my friend left her bag.  We notice right as we walk outside, so she goes back in to get it, and the waiter says something to her along the lines of me being a bitch because I didn't tip him. Unfortunately, this isn't the only time I've had horrid service here, and therefore, I shall never return.  Their food definitely isn't worth all that wasted time & to be insulted by their staff.",0.2306,0.859,0.074,0.068,0.5079365079365079

It looked like prepackaged American Cheese singles melted on top, which may be ok for when you're sitting at home alone, watching a movie and it's the only form of cheese you have in the house...but for a restaurant? Um, no. Get something better. When she got the fries, the cheese wasn't even hot anymore and it was already solidifying back into its newly formed shape around the fries. Blah.  I DID get an omlette here once and it was pretty decent. That's why this place gets 2 stars instead of just 1.  Service is just 'eh'.  This place isn't the WORST, but it sure as heck isn't great.
