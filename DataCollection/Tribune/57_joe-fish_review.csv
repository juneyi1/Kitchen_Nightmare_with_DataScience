2017-06-11,5.0,"Joe fish has become one of my favorite places to eat downtown. Generous size portions and extremely fresh quality. I always feel welcomed every time I dine in. I usually sit at the bar and the bartenders are great. If you go when Jen is working ask for her special punch- it taste like a dreamsicle! I always change up my order because theres so many great options and I've yet to have a meal that my tastebuds disagreed with. Favorite apps are the crab cake (generous size with a lot of crab meat)  and the buratta.  The burrata is DEFINITELY a sharing size portion so bring a friend. The lobster bisque that they feature on occasion is the best bisque I've ever had. The presentation is incredible and it comes with a small lobster tail on top.. For $8!!! While we're talkin crab, the crab Louie salad is to die for. The full salad is enough to fill 3-4 people up so go for the half. For main dishes I've tried the sea bass Oscar style (YUM). My friend got the Dover sole one time and I got to try a bit of it and it was so well prepared I plan to come back soon to order it on my own. All around A+ quality from presentation to taste and service! This place is a must try for all",0.9923,0.776,0.2,0.024,0.5343537414965986

Worth going, but ONE thing was off. 3 Stars: I was ok, but in a city like Chicago you can find better places. I wouldn't come back. 2 Stars: Disappointed. I wouldn't come back, even if it was the last place in Chicago. 1 Star: Don't go here! Rip-off, Tourist-trap, dangerous, or something like this. Please close this place.  Bringing my family and friends here, every time they visit me! I am just gonna start listing what I love about the place: - Very beautiful interior - Great background music - Best service in Chicago (one waiter got up on a chair in order to take a picture from all of us from above) - Amazing happy hour (Mo-Fr. 4-7: $1 Oysters and $5 Sauvignon Blanc) - Oysters from different regions with different dips - Complimentary different (delicious) choices of bread PS: here are two secret tips: 1. Reserve their round table in the corner for 8 people. It is very private and beautiful. 2. They have cheap punch bowls, that you can share with multiple people You are welcome, Chicago NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.... it is closed!!!! WHY?!? Can the owner of the restaurant please let me know, if there is a new or other restaurant that is replacing Joe Fish? Also, where did the waiter transfer?

2016-03-23,5.0,I guess I should have written about this place much sooner. I am very sorry to see this place closed because the food and service here were absolutely fantastic. The service I received here is some of the best I have ever received anywhere. I thought this place was perfect. It was probably poorly marketed? When I recommended this place to family and friends they all said the same thing. I never heard of this place? This place needed to have created a bigger buzz amongst foodies like myself. The seafood was pristine and cooked perfectly. The place and the ambiance created were beautiful.,0.9835,0.716,0.27,0.014,0.6113636363636363

2016-02-15,1.0,"Quite honestly one of my worst restaurant experiences ever last evening. What do you get when you sum up slow, inattentive, and noncommunicative waitstaff service + extremely slow food service (entrees served an hour and 10 minutes after being seated) + defensive management full of excuses? A Valentine's Day dinner that was very subpar. This was not my first time dining at the restaurant (first time was actually quite amazing), which makes this 2nd experience so much more unpalatable knowing what the restaurant is actually capable of and not delivering on the execution. Management didn't even offer to comp us on any portion of our meal to compensate for the ruined experience, instead twice offering excuses for the slow service. My wife and I live very close to the restaurant and now acknowledge that there are better choices for dining in the area with better food and service, namely Joe's Seafood and Steaks, RPM Italian, RPM Steak, Mastro's, and Siena Tavern. Joe Fish needs to streamline their operations better to retain customer trust.

The charred octopus was decent but only came with 1/2 of a lemon, they split everything onto 2 plates so only one of us got the lemon and it desperately needed more. The bread was okay, the house roll was definitely stale. The scallop & risotto entree was average, the scallops were slightly underdone and could have used a better sear, the risotto needed more salt & pepper, overall the dish needed lemon or acidity or something fresh. The ""smashed"" potatoes were actually mashed (when I think of ""smashed potatoes"" i think of big lumps of potato but that was not the case) and desperately needed more salt & pepper.

It's INSANITY.  That is such a fantastic deal especially given the location.  I love oysters and I love wine, so what could be better?   The restaurant itself I don't think ever really gets very crowded, so it's easy to sit and chat with friends.  The first time we went, our oysters weren't cleaned very well, but they were $1 so it's not that big of a deal.  The second time, the service while sitting at the bar wasn't very good as it took our oysters 30 minutes to be delivered.  I'm sure if I wasn't enjoying the company of my  friend and my wine glass, it would have been a bigger deal.     We also tried the crab cake, which was fantastic, and the chopped salad which was just ok.   I don't know if I would come for dinner, but I plan to come frequently for the $1 oysters.",0.9523,0.785,0.157,0.058,0.554074074074074
2016-02-14,1.0,"Tonight, valentine's day was our second visit to the restaurant. We had a positive experience a few months back with a very attentive waiter but today, I felt as if we stepped into a completely different restaurant.  We were seated promptly at 7:30 with a reservation, the venue was quite busy which is a good sign. Rather quickly, water came and our waitress asked if we had any questions about the menu. We came primarily to order the crab cake again which they do exceptionally well.  The menu had changed but she was able to get our order in. Within 10 minutes we ordered our entrees, seared salmon and hanger steak for entrees with a side of mushrooms. Crab cake made it to our table about 15 minutes later and it was excellent as we expected.  Then comes the long wait... We start to see the table to our left and the table to our right getting their appetizers, salads, AND entrees served. The table to our left arrived 15 minutes after we were seated, and the table to our right 30 minutes after we were seated! After nearly all the tables surrounding us are close to finishing their entrees we were still left with no entrees to be seen 75 minutes after we placed our orders. By this point I'm thinking, why didn't the server notice and let us know earlier, when others were getting their food that something was wrong and she could inquire with the kitchen? Why didn't ANYONE see that we were desperately looking around for servers, managers, waving our hands only to be ignored? Why did the manager choose to talk to the kitchen versus come to our table to let us know that he is aware that there was a delay with our food and then go back to the kitchen. We were invisible.  When the manager finally did come, it was a very defensive conversation. First, it was a holiday so he reported that they were unprepared for the volume and for us to have patience. (why did the tables next to us not have to be patient?) Next, we were the ones who shouldn't be upset so we should ""calm down"" and ""enjoy the evening."" I could go to any number of restaurants if I wanted to enjoy my evening and not come to Joe Fish to be ignored by the staff as if we did something wrong. This was completely unacceptable. He tried to get us to accept dessert or coffee to smooth things over. Nothing was going to fix this dinner.  What started out as a great evening ended up a disappointment. Having a meal out is just as much about the service as it is the food. The food was fine but given the circumstances, it was difficult to enjoy. Amends would have been comping the meal but that clearly was not an acceptable solution to the manager. A number of things went completely wrong this evening and because we have a choice, we will not be returning to this restaurant.

2015-10-10,2.0,"It's been ages since I've written a review on here. I've always felt it was important to share good experiences, bad ones, and those in between. That said - I'm fairly torn on my review for Joe Fish as the food was pretty good, our server Abel - was able (I'm hilarious) and accommodating, but the place itself was in complete disarray.  We went for an early-ish dinner this past Friday - seated promptly and greeted quickly. Our server was enthusiastic (possibly new to the restaurant so it felt a bit forced but he was a really nice and genuine guy so free pass on being too ""scripted"") We dine out often. Probably too much and love checking out the newest places or hitting up old standbys. Joe Fish doesn't really fall into either category - it's far from trendy, it's more fake nice than truly upscale although the mgmt would have you think otherwise.  Some oddities:  1) we were seated in the back section. Nice and quiet, solid table. That was until the staff was asked by the manager to set, reset, unset (that's a word, trust) 3 different tables about 5 different times for a variety of different sizes parties. This included said manager sliding (maybe tossing?) chairs across the dining room section to the wait staff, basically right past our table, having LOUD and seemingly nasty conversations with them - basically just imposing himself, likely inadvertently, on us for the beginning portion of our meal.  2) We ordered some obnoxiously large chocolate cake for dessert. I'm not sure if it was another manager or their ""dessert bringer outter"" - but upon serving us the cake she asked in a very condescending tone ""special occasion?"" - almost in a way to say ""awwww, you guys saved up for months to eat at this fancy restaurant"" - honey, let me fill you in on a few things. Your restaurant isn't special occasion worthy, I eat at more expensive places on Wednesdays at 3pm and just because your clientele are mostly suburbanites in terrible clothing - don't mistake our jeans for anything less than fashionable. We're not kids. We're the type of people you should want at your establishment - and even though your food was OK - there are far too many other places that will get my business.  Oh yeah - the food. It's apparently a ""new menu"" which meant nothing to us since we've never been - but if this is a spot you frequent it's apparently now called Joe Fish Italian - and the fish was almost an after thought. Weird. The grilled octopus was tasty - nice kick to it and the Caesar was nice as well. We also had the Chilean Sea Bass which was well prepared and the crispy edges were the best part. The Cacio e pepe was the recommended pasta - it's simple as it should be but ultimately sort of bland.  So - food was good. Our server was nice. However the front of house negatively impacted what should have been a much higher rating. Food only goes so far if the overall experience is less than desirable. It's not like we were whipping and nae-naeing at the table. Puh-lease",0.9965,0.766,0.172,0.062,0.605052429052429

2015-01-31,5.0,"This review is LONG overdue! We visited a couple of weeks after it opened and have visited at least once a month if not more since, so mea culpa to the incredible staff for not acknowledging how awesome they are sooner. First off the food is incredible. We always try to eat as cleanly as possible when out and about, which can be several nights a week (we live here for the restaurants & do take advantage). Many River North restaurants make this difficult because they are trying to be different which many times equates into quite heavy calorie dishes.  We love fish and depending upon the type of fish it can be challenging to cook due to varying thicknesses. Joe Fish nails it every time. We have never had a bad piece of fish or over or under cooked fish. Our fave waiter Angelo always says ""no problem, we can do it"" to every one of my changes from no salt to dressings on the side to not this ingredient to add this ingredient (obviously it has to be on the menu or they don't have it) . He even took my bestie's dietary needs with stride and made a fan of her... she has many food allergies. It helps that the chefs and kitchen staff are cool with alterations.  Quite honestly Angelo spoils us. He is so thoughtful and attentive. The managers Edi & Kevin always go out of their way to say hello and make people feel welcome. Even though Joe Fish is a really nice restaurant they never make you feel like it is snooty like a few others in the neighborhood.

2015-01-29,2.0,"Well what can I say about this place without soundings like I had a rocky fight and lost. Today was my wife's birthday and I had gone online to reserve a table on open tables. In the special request box I stated that I was celebrating a birthday and marked my reservations for 6:30pm. Upon our arrival the valet person was really nice as well as the 3 host that were standing in the front of the restaurant. The young lady that took our coats was very nice and sat us immediately. Our server was really nice in the beginning by making suggestions on the menu as well as cocktails. We ordered the Alaskan king crab legs to share and a tomato, bacon and blue cheese salad where the tomatoes were sliced very thick 2 per person with bacon, blue cheese and let me not forget 2 large onion rings. The server needless to say never acknowledged my wife's birthday, I had to remind him that there was a birthday but by that moment I was ready to go. It took him 15 minutes to bring the check after we didn't want dessert. Overall the meal was over priced and not worth it. Also, the drinks were not the best but the abeyance was cute and the music was nice. For the future Joe Fish please read the reservation special request it may help with making someone's birthday special.",0.9804,0.782,0.168,0.05,0.546921768707483
2015-01-28,3.0,"On a particularly busy winter's Friday night in Downtown Chicago, we just weren't getting lucky when it came to bars and lounges. The first four places we attempted to go were either too full, or weren't allowing more patrons inside. We ended up at Joe Fish, and even though they weren't accepting additional customers at their bar area, they checked with management, and allowed us to be seated at a table in the dining area. While it was a nice concession, it was kind of strange, because no one bothered to tell our waiter that we would just be ordering drinks, not food. I think he was kind of miffed until he remembered how expensive drinks = bigger gratuity. Joe Fish has a fun cocktail menu with myriad ""fish bowl""-style punches that are house-made and available in a variety of sizes. At $12 a pop for the ""individual""-sized punches, the price seemed fair given the fact that you're in Chicago, at a nice restaurant, and that the punches are homemade and served in cool bowls. Sadly, however, they weren't as boozy as I would have liked. We ordered one Pisco Punch and one Fish House Punch. Fortunately for our waiter, George, we needed to order another round before heading out, so this time we stuck with the non-Punch concoctions, and ordered a Blood Orange Mojito (surprisingly boozy and not too sweet) and a Cucumber Fizz (pleasantly buzzing).  $11 and $12, respectively. Again, fair. I guess the moral of the story here is that what the Punch Bowls lack in apparent booze they make up for in kitschiness, where as for about the same price, you can get a more traditional cocktail without the kitsch but with perhaps more kick. Nicely enough, even though we were only drinking, George offered our table a trio of ""Amuse Bouche"" tastes, which were fun little cucumber foam creations, as well as allowed us to choose from the bread basket of fresh and delicious breads. All in all, sub-$50 before tax, and although it wasn't the ""bar"" experience we were seeking, it wasn't so bad.",0.9874,0.842,0.123,0.035,0.5916666666666668

For my entree I went with a delicious pasta dish full of clams and scallops in a white wine sauce. The portion was huge and I could not get enough!

2014-12-22,3.0,"I want to round my 3.5 up to a 4, but I just can't. We made last-minute reservations on a Saturday night, wanting to try a new place & both myself & the manfriend love anywhere that focuses on seafood, so we decided on Joe Fish.  I ordered a glass of wine (holy crap are some of these wines crazy expensive... $20/glass? Ouch.), solely based on price & the fact that it was a Chardonnay. I believe the glass I picked was $12 (this comes in to play later), and it was really delicious. For my entree I chose the Lobster Roll (again, I hate to say it, but I picked it for two reasons, 1) Love me a lobster roll and 2) it was one of the few entrees under $30). The manfriend had the scallop risotto, and we ordered a side of the crab fried rice to share.  The lobster roll came out and it was covered (dripping, really) in mayo. I come from the belief that, a good lobster roll needs no mayo, so I was pretty disappointed that a place that focuses on seafood would do this to lobster. It was good, but I just really hate when they are all mayo'd up, I should've asked before I ordered.  The bread it came on was good though, crispy & buttery, the way it should be. The side of slaw was pretty good as well, but it was sort of warm/room-temperature-ish.  The manfriend really liked his risotto, it came with 3 large scallops & the rice was cooked perfectly. We totally failed at ordering the side of crab fried rice (it sounded good, and it was good!) but he was on rice overload.  When we got the check I gave the waiter my credit card & we paid up... but when I got the bill back to sign, I realized that I was overcharged for the glass of wine I had. They rang up a $16 glass instead of the $12 glass I ordered (and the waiter repeated the wine back to me, so unless they poured the wrong one... maybe that's why it was so good!), but I'm not one to casue a huge fuss over $4. Just an FYI to check your bill before handing over your card. I like the ambiance of Joe Fish... the decor, colors, lighting, etc. The music is good too, save for the weird ""Like us on Facebook"" thing that was spolen every few minutes. That was bizarre. I'm honestly just blown away by how expensive it was... I swear I'm not cheap, I'll spend $$$$ on a great meal when it's warrented, but I just don't feel like Joe Fish is worth the cost.",0.9971,0.711,0.208,0.081,0.5970029970029971

Brunch selections are somewhat limited.  A lot of sea-food things, but nothing amazing.  Maybe one or true items that you expect to find at a typical brunch.   Menu is quite pricey.  For two people, for an excellent brunch, you want to spend $40 tops.  But here, you spend close to $70, and it is not even that good. We had the shrimp with grits, and the burger.  A drink and a coffee.  Both the drink and the coffee were nothing to write home about, and together, they were over $20.

2014-12-08,4.0,"I went here on a date with a man I haven't known very long, and I think he was definitely trying to impress me - and he did! We were originally going to go to the Paris Club for dinner, but there was a 45 minute wait so we decided to walk around the city (it was cooooold!!!) and while walking, we say Joe Fish.  It looked nice so we went in.  There wasn't a wait even though the place was very busy.  I liked the music they were playing too - it was an upbeat Jazz... the Paris Club was playing French music - I wasn't really a fan of that. The food here was superb.  We had 3 different appetizers:  the crab claws, crab cake, and oyster rockefeller.  The crab claws were good, but I don't think they were worth the $68 my date paid for them.  We got 4 big crab claws full of crab meat.  The presentation was nice, but I wasn't crazy about them - they were a little overwhelming for me. The crab cakes were really good.  Our server, Nick, was nice enough to cut the crab cake in 3/4 for him, 1/4 for me (I didn't want to get too full), but first brought the crab cake to our table to show us the dish before he cut it.  He was a very professional server - it made our experience even more enjoyable.  The crab cake was definitely above par - it tasted very fresh and did not leave an after taste.   I had never had oysters rockefeller before.... they were HUMUNGOUS!!  We got 6 big oysters and they were probably the best appetizer we had.   My date ordered something off the ""features"" menu.  He had the Chilean Sea Bass with Prosciutto.  It was top notch - it was definitely an entree we would go back for. I had the filet medallions.  It was a little overcooked for my taste - I like my steak as rare as it can possibly be.  The manager and the server both came by to see if the new steak they brought out was to my satisfaction - it was perfect!!  It was very, very tender.  I almost didn't have to chew it - absolutely divine. We decided to have the chocolate cake (not the one with the toffee, although I'm sure we'll try that next time).  The chocolate cake was wonderful.  It was smooth, creamy, and had 5 or 6 layers.  Presentation was perfect.   After dinner, our server Nick dropped off the check and made small talk with us about our overall experience.  We both really appreciated it - it was nice to know that our opinion of the restaurant, as a whole, was important to him.   Our $275 check was not bad.  We had the above food and he had a beer, i had an Amaretto Stone Sour - both were also to our satisfaction.  I think for the money he spent, we both had a superb experience overall.  This is definitely one of my new favorite restaurants. I am giving it a 4 and not a 5 simply because the first table we were seated in was near a wall with, what felt like, 2 other couples on top of us.  I didn't feel like our conversation was private, but they were kind enough to move us to our own table with a view of the city, which was, again, very much appreciated.  There was also a loud table nearby, but I know that is not the restaurant's fault. Overall, I really enjoyed this restaurant.  I have been to the best restaurants in the city, and this is a new gem that will surely be around for many years to come.",0.9995,0.747,0.24,0.013,0.5283575683575682

The entrees were equally amazing-I rarely order risotto in restaurants as believe that they use shortcuts as time will not allow the attention a good risotto needs-this risotto was some of the best I had ever had!  The Branzino was also the best I had had anywhere-we wound up tasting each other's dishes and there was nothing that was not first rate-all exceeding our expectations.  Dessert did not disappoint with an amazing 5 or 6 layer chocolate cake, the biggest and tastiest profiteroles graced with the most delectable pistachio gelato, and then there was this decadent chocolate ""brownie"" adorned with a salty, tasty ""Carmel corn"" that should be sinful.

One of us actually had to send her meal back (the short rib) because it came out cold, and then could barely eat it because it was so fatty.",-0.0298,0.926,0.036,0.038,0.43281249999999993

Tonight we found a relatively new (7 months) world class Restuarant in Chicago.   Joe Fish came highly recommended by our hotel concierge.  It is the newest concept in the well established Chicago Rosebud Restaurant group.  It exceeded all expectations on all fronts.  Milo who took care of us all night made us feel like we were invited guest in his home enjoying family dinner.  That's extremely hard to pull off in a formal restaurant setting, especially with people meeting for the first time but he amazingly did it.  Give it a try and be sure to ask for Milo.

2014-10-06,3.0,"I was torn in writing this review as we really enjoyed our food but not the service.  My husband and I took my parents to this restaurant early on a Saturday. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant far away from other patrons and directly in front of the entrance to the kitchen. This also happened to be the place where all of the servers were hanging out. So while we were trying to talk to each other and review the menu, we had our server hovering over us constantly while an entire row of other servers basically stared us down. This made me so uncomfortable that I even suggested that we leave. Thankfully, the restaurant got a bit more busy and the servers stopped focusing quite so much on us, although the issue of people running by us constantly never stopped. I have to say that I have never experienced this before and I don't understand how servers would not realize how uncomfortable their stares and hovering makes patrons. I also don't understand why were seated all the way in the back right by the kitchen when it was 6:00 p.m. on a Saturday and the restaurant was less than half full. This definitely made us feel like second class citizens and we paid the same price as everyone else. On to the food. I got a really good soup (clam chowder, possibly) and the delicious lobster roll. My mom got a half-salad order with onion rings that she really enjoyed, as well as the lobster roll. My dad enjoyed his fish and chips, and my husband liked the salmon. In sum, the food was great but we're still not sure if we'll go back due to the service issues.",0.9838,0.805,0.136,0.059,0.49343033509700174

Joe Fish is not to be confused with Joe's Stone Crab because it's not quite THAT good, but still a good spot if you're a seafood lover like myself. I was a bit overwhelmed by all the delish sounding menu options. We ate here on a Monday night and after an indulgent weekend I didn't think I needed an entire entree...and opted for the crab cake appetizer for my meal. Perhaps not the smartest move since we also got a crab cake app for the table, but one can never have too many crab cakes IMO.  We also ordered a grilled calamari and chopped salad to start. The grilled calamari was incredible, but the chopped salad wasn't quite what I expected. It basically was a huge plate of onion rings with a side of salad...no thank you. The crab cake turned out to be quite satisfying, along with a side of brussel sprouts that I shared with my dining companions. Everyone else at the table ooh'd and ahh'd over their meals.. By the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed and couldn't possibly consider dessert, which I have no doubt would have been good. I was quite impressed with the service when we first sat down. However, after we got our meal our waiter went MIA on us and it took forever to get the check.  And speaking of the check this restaurant is quite pricey (entrees $40+).

The atmosphere was great and all the windows were open so it had a very breezy feel. Things started out poorly when the bartender poured me a glass of wine that looked small. I asked him about it so he said that he would show me that it was a full glass by pouring it into a separate measuring carafe.  Sure enough it was an inch short on the measuring glass. He returned the wine to my drinking glass and said it was a full glass because I had taken a sip. After I said ""really?"" he then put more wine in my glass. A bartender's personality shouldn't stop me from returning to a restaurant. But the poor service would. Our waitress was very nice and pleasant but we waited a long time after appetizers to get our dinner. By then we had to skip dessert in order to get to an event.

My entree--Chilean sea bass wrapped in prosciutto., accompanied with figs--was the highlight of the meal. The sea bass was well cooked and the prosciutto lent a nice flavor to the dish. I hesitate to judge my girlfriend's lobster roll, as I only tried a few bites, but my provisional verdict is that it was nothing special. Service was gracious. The decor is well done, integrating classic touches like red tufted chairs, without seeming dated.

I decided to give it another go this pass Friday and took my bestfriend here for a going away dinner. The service was definitely a lot better. Our waiter made various recommendations to us and was very pleasant.  For an appetizer we started with the Oyster Rockafellar. I had these last time and they are amazing!! For those that don't like raw oysters definitely give this a try. For my meal I ordered the Hanger Steak which came with a side of Lobster Mac and Cheese. This has got to be the best mac and cheese I have had in my entire life! Made to perfection!! My friend had the Shrimp Risotto and a side of spinich and brocolli which was also decent. There dessert potion size is ridiculous....lol. Defintely order one dessert to share. The elderly couple at the table next to us look like they were going to pass out from there huge slice of chocolate cake. I cannot think of the name of the dessert my friend and I ordered (picture below), but it was really good. Ice cream and chocolaty goodness. Can't go wrong. Now why does my review stay in the 3 star range.....pricing and ambience. For 2 people and no drinks our meal came to $134.00. That would be okay if this was a fancy restaurant, but just looking at the décor it's not. Those who are familiar with Long John silvers...that's sort of what it looks like. The décor is definitely not impressive. I also still find there seating in too close proxomity to other tables. I wouldn't mind paying that much money for elegance and a nice fancy dinner, but I don't see this place that way so you end up having a WTF moment when you get your check.

The staff was very friendly, although trying to present an air of prestige. Our server was immensely patient with us. I believe our entire stay was around three hours and there was about two hours between our appetizer order and our entrée order. We just wanted to take our time.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to start, they sounded so good. This also played a part in our long break in between courses. As a table we started with the Burrata. Holey moley, the portion of burrata is the size of an ostrich egg sitting on a bed of greens drizzled with a spicy olive oil surrounded by sliced peaches. The burrata was nicely done, firm on the outside and creamy on the inside. I was not a fan of the jalapenos and spicy olive oil. The flavors were too strong to be paired with a mild barrata. We also had the Brussels Sprouts (with the bacon on the side). This is also a healthy portion. There were enough flavors to sink through the large Sprouts, but a lot of salt.  To finish off our starters we had the Beefsteak Tomatoes salad. Not my thing as it comes with blue cheese. The others at the table devoured it. We also order the Jumbo Crab Cakes. This was not really a starter but two people at the table split the dish and it was perfect for the two of them. -insert about an hour or two of talking while we decide about entrees. I think this greatly confused our waiter and through the restaurant for a loop -  Finally on to our entrees, because we had filled up early we ordered two entrees for the table, the Wild Salmon and King Crab Legs. The salmon was nice. A bit overcooked for me (that's how the other at our table preferred it). It was also too juicy, if that makes sense. I like my salmon to be a little flaky with some seasoning on top. I felt like this salmon was wet. The Crab Legs were good. You do get all four split in half already (with the option of warm or cold) served with the drawn butter. A simple staple that's hard to do wrong. To close out our order we tried the Colossal Potato. And it's Colossal! I have not seen a larger potato in while. Enough to share between our four top. Given the huge portions and as much that we ordered dessert was not happening. We will have to go back. Overall, the portions are huge! You will not leave hungry. I enjoyed the more modern nautical themed décor.

A must have when I go back!  2. Mussels in a tomato?ish sauce. The mussels were good, taste was spot on. However, they were small and some were missing from its shell.

First they started us off with plentiful servings of the house Sauvingnon Blanc followed by a choice of white or red Sangria or 'a citrusy fish bowl punch'. I liked the white Sangria best. (I skipped the oysters.Not my thing.) The Mussels:  Generally I really don't like the rubbery/fishy little buggers, but I figured I'd give them a try. Well, these I liked! The tangy tomato sauce was a nice compliment to the tender morsels. If this is what mussels are supposed to be like, I need to have some more! The Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes:  These were the best item I tried this evening. The cakes were light and fluffy, filled with juicy crab meat, and topped with a tangy slaw that complimented the milder flavor of the cakes. There was a delicious dipping sauce on the side as well.  Beefsteak Tomatoes:  Hmm....they were tasty, but not quite up to the quality of the other items. I mean, blue cheese, bacon, onion ring and tomato go well together, but I don't think I'd order this on a second trip, yanno? Colossal Sea Scallops: Oh. My. Goodness. Amazingly tender, tasty and tangy, huge scallops accented with wild mushrooms over a perfect risotto. I am not ashamed to admit that I had two helpings.  Our waiter, Robert, was extremely helpful and took good care of us.  If you are a seafood fan, check them out. They prize quality and service highly here.",0.9977,0.709,0.27,0.021,0.5354947916666667
2014-07-17,5.0,"Joe Fish has so many good points it's difficult to know where to begin. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant it was clear that this isn't some run of the mill fish joint. Joe Fish is a high end restaurant with ""grown folks"" prices and a menu that includes such pricey fish as sea bass, Dover sole and sturgeon, also land meat and risotto. The average entree was priced at forty dollars, a bit much for my budget, but the food, ambiance, and service are well worth the price. Not long after we sat down, my party and I were served an amuse bouche: smoked sturgeon. As a preview for the rest of my meal, it tempted my palate and expressed, in a subtle way, the classiness of the restaurant. My party and I started our meal with salads. I ordered the lobster and avocado salad with a light lemon vinaigrette. As an appetizer the salad was a bit too large--I could have eaten it for a entree--but my group and I each ate some of it and loved it. We also ordered the brussel sprouts,a pleasing appetizer that we also ate as a side dish when our meals arrived. Joe Fish serves the freshest fish I've eaten in Chicago in some time. I ordered the marcona crusted sturgeon (a fish I had never eaten before) and was a bit taken aback by how large the entree was, so large in fact I couldn't finish it. The English peas I ordered for a side dish were crisp and flavored with oil and butter, served with small whole carrots and pearl onions. Hands down, Joe Fish gave be the best seafood meal I've eaten in a long time. Beyond the food, Joe Fish has much more to offer. The wait staff conduct themselves in a highly professional manner. Our waiter gave the impression of being a veteran server; he was knowledgeable, pleasant, authoritative and attentive. We watched with rapt attention as he de-boned a fish for a patron at the table next to ours. His deft skill was a treat, a bit of entertainment for us. The music in the restaurant, curiously, was recent R&B and pop tunes, but it infused energy into the atmosphere. The restaurant is tastefully decorated in polished wood and glass and is located just far enough away from the tourist traps and Millennial hang outs in Near North. Now, a few words of advice for potential patrons. Joe Fish is definitely not a restaurant for young children or large groups looking for a rowdy good time. Anyone who goes here and asks the waiter for tartar sauce will be met with dismissive eye rolling. Most patrons here are older and, in this reviewer's opinion, affluent. Anyone planning on having dinner here should dress up; this is not a jeans and flip flops joint. Even in khaki pants and a button down shirt I felt a bit under-dressed, but I liked the tony atmosphere and next time I dine here I will wear a tie. My only qualm with Joe Fish is the off pacing of the meal, which wasn't a big blunder by any means. I highly recommend Joe Fish for a fancy night out, a business dinner, or a special occasion.",0.9967,0.865,0.127,0.009,0.48618165784832457

We started with crab cake appetizer, which was huge and full of crab.  It tasted good, not fabulous.  The slaw that accompanied it reminded me of French dressing.  My husband (who rarely shares) had a salad with tomatoes, bacon, bleu cheese and onion rings. He loved it. Oysters were very good.  For main entrees, one person had lobster, shrimp risotto.  I was expecting it to be a white sauce, but it was red - very good.  Two of us had sea bass with figs, proscuttio  and marscapone cheese. It threw me that the figs were cold and the cheese not mixed with any other flavor. The bass was good, again - not great (definitely not worth $46.00). The waiter offered to put together a surf and turf which included medallions diane and mini lobster tails for the other person.  The steak was great (weird since this was a fish place). that was the best meal at the table. After filling up on the bread and appetizers we were too full to try desert. Nice atmosphere, about what you would expect in that area.  But way over priced for what we had. Might return in time to try something better priced.  I would give 3 stars for the food/value but gave 4 because of the staff.",0.9505,0.824,0.117,0.058,0.5528333333333334
2014-07-13,1.0,"I have a couple bones to pick with Mr. Joe. 1) Pacing of the meal.  It's so frustrating and dare I say aggravating when you're only part way through your appetizers, and the main courses arrive.  Total rookie mistake.  A gentleman who looked like a manager and a bus boy even had some issues rearranging the still-half-full plates on the table to make enough room for our lobster roll entrees.   2) Shell in my friend's lobster roll.  Another rookie mistake. 'Nuff said here. 3) Heaviness in the flavors of the food.  While the jumbo crabcake was extremely meaty and had high potential, the dill in it weighed the flavors down.  I wished for more lemon juice or citrus flavor to highlight the crab meat.  My lobster roll also had heavy flavors to it.  It was a bit too dressed in mayo-y sauce for me, and there was definitely honey in it that battled the fresh flavors I craved.  This entree is served with a couple sprigs of dill.  They really love their dill here!  FInally, even the white sangria with St. Germain and limoncello wasn't as light and refreshing as I anticipated.  A) There wasn't any chopped fruit in it, and B) the description had lemon strawberries written in it, but my friend and I didn't taste any strawberry whatsoever.  P.S.  The fries were so-so, a little heavy handed on whatever salt+seasoning combo they used.  If you dine here, do go for the mussels! Our waiter was friendly enough, but didn't seem to have a great handle of the menu.  While describing the specials for the night, he pretty much read off of my menu card.  He also mentioned how great the lobster roll was bc cold water lobster was prepared vs. Maine, but we found out later that night that those 2 things are one and the same.  As my friend C put it, ""what a crock of crap!""  It was also a bit of a wait before he finally greeted us after the hostess seated our party and bus girl filled our water cups... and it should only take 1 request to get some butter with our bread. Ambiance-wise, the restaurant feels touristy.  It must be something about the generic, uplifting pop, trendy colored decor, and/or large glass walls looking out onto Dearborn.  The good thing was I felt like I was on vacation!",0.9939,0.847,0.132,0.022,0.6233998283998282

2014-06-01,1.0,"A Sunday family brunch started with high hopes and excitement for a newly opened rosebud restaurant that we have been dying to try .  As soon as we set down it was quite apparent they were still working out the kinks. We ordered two of the same bloody marrys, when they were brought to the table one looked like a fruity cocktail and the other was mixed with heavy hand of tomato juice. Despite the inconsistently we were both disappointed with each one.  Meanwhile the staff was overwhelmed, as our server took 20 minutes to bring out two drinks, our server continued to disappear and we were unable to order until 30 minutes after we had sat down. Our order was simple, 1 salad, 1 bang bang biscuit and 4 cheeseburgers prepared medium  The bang bang biscuit came out first, with high expectations it was ordinary at best. I could have made one better myself. 45 minutes after receiving our biscuit, we asked our sever what the delay was for our burger, he said with an aloof attitude""everything is made from scratch"" he didn't seem to recognize that we had already been sitting for an hour and hadn't received our entree. He did not offer to check with the kitchen to find out what the problem was.  An hour and twenty minutes after we sat down our burgers came out.  Upon first bite the burgers crumbled the burgers were not just rare the meat was fully uncooked. They offered to re-fire the burgers but at that point the irritation had taken over our appetite.  The manager on site Yvonne was very apologetic and did offer to comp our entire meal. While we did appreciate the gesture the damage had already been done. It is safe to say we will not be returning.

I've been to most of Chicago's top restaurants.   However, there is not much skill or art in cooking a piece of halibut in lemon butter.  I don't think these types of preparations warrant these prices.  The Halibut was overcooked at the thin ends and okay in the thicker parts.  The sauce was okay, but sort of bland.  The crab cake was good, but not great. It was huge, but had more filler than you typically get at an upscale seafood restaurant.  The side of tartar sauce was uninspiring.   The service was fine, but seemed like it was all about upselling.   The decor is nice.

But when we aren't informed by the waiter that the portions are enormous, it's a backhanded way of up-selling in my opinion. Now to the nitty gritty: 1. They lost our reservation, despite receiving an email and a phone call reminder a few hours prior. Hostess asked if we would sit at the bar, we said no and they managed to get us a table asap. 2. Waiter - oh sigh - after 20+ years waiting tables, bartending and managing in the F&B world, you'd think that I wouldn't still see service like this. He was friendly - no question there, but was a bit condescending to three women guests. Assumed we didn't know about wine and suggested more than once to bring over the wine steward. That's ok - we got it covered. And was a bit pushy to get our order - interrupting us three times to get us rolling. Oh - and grabbed the paid check from the table as we were leaving. Seriously Dude - can't you wait until we leave and not seem so greedy? BTW we gave a 20% tip. 3. When the manager (?) - you'll love this - filleted a fish next to the table - the head flew off and landed on the table. And splattered a bit on my dining companion. Despite his horror, no recognition that he should make sure she didn't get splattered nor any offer of a glass of wine, dessert, just a little something in good faith of the flying fish head. And another waiter had to make a comment twice to us that it was funny.  4.

We sat at the a high top table at the bar and were immediately greeted with water and a friendly busboy. It took a few minutes too long for our server to come up, but was very friendly once he did. I ordered the blood orange mojito, craving something refreshing after a long work day and my friend got a dirty martini. Her martini wasn't quite dirty enough but was large and cold , so she was happy. My mojitio, while yummy and refreshing, was a bit sweet and did not taste like it included any alcohol. I switched to dirty martinis after.  We were offered bread service with olive oil, it was good. We then ordered mussels and the lobster salad for nibbling on. I'll say that the mussels were delicious and huge, dipping bread into the wine/tomato sauce was divine! The salad was quite good.-but not for the price, it tasted like it had bottled cocktail sauce on it and quite small.  My biggest draw back was that our server was all over the place, he was so busy flirty with old ladies at the other tables that we often had to ask for our next martini a few times before actually getting it.

I personally had ""The Hook"" which is made with Bulleit Rye, Batasiolo Chinato, Punt et Mes, Luxardo Maraschino, and equal parts delicious.  Before we even sat down we were greeted by the General Manager, Yvonne, who provide us with mouth watering descriptions of her favorite recommendations. We started with oysters, mussels and crab claws. For our main course we shared the Rack of Lamb, Risotto with Scallops and Chilean Sea Bass... none of which fell short of amazing. I was really craving seafood risotto and they possible served up the best I've ever had.  I absolutely loved this restaurant. The service is impossible to beat, the food never stops coming and the cocktail list is incredible. One of the things I enjoyed most is that they split up all the dishes among our group.

The food took forever to come out and we didn't get our appetizers until 9:30.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the oysters and the bang bang biscuits were ok, but a bit heavy.  I ordered the fried chicken special for dinner and was really disappointed by the large amount of dark meat.  It seemed they thought covering the chicken with breading would fool people into thinking they were eating white meat, not the case.  When we ordered a dessert we had seen served in the bar during our hour long wait, the waiter said they had sold out of it.   Our overall experience was pretty awful and the waiter never once apologized.  A manager came over with complimentary shots of lemoncello which although a nice gesture, two people in our party were pregnant and the rest didn't even want the drink.   With all the other options in River North, I won't be back to Joe Fish.",0.9142,0.843,0.098,0.059,0.5197892720306514

Then we shared the bang bang pie biscuits. Absolutely outstanding--a must have. For our meal we shared the ono crudo (perfectly seasoned and fresh) and the stripped bass and alaskan halibut.

And then, brussels sprouts.  Oh, I know.  Such a lame main course, even the waiter --a very nice, very attentive guy, was disappointed.  But really: After a dozen  oysters and a bottle of champagne, what more can you eat?  I can tell you:  10 brussels sprouts, which were damned near perfect.

2014-03-15,1.0,"This was the most frustrating restaurant experience I've had in a while. Started with bread.  It was meh.  Also had a bunch of appetizers for our group of 5.  The fun started there.  Of the two couples, one ordered 6 oysters -- ""chef's choice, all west coast.""  The other couple ordered 6 specific west coast oysters.  10 oysters were brought out (not 12), unceremoniously placed on the table without ANY explanation.  We had no idea whose were whose, what each oyster was, no explanation of what the chef had chosen for us.  We flagged down a waiter, who got us more oysters (but still no explanation).  6 oysters were brought, and we were only charged for 10, but still.  Frustrating.  Also, the waiter brought our friend one shrimp cocktail (like, one piece of shrimp) when he had clearly said five.  First off, NO BODY ordered one piece of shrimp in a cocktail.  No apology, no comp.   Then, the entree fiasco.  Everybody got their entree. . .  except for me.  The waiter came over, noticed I had no food, said, ""I will go check in the kitchen,"" and then immediately ran to the computer. . . not a good sign.  THREE TIMES different servers/managers came over to me and said that my food would be right out.  By the time it had come out, literally EVERY OTHER PERSON at the table had eaten their food.  One couple had brought their 1 year-old, and it would have been cruel to make him stick around and wait for me to eat.  I just had them pack it up and I brought it home.   In terms of the food, it was generally good, but not worth the money.  My neighbor had the scallop risotto which was incredibly over-salted.  My fiance had linguine which was good, but he hardly got to eat it because he mostly waited for my food.  The biscuit from Bang Bang was amazing (no surprise there!).   Overall, even with some things comped (my meal, some drinks, the oysters they brought after forgetting stuff), the meal came out to more than $100 per couple after comps.  It would have been more if they had not comped some things.  The mediocre food did not warrant that price tag.  Take my advice:  go to GT, go to Bow & Stern, go to Joe's Stonecrab.  DO NOT GO TO JOE FISH.  The service is terrible, the tables are cramped, and everything is WAY overpriced.  I hope they work out their kinks;  I almost started crying at the dinner table tonight--no one deserves that. 0 Stars! p.s. a few hours later and both my fiance and i have stomach aches.  also, the fact that they haven't been open very long is no excuse--go look at kinmont's reviews (too bad we couldn't get our first choice reservation there).  they haven't been open long at all and they've managed to put on a great service . . .  Also, to the reviewer who suggested we were looking for a ""handout""... if you actually read my review, you would see that we DID get things taken off our bill, and even with that the meal was too expensive to warrant the awful service.  We are more than happy to pay for good food and good service (see my other reviews).  This, unfortunately, just wasn't one of those occasions.",-0.988,0.808,0.062,0.13,0.5532539682539683

2014-03-11,4.0,"My husband and I walked into Joe's on opening night around 6 p.m. We were so happy that Joe's opened up on a corner spot in River North. The ambiance is elegant, with a trend as the chairs are of a turquoise blue color with gold accents. The crowd is older and sophisticated and the restaurant was getting filled as the evening went on. It's a nice, large space and I can see it becoming popular quite fairly soon.  Fully staffed and we got a lot of attention. We were greeted by the host and waitress immediately and choose to sit at the bar next to the beautiful window doors that will open up during the summer along with patio seating. For opening day, all the staff did their best. I ordered a mojito off of the cocktail list. It was crisp and refreshing with fresh mint leaves. The cocktail list looked creative with a diversity of drinks which I always appreciate.  We also got an oyster menu list, and after talking to our waitress, she suggested we can go with a chef's choice, so we ordered two and that was delicious. It came with minced onion and horseradish sauce and was presented beautifully. That was my favorite item of the evening. We also ordered pasta to share with a side order of roasted corn. Now this is where I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars. Perhaps they still need to perfect the menu. The pasta was al dente but the seasoning was so light and the basil had no taste. I understand that Joe's is known for their seafood at this restaurant, but I find it important that everything should be good. For 19 dollars, I could have ordered a cheaper pasta at RPM with higher quality taste. I forgive our waitress as she was new, and was learning how to split pasta's in two plate settings. However, she was learning next to us with another waitress and cleaning our plate with a towel to show good presentation of our plates. This should have been done in the kitchen.  It took a while for everything to get to to the table. The friendly manager, Yvonne Contreras, did greet us and apologized for the computer systems not working. All the food being put in was not all being sent to the kitchen. So we received everything late, and we received our corn with out the pasta. Roasted Corn- maybe it's become I prefer creamed corn, but this tasted so bland, including the veggies, even if it's a 'healthier' option, I would have much rather gotten mashed potatoes. I feel like it was filled with way to much sodium and tasted quite salty.  Overall, great place. I would efinately go badck for the Oysters and cocktails. I plan on going back again and ordering a larger dish.",0.9949,0.859,0.136,0.006,0.6366612554112554
