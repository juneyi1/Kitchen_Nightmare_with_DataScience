I could not have been happier with my choice. The pretzel was hot with a nice crust on the outside and almost fluffy inside and the mustard was a fantastic accompaniment to it. I had a beer rita on the side which packed a nice punch to it. My companion ordered the Pork and Chorizo Gordita with fries and could not even finish half so I gladly helped her out with that.

Their fried iems were very heavily breaded and just heavy and greasy...sort of what you'd expect if you were running your deep fryer at too low a temperature, or as is most likely considering how busy they were, just pushing too much product through for the fryer to recover it's temp. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to visit when they aren't so busy.

I had the SPF, a light Kolsch-style beer, which was kind of perfect for a hot end-of-summer day. There were several beers I'd never heard of. For this reason alone, I'd check it out. The food was mediocre at best. I'd probably skip that in the future. Soggy quesadilla and southwestern salad with too much dressing and overcooked chicken. Stop in here for one and then go out there and enjoy the rest of Wrigleyville madness.",0.8614,0.746,0.149,0.105,0.5080227743271221

Wednesday night game, we stopped in at about 5pm and our group of 8 was seated promptly.  Service was prompt but there were a few misses--like missing BEER. We were charged for beer that never made it to the table. Yeah, the check came even before some of our group got to get their last beer.  Unforgivable. Heh. The food was pretty good. I normally don't order chicken sandwiches because I find it too dried out for my liking. Not so here. My Buffalo chicken sandwich was really good. The chicken was moist and the buffalo sauce had a great kick. I asked for a side of truffle fries instead of regular fries and the truffle aoili was pretty tame. Not even close to my favorite truffle fries.   The beer was good. I normally don't order Goose Island when I'm out at a bar, but the Wrigleyville White was a perfect match for me.

2013-08-22,4.0,"This review is focused on private parties at this location. Our group rented out the top floor for NYE and had a great time. We've had NYE at Casey Moran, Mad River, and Red Ivy, and we collectively agree Goose Island threw the best party for our group. Pros: Everyone was able to buy their tickets online easily. We estimated the breakdown to be $75 pp given the size of our group to cover the rental fees, but we had enough people that Goose Island ended up making a lot of money on our group. We asked that the surplus went to our servers and bartenders. Check in went smoothly. Food was decent, nothing that fancy, but at least there was plenty of food. We could supply our own music, so one of our friends made a playlist that we loved. And bathrooms were on this floor, so we didn't have to walk up and down in our heels, which is a huge plus for me :)  Cons: Check in was supposed to be earlier for our group, but that didn't end up happening really. We didn't have a server, only a bar with two bartenders, but there was never that long of a wait, despite our group having 100 people in it. There was unfortunately not a lot of seating (because our group was so large) but they probably could've given us a few extra tables and chairs.

2013-08-22,3.0,"Hmmm this is a tough one as I'd like to give it a 3.5 in general... a 4 for the Wrigleyville area bar options.  Overall I like Goose Island..... I fully understand it's not a true Craft beer but a Crafty beer now as they sold out to a large producer that will remain unnamed.  Still their beers are pretty darn good when you get into their smaller batch stuff.  Like Sophie and Matilda... enjoy a Demolition on occasion and now with Greenline on tap at some places even the distributed stuff is darn good.  Hell I don't mind sucking down 312 when there are not many other options.  The nice part of going to their restaurants is that they have a bunch of other beers that they small batch out and do not sell on the market.  These are pretty solid beers and fun selections. If you are looking for good beer and want to avoid the beer swilling 20 somethings this is the bar to hit when going to a game.  It's a little more pricey than one of the other ones dishing out PBR and Bud in a bucket for a five spot but you can actually enjoy a good beer.  Currently they are serving up a bunch of IPA type beers.  My favorite at this time is The Illinois.  Think it's a darn good brew. FYI... The will fill Growlers for most of their beers on non-game days and they do not have to be the Goose Island Growler By the way... wants up with all these places now only filling their own growlers?  That's a load of BS... the growler is supposed to be a universal fill. Also since I'm on a complaining roll what's up with the North Ave Whole foods not filling growlers?  Man... every other state Whole Foods fills them which is pretty sweet... not here of course.. probably some BS from the city. Anyway again 3.5 overall, 4 or better for bars on game days, I'd return. Food is pretty darn good, decent burgers, pulled pork was good.  Like their pretzels if you are just looking for a snack... what's in that dip as it's a little addicitive.  Staff was pleasant as well.",0.9976,0.753,0.213,0.034,0.5486556527372853

I was excited to try the Berliner Weisse as I thought it would be similar to a beer I had in Germany. It was not what I was expecting. This had a strong, hard lemon taste that no one at our table enjoyed. I then tried the hard cider and found it a bit flat and lacking a developed flavor.  We tried the poutine which was okay. It was a bit salty and the cheese needed to be melted a bit. I shared the turkey burger with a friend. She thought it was fine, however I hated it due to a personal dislike of the peppers ground into the patty (and not mentioned on the menu). It came with made-in-house chips, also disappointing. They had a seasoning that tried to have a BBQ flavor but just did not work.  The positives: the fried pickles that had a little spice to them. My friends also enjoyed the green lime ale and the bourbon stout (warning that it is strong). There was a band playing in the back room. It took them awhile to figure out they needed to turn off the music in the main room so for awhile the two were competing.

I've also been told to try the Matilda the next time I go there (there will most certainly be a next time as well!) The beer was great! The duck sausage could definitely have packed in more flavor - however, it was decent. Nothing I can rant and rave about however. Everybody seemed to really like their burgers though. And the fries and onion rings were not soggy! That in itself gives it the extra 0.5 stars :) The service was also great but that could also be a result of going on a Monday night, as the place was pretty empty.

I was in town for the Roger Waters concert and my boyfriend and I decided to stop for dinner/drinks at Goose Island, having had a great time at the Clybourn location. I've been here once before, after a show, and it was a nice quiet night of good beer. This time, however, was much different. First of all, if you come on a game day or concert day, your beer is served in plastic cups. That may be okay for the run-of-the-mill beer like Miller or Bud, but for Goose Island beer, specially crafted and brewed, it really takes away from the experience. That may be the beer snob in me, but tasting special beers in an actual glass or chalice (Matilda FTW!) somehow makes it taste better. We asked the waitress if there was any way we could drink it in a glass and she said they wouldn't allow it. It sucks that people can't be trusted to use a real glass. We were also interested in getting a flight of beers since there were some new, seasonal beers on the list that looked interesting. Unfortunately, since it was a ""game day"" (concerts at Wrigley are considered game days), we could only get the game day flight and were not able to choose our own. That's a bummer, considering every Chicagoan has had a 312 so I don't need to know what that tastes like and also, there was a blueberry beer on the list. Blech. I'm not a fan of fruit beers so really, there would only be one beer on the flight I hadn't had (I think the other was Green Line). No substitutions allowed on game day flights. So we just ordered the beers we wanted to try and traded our beers with each other half way through. The food was good. A little pricey for bar fare, although I guess it is a slight step above bar fare.

2012-04-14,2.0,"I've really tried to like this place. I've been here a handful of times hoping it will be better than my last experience. It never is.  One time, I brought a couple of friends that were here visiting from Northern Ireland and Scotland and we decided to head to Goose Island for dinner and some drinks. My Scottish friend is a big hard cider fan. He didn't see hard cider on the drink menu, so he asked the waitress if they had hard cider. Miraculously, they did. The bottle of hard cider they brought him was as big as a wine bottle. The waitress never mentioned this. Whatever though. Maybe it slipped her mind. So me and my pals had a seemingly lovely dinner and all seemed rather normal. After we were done, we got the bill for our dinner, and that bottle of cider that was as big as a wine bottle was listed at thirty dollars! My friend that ordered it nearly shat himself. It would have been nice if the waitress had mentioned not only the size, but the price as well. Especially since it wasn't on the menu.  Another time, I went to Goose Island with my sister for lunch and drinks. They have recently changed their menu, and nothing on the menu seems appetizing. We placed an order of cheese curds as an appetizer. Right after ordering the appetizer, we ordered our main meal as well. I ordered the avocado turkey burger and said I wanted no onions on it (since the description said it came with onions on top). All seems normal. Me and my sister waited maybe 15 minutes, and finally our burgers came out. But what happened to our cheese curds? Our dumb waitress forgot to put the order in. Of course she was like, ""Oh I can put the order in now!"" No, that's ok. We have our burgers now. That defeats the entire purpose of an appetizer.  And now onto my turkey burger. It was disgusting. Luckily, the waitress got my order right. There were no onions on top of the burger. Unfortunately, the description in the menu, as well as the waitress, failed to mention that there are onions and peppers mixed into the ground turkey when they grill it. When I ordered the burger with no onions, maybe this should have clued the waitress into maybe letting me know that there are onions in the burger. I don't like onions, or green peppers. I think they are icky. I literally took two bites out of the burger and didn't touch it anymore and just ate the avocado.

2012-03-26,4.0,"As a craft beer nut, Goose Island Wrigley is my favorite bar on Clark Street. Despite being surrounded by average-at-best sports bars and overrated hotbeds for Wrigley nightlife, you can always come to Goose Island and actually have a quality drink with quality conversation in a place that's still buzzing. They have tons of space, even if a band is playing in the back room. They also have a nice big beer garden that's rather secluded and nice. Drink wise when I take out-of-towners here to show them they way of the Chicago beer scene, the flights are the way to go. They're affordable and allow people to sample a large portion of the beer menu. The rotating taps aren't quite as impressive as the Clybourn location, but they have some beers unique to Wrigley that make it worth your while. It's not some bastard child of the LP brew pub. I could go through all the staple beers, but the bottom line is there's something for everyone whether it's just 312 (three-one-two, for those planning to visit from out of town) or Green Line or one of the Belgian styles like Matilda or Sophie. I do want to take some time to compliment the menu, which has gotten significantly better since I moved down to the city a couple years ago. They added this killer brie grilled cheese back around Jan. 1 and the peanut butter burger actually does more than satisfy your bizarre curiosity. The LP brew pub still offers better all-around food, but this location has finally exceeded the uninspired standard for bar food quality on Clark Street. GI-Wrigley is a great place to catch a drink or to bring larger parties. I've gone to a number of birthday dinners or large-group meetups here and everyone enjoys themselves. The service has always been good and accommodating, but I did, however, have an issue with paying in a large party once. I don't know if they couldn't split the check or they couldn't split and do credit cards, but I had to use their ATM inside the bar. I wish I could remember exactly, but it obviously didn't bother me that much, just bring cash if you're going in a group. If you need a breather from the tumult of Clark Street bar-hopping or want an upper-echelon beer experience, Goose Island is the one and only answer.",0.9946,0.809,0.163,0.028,0.501438492063492

Four dollar cocktail menu - strong and, for the most part satisfying, if only a bit too sweet (the lemon wedge worked wonders however). Ample seating. The 'meh': Fried pickles - rather good, especially when paired with the sauce, but the amount of batter was disproportionate (let it drip for longer, chef!) and became greasy and soggy very quickly. The beer (Fleur)- I probably chose poorly as the hibiscus laden Rosa brewed at Revolution just can't be beaten. Fleur didn't live up to it. Duck macaroni and cheese - can't fault the chef - the duck was cooked beautifully and the sauce was rich...but there wasn't a lot of duck to be found. Disappointing.  The cons: Incredibly slow service - we went on a Monday afternoon (5ish) and the place was maybe a third filled. Server seemed very indifferent..maybe she was having a bad day?

2012-01-03,3.0,"Goose Island has been a staple in the Wrigleyville area for some time now; I have been an occasional customer here since moving to Chicago in the mid 1990s. While it is one of the better and more sophisticated bars near Wrigley Field, there are definitely several better options in the neighborhood if you wander away from the Wrigley strip. The beer is decent, but nothing to write home about. The Blueberry Ale (a seasonal brew) is my favorite offering when it is available. You can do a flight and try small portions of several of their brews if you are in the mood to try a variety. The food at Goose Island is pretty good for bar food; again nothing to write home about, but not at all bad. The menu features typical bar fare but also some more creative options (i.e. the Peanut Butter Burger) and some upscale options (i.e. the Duck Mac - homemade macaroni and cheese with duck confit). Some of the appetizers are pretty good; I enjoy their pretzel cheddar jalapeno stuffed pretzels as well as their nachos (they have a bread bowl filled with nacho cheese and then a generous serving of tortilla chips topped with beans, salsa, jalapenos and your choice of meat surround the bread bowl). While pricing is a bit higher than some of the nearby bars, the extra couple of dollars is worth it; also they sometimes run some decent specials as well as have  restaurant.com  certificates available. They also run a variety of events, including beer dinners at venues throughout Chicagoland.  Goose Island does have a nice beer garden for the few months Chicago weather is conducive to al fresco dining (or quaffing). There is also space for private parties or functions; the running club I belong to (CARA) frequently uses one of the room for events and Goose puts out a pretty nice spread for our post run grub.  In general though the interior of Goose Island is rather outdated and lacks ambiance.

It was crisp and refreshing - perfect for a 95 degree day at Wrigley. I would certainly come back here next time. The nice part about it is it's down a little from the hustle and bustle of Wrigley.

My husband and I enjoy beer and beer tasting and consider it a hobby. I was pretty excited to finally go to Goose Island but left extremely disappointed. Here's why: Menu- disappointing and overpriced. Food was mediocre. Nothing special about it.  Bartenders, except the one woman behind the regular bar, were not too helpful, seemed to be rushed (and they weren't too busy), not personable, very flat, and overall seemed bored to be there. The bartenders in the back where the band played were probably some of the worst that I have ever dealt with. I didn't even want to leave a tip.

2010-04-22,4.0,"""DUDE!  Was she even vote-able?""  I heard drunk guy ask other drunk guy in the restroom after mentioning how he'd love to ""give"" Sarah Palin another child. This kind of situation sums up why I avoid Wrigleyville but don't blame Goose Island for all the drunk jerkfaces that populate this place post-Cubs game. My somewhat high rating is based solely on two things here: 1.  The Beer - The main reason to come to any Goose Island establishment to drink their brews you can't get in the store.  This past time that meant the blueberry beer (not bad, it''s been better in previous incarnations) and the Demexieu (sp?) which is a dark Belgian style that is quite delicious.  I know you can get Bourbon County Stout anywhere but I'm a sucker for getting it on tap.  They also had something called Chicago Star which was a hoppy red ale but it wasn't my thing.  Still, I love coming here and knowing there will be new and different things to try. 2.  The Stilton Burger! - This thing is awesome and I think right now is the second best burger I've had in Chicago behind Kuma's.  Call that as preposterous as you want, but it is amazingly flavorful and if you don't feel like you could eat two of them because of how tasty they are, then you might be far too healthy for this sort of thing. A point off because the ""Fresh Veggies"" side is a bit misnamed, as ""Fresh"" apparently means ""sauteed in butter"" not to mention not much else on the menu really stood out to me.   Also, the service seemed fine.  Maybe because the full tidal wave of drunken melee that is the Cubs post-game hadn't fully broken over Wrigleyville just yet, the service was good.  The bartenders were attentive and very eager to get me more beer or help me out. If it weren't for the pluses, this place would be the forbidden zone.  It's hard to make a good case to come here given my disdain for the neighborhood, but honestly if you took this place and dropped it somewhere in the West Loop, Andersonville or Bucktown, I'd be all over it.  Consequently, the best times to come here are during the actual Cubs game (while everyone is at Wrigley Field) or during the winter.",0.994,0.772,0.163,0.065,0.5405128929041974

At such an off hour we got in and got a table right away. There barely was anyone else in the establishment so it was nice and quiet. The waitress was very friendly and came over to take our drink order. I told her what kind of beer I was looking for, and she recommend the 312 beer, which was very delicious. If you like Stella you will like 312, they are very similar. I personally love a buffalo chicken sandwich. The girlfriend actually makes fun of me because of how often I order it. In an effort to try and be a little bit healthier I have been asking people to make me one grilled instead of breaded and fried. Much to my surprise they actually offered it grilled on the menu. This meant I could get what I wanted without being that guy that asks for something not on the menu. The sandwich was a bit light on the buffalo sauce but the waitress very quickly brought over an extra side of it for me. The fries were also very delicious and were very plentiful. The girlfriend ordered the Beer Nachos which looked very delicious, although I did not really dive into them at all.

There were maybe three or four tables with people, so service was incredibly fast.

A bread bowl full of melted cheese for dipping.  Now, I regretted the meal after the fact (that much dairy? with all those beans? OY!), but while I was eating it man alive it was outstanding.

Our chocolate cake was served in a pasta/soup bowl and looked like a piece of cake on steroids! Seriously, they can't get much more than 4 slices from each cake. It was almost too big, good thing a few more friends joined us and helped us polish it off. The cake itself wasn't too bad, maybe a bit on the dry side.

My issue was with the food.  Totally unremarkable and some of it was just not good. The appetizers were only so so and we had plenty to try - wings, artichoke dip, quesadilla's, trio of dips, mini burgers, etc.  Of these- order the mini burgers as the rest are barely palatable and I usually like ""bar food"". As for entrees- I ordered the ""Pilson Burger"" which came with spiced melted cheese and sauteed onions and while huge- the burger was almost raw (ordered it medium),and the fries were cold and soggy.  Someone in our group ordered a trio of mini's and then ended up sending the spicy chicken ones back as the chicken was only a chicken strip which hardly filled the bun.  The good news?   It was replaced.  The bad news?  The person who ordered it had already left to see the start of the game by the time it arrived.

Never, ever go here on a game day, as the place will be overrun with loud, braying drunks.  To be perfectly honest, I'd avoid it for the entire season, as the beer selection changes to match the clientele.  That means that, during the season, the beers tend to be simpler, less aggressive, and in general less interesting.  During the winter, however, it seems that there is a bit more freedom and variety in the beers. The food is alright, though the burgers really shine.  My past experiences with the service has usually been pretty clipped and rushed, even on days and times when they aren't really busy.  A side effect of the neighborhood, maybe.

The pretzels might have been hand made by an angel because they were so light, fluffy, tasty and served with three sauces that made my mouth oh so happy.
