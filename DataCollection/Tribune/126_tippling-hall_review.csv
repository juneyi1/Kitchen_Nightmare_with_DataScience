They are located in the heart of River North and their food is amazing, especially for a place that's open so late(5AM!) The default place to go to is a Mexican restaurant or hamburger/hot dog spot but you'll quickly change your mind once you come here after a long night of partying on a Friday/Saturday night.  Their Cuban sandwiches, pizza and wings are very good. It's been a while since I've been to this place and as I'm writing this review I find out that they closed last October.

2015-09-21,1.0,"I love brunch, but my last visit to Tippling Hall was the worst brunch experience I've EVER had.  To be fair I'd been to Tippling Hall for brunch before, and while the kitchen was slow that day (think 1 hour wait for food), the large amounts of champagne along with the great waiter made up for it. This last trip though was such a terrible experience that I will never go back again.  We sat in the bar area and while it was crowded, it seemed like no one around us had food (not a good sign!). Tippling is known for their $29 deal (bottomless mimosas + entrée + baked good). It took us about 15 min. after sitting to put in a drink order, when those came we ordered, about 30 min. after sitting down. The waiter was inattentive, he refilled our glasses twice in 1.5 hours, and never came to check on us, nor did he ever come to tell us that our food was coming, or there was a back up in the kitchen, etc...  After waiting 90 mins. half of our table's food came. One girl had ordered the chicken and waffles and was surprised when the plate was set down with chicken and French toast. Upon asking we were told the kitchen ran out of waffle batter, but no one had come out to ask her if she would be ok with French toast or if she would prefer another item. Similarly, no one had received their baked goods that they are suppose to get as part of the meal. These are pastries that are already cooked so it makes no sense why they couldn't have been delivered much sooner than 90 minutes after ordering.  20 min. later the rest of the food came minus one person's entrée. Again neither the waiter nor the bus boys commented on the tardiness of the food, or the fact that half our table had finished by the time the other half received their food. The girl who still did not have her meal flagged down another waiter (ours was no where in sight) and asked if she could at least get the croissant she had ordered. 15 MINUTES later her croissant arrived. Throughout this time multiple tables of diners had left without ordering due to a lack of service, and it was clear the other tables around us were also getting frustrated.  My friend finally went and complained to the manager as it had been over two hours and she had not yet received her food (chilaquiles). The manager offered a variety of excuses, but eventually agreed to take half off the bill. Following this, our waiter suddenly appeared with a tray full of mimosas (""on the house"") ... umm we are paying for bottomless mimosas, so how are those on the house, and told my friend ""I was coming to tell you your food was coming, but you were talking to the manager."" .... sure sir after 40 minutes... I'm not buying it. Her food finally came and it was simply a bowl of chips with an egg and some salsa... not chilaquiles. Bottomline: the service was horrible, the food was mediocre, and the waiter and manager took no responsibility for the bad service. This last point was the most frustrating.  Don't go unless you can dedicate all day to your meal and you have the patience of a saint.  NEVER going back!",-0.9157,0.85,0.067,0.083,0.4233261183261183

2015-09-09,5.0,"Looking for brunch with class, sass and, well, let's be real: LOTS OF BOOZE, look no further than Tippling Hall. Generally speaking, when I go ""downtown"" for brunch, I expect to pay a little more and have a little bit of a fancier experience than my normal diner haunts in the greater Edgewater vicinity.  Tippling Hall is surprisingly affordable.  It's trendy.  The menu is elevated beyond omelettes.  And the best part?  They have an amazing brunch special of a pastry, a brunch main entree and bottomless mimosas all for $29. Say what?? And they're not stingy on the champagne. Awww yeah. Quite honestly, bottomless mimosas are enough to satiate me.  If I'm catching a buzz the food can be pretty mediocre.  However, everything at Tippling Hall was absolutely delicious.  Their main draw on the menu is build your own fritattas and build your own benedicts.  My gal pal and I decided to share and went with the lobster eggs benedict with sriracha hollandaise sauce and an order of the chicken and waffles.  They were both delicious.  I loved that the chicken and waffles came with arugula on top and a nice honey dressing to pour on top.  And how can you go wrong with lobster? I'm totally digging Tippling Hall. Pro tip: they take reservations for brunch.  That's #winning",0.9914,0.754,0.211,0.035,0.7084733893557423
2015-09-09,3.0,"Sat outside late on a Saturday afternoon - we were the only ones out there, so I was afraid we'd get slow service, and I was right. I ordered the Croque Madame, and while it was delicious and a monster serving, I do wish they'd indicated it would be served open face. My friend ordered the cauliflower fritters as an appetizer and the spicy pork sausage pizza as her main - they arrived at the same time, womp womp. For drinks, I had a glass of rose and my friend had two glasses of soda.  When the check came, my friend notices (and is appalled) that her $3.50 diet soda did not have free refills - so $7 for two glasses of soda. This didn't bother me much (easy to say that when it's not your money, I suppose!) but she was pretty irritated. When the waitress (finally) came to get the check, my friend said, ""So there aren't free refills on soda?"" The waitress replied, ""No - that's why I asked you if you wanted another one."" To be clear, that conversation went like this: Server: ""Would you like another soda, miss?"" Friend: ""Yes, please!"" Server: ""OK."" Come onnnnnnn - if your reason for asking if someone wants another soda is because you charge for refills, then just SAY SO! I actually think my friend would have switched to water if she'd known (although she probably didn't assume the glass of soda was $3.50, so who knows.) I was less bothered by the practice of charging for refills and more bothered by the lame ""well that's why we ask"" defense. Eesh. I'd probably come back if I ever get another craving for that Croque Madame (I took half home and it made a fantastic breakfast the next day) but my friend says she'll never return. Three stars just because that sammie was tasty - if my meal had been average, I would've given 'em two.",0.9848,0.792,0.149,0.059,0.5411740558292283

I find this extremely unprofessional because if I had a food allergy... well there goes that.  The salad portions were also paltry. Not exceptional in the least. It's so disappointing because I LOVED Tippling Hall during their Yelp Elite event, and the manager was super nice.  I just think the quality is so lacking now.

I guess if you're into super spicy food then this dish is for you! I got the Derek Smalls cocktail and was disappointed that it tasted like pure sugar syrup with some cucumber flavoring. The menu says it has lime juice, but there was no tartness whatsoever. I asked the waiter to bring me a lime wedge, so that helped.

I had whatever the current collins was on tap and was a little skeptical ordering it, but it was precisely what I was looking for without even knowing (I'm typically a gin drinker and it was made with plain vodka [this bitch needs her juniper,] but what the fuck do I care, it was refreshing and thirst quenching, and I absolutely loved it.) the only negative was how unbearably loud it was with the dj spinning. it was a saturday and all, which automatically means you sign up for an evening of strained eardrums wherever you go, but not being able to have even minor chitchat (dear god, what a horrible term,) with someone 2 inches from your face kinda blows. let it be stated though... the music was enjoyable at the very least. also, for non-Chicagoans, Malört is the devil's seed, don't let anyone try and tell you otherwise.",-0.7659,0.755,0.11,0.135,0.6383509700176369
2015-07-27,5.0,"Such a solid brunch spot!  For some reason I didn't have too high of expectations coming here - a friend was giving us a list of brunch places and only mentioned how good the booze/brunch special was. She said another restaurant was better known for their food. I shouldn't have listened at ALL, because the booze and the grub and the service and the atmosphere were all 100%. I really don't know why it wasn't jam packed at 11am on a Sunday - maybe because it's in the Loop and not a more neighborhood-like place?  Anyway. They do a $29 special that gives you unlimited mimosas, a choice of pastry and an entree $15 or under. A very solid option if you like mimosas, which I do, but i tend to not choose them if the Bloody Mary's are good. Our waitress assured me they were worth it, and their menu that had 6 variations with different alcohols also convinced me. It. Was. Out. Of. This. World. My drink arrived in a glass (really more like a bowl) CHOCK FULL of bacon (probably 2.5 slices worth) with a skewer of olives, cilantro, hot peppers, cucumber and a giant pickle. I do want to try one of those bloody Mary's with a mini slider on top one day, but the mass of veggies plus bacon was totally fine by me. It had an excellent flavor as well, mildly spicy, somewhat accented by the cilantro and just deeply tomato-y and delicious. It's really a health drink if you look at it. (Ha!)  If that wasn't enough to sell me (spoiler: it was) their brunch menu was spot on, with build your own frittatas and Benedicts. I chose the crab Benedict with Old Bay Hollandaise (?!) and it was delicious. My friend got the fried egg sandwich which also looked amazing and I had my eye on their croque Madame, their frittatas and the classic brunchy shrimp and grits. I'm sure it was all amazing. It was on the pricier side, but I really didn't care. Our waitress was nice - and allowed me to geek out with her over the bloody and the food - and was pretty attentive.

The bartender makes a lively Moscow Mule, but didn't serve it in a copper mug, which is half the fun of drinking a mule.  Please don't skimp on the important details. The chef is of the belief that just because it's on the menu, doesn't give you the right to expect it on your plate.  Apparently, ""Chicken chipotle salad on a brioche bun"" means chicken chipotle salad on whatever vehicle we have laying around.  When it arrived on a croissant and I questioned the mix up I was told that I was wrong.  Well, I went back and checked the menu...I was RIGHT.  Considering the extremely limited brunch menu, you'd think they would be able to get every item correct.  A Brioche bun and a croissant are not the same thing, chef.  I suggest you spend a little more time studying your own menu. Finally, feel free to make a reservation but don't be surprised when they give it away.  They have no problem taking reservations...it's the holding part they can't seem to grasp.  Which is really the most important part.  Just ask Seinfeld.",0.7522,0.824,0.099,0.077,0.6286535303776684

The banana cream dessert- rich, but not too sweet, and lots of toppings.  Didn't exactly travel well, but we put in the freezer for a bit and it was very good.  Would order again.  Big portion. The okay but forgettable: Carnitas Sandwich- big portion, hubby liked it.  I didn't get much meat on my half, thought the mashed potatoes on it were a little weird/unflavorul.  A little greasy. Fries were pretty good. Maybe would try again. Salmon:  Okay, a little fishy. Calamari- the salad with mint was nice and the plantains were good.  Really small portion of actual squid.  For the price, they could have been more generous. The bad: Read the reviews about the dates. Ordered said dates.  Received 4 dates for 9.5 - thought that was pretty ridic.  The sauce was an odd pairing. I mean I get they're trying to add some spice to a relatively sweet dish, but bleh. Wouldn't order again. Duck Empanadas- again smallish portion and they were gamey. Didn't care for the guava sauce which I initially was very excited about.  Wouldn't order again.",0.9896,0.731,0.199,0.071,0.489551282051282

Her fellow bartender was equally as pleasant even in the short time we spent at the bar.  The event we attended truly displayed all the great qualities of the place. We experienced several of their unique cocktails as well as some of their signature food items.  I'm always skeptical in writing reviews for planned events as you'd expect everyone to be at their best, however, too often, that's not the case. In this instance, the manager was visible & approchable & clearly had a well managed staff that needed no direction & was prepared for the event at hand.

2015-03-02,5.0,"5/5 for drinks and I feel they're even likely to convert cocktail shunners. They're adequately strong and you could taste the liqueur or bitters in them without it overpowering the flavour of the fruit-base...just from lurking the menu I think I'll have to go back and try the 5+ bloody mary's they have.  ""Big Nose Get's Lei'd"" came out magenta and I anticipated a berry flavor but apparently contained melon rum with grapefruit bitters. It had a strong pineapple flavor and was the hardest to finish of the three drinks I had as it came in a big glass. The least memorable was ""BBQ Daisy"" which was slightly spicy and smokey and citrusy, the taste was neither here nor there between lemon and something like barbecue sauce?! I imagine I'd have a scotch if I wanted something smokey. anyway, the cucumber Martini was definitely hands-down the most soothing and deceptive. I was told it's usually served on the rocks. The delicate mushroom/truffle phyllo pastry bites and arugula pizza flatbread that came around as hors d'oeuvres were amazing too. I would say the pear and blue cheese flatbread was the winner.

Then the parade of food and cocktails began!  We loved the music, the atmosphere, and the service was fantastic!  They started with peppers which everyone loved, and some guac that had goat cheese in it.  I would have never thought about adding goat cheese to guac but it worked!  Then we had a pickled deviled egg that had smoked salmon (I think).  I thought it was just ok but I was the minority.  The 2 salads arrived.  A classic Caesar which was fine only b/c the winter salad was amazing.  We couldn't get enough of it.  Then they brought 2 pizzas and it was fair for the 2 people with food restrictions.  It was shrimp and the other was bacon.  Everyone was nuts for the bacon pizza.  I had the shrimp which was awesome.  A little spice but not too much.  Then....the chicken pot pie that stopped time.  We were dying!  It was so delicious!!  It was this savory, gooey, goodness with a flaky crust on top.  Not like other pies with chunks of veg and chicken, this was shredded.  Yummy!  The next time I need some comfort food I'm coming for that pie.  Then for mains it was fried chicken which was ok.  Compared to the chicken I've had lately it was unfair.  This chicken is a cornmeal crust and nice and juicy inside.  Also the meat people had a big Fred Flintstone style short rib.  Some loved it and some thought it was just ok.  By now I'm ready to throw in the towel.  That's a lot of food!!  Oh btw the cocktails are inventive and very good.  Their beverage menu is very impressive.  We tried just about everything from the tap to craft cocktails.  I loved the deep dish Manhattan and at the end I went for a Sazerac.  It was perfect.  The dessert came and it was 3 deep dish chocolate chip cookies covered in candied bacon.  I was disappointed because I could not try any of it.  Dessert is my thing!  I wonder why 1 of the 3 cookies was served sans meat.  But it was not their best.  They tell me the cookie was a little dry.  People at the ice cream and bacon off of it.  They loved the bacon.  My cocktail was my dessert.  All of this food was $40 PP.  An excellent deal and a great time!  I'm coming back for more pot pie.",0.9989,0.769,0.194,0.038,0.612128205128205

What I really like about this place is that they serve beer in 8oz glasses at the same price as a pint which gives you a chance to try a few more beers on tap.,0.0639,0.843,0.087,0.071,0.2981292517006803

It was so tasty, in fact, I didn't stray from it all night. In total, I took down 3 of those bad boys! My date had a few beers.  We also shared an order of deviled eggs. Again, tasty!

After months of waiting, I was excited to finally visit Tippling Hall.  The drinks do not disappoint and are the main reason this will be one of your favorite places. They even imported 'The Crippler,' which itself is famous. Except for the appetizers (expensive for what you get), the food also does not disappoint; although, the heavy comfort food is probably better suited for brunch than a night out on the town. Service was also great. While the beer list is decent, many options were unavailable during our visit, which is unacceptable. In addition, it appears they did no work to bathrooms, which seem to be untouched since the old Hop Haus days. The music is also terrible (even for River North) as both Journey and Black Eyed Peas were played during our visit.",0.9624,0.791,0.163,0.047,0.6833333333333332

2014-12-16,3.0,"Tippling Hall's proximity to my office has made it a fairly regular place in my rotation since it opened 6-8 weeks ago.  They sell themselves as a cocktail bar but the cocktails are the biggest qualm I have with this place. I've tried 5-6 of them now and have yet to find one that I LOVE, which I think you really need to for the prices they're charging for their inventive cocktails. I will probably stick with beer next time I go but it seems to be a shame for a place that has a crazy huge cocktail menu.  Despite my issues with Tippling's beverage program I do really enjoy their food. I've sampled a bunch of different dishes on my visits there and haven't been disappointed thus far. Their huge potato menu is amazing and the smashed fingerling potatoes are ridiculously rich and totally out of this world.  Other stand outs for me have been the bacon wrapped dates, adult chocolate chip cookie, and beer cheese fondue. I will say I am not in love with their flatbreads after having sampled two of them and would highly recommend staying away from them as there are way better choices on their ample menu.  While I do not dislike Tippling the price point and the beverages have not hit the mark for me compared to other nearby establishments. I'm sure I'll be back but I think this place has some work to do it if hopes to compete with the other restaurants in the area.",0.9882,0.779,0.168,0.052,0.5742004985754986

The inside of Tippling Hall is beautiful and I love what they did with having a separation between the large bar area and the restaurant part.  Even sitting by the door did not prove to be cold either with everyone coming in.   The service was okay and left a little to be desired, but at the end we discovered that our waiter had tables in both the restaurant and the bar area.  I don't think they should do that b/c getting to and from the bar area when it's crowded is hard and since it's a separate area, it's hard to always see your waiter if you need something.  For example - I would have liked another drink, but he was no where to be found to ask him.  And by the time I did see him, I was done eating. Food wise - it was lack luster.  There was a problem with my order in that I wanted two of the appetizers served as my meal, but the kitchen messed up and brought them out early.  The manager did come over and apologize, but still.  I finished eating and then my husband's meal came out.  It was just a tad awkward. We had the Lamb meatballs, Twice baked Trio Potatoes and the Torta.  All were okay - but nothing great that would make me order them again.  For dessert, we got the adult chocolate chip cookie.  My husband actually did not like the cookie at all - which says something since he loves cookies.  I thought it was fine - but more doughy than is usual.

I was greeted at the door by a very nice hostess who told me my friend was already there and at the bar.  She also was super accommodating when we asked if we could linger over cocktails before moving to our table (of course I would never have done this if it hadn't been early on a Tuesday night).  We also were greeted by two of the partners during our visit and Paul even checked back in with us after dinner to see how everything worked out. The bartender, Joshua, was terrific!  Quick with a drink or a witticism, he really made  our night- so much so that when we were done with dinner- it was back to his bar we went! Like other places owned by this team, there are cocktails on tap made with fresh juices and spirits.  We tried the BBQ Daisy (like a spicy margarita) and the Alice Fey (vodka and beer concoction) and both were good. As for our food- the menu is eclectic and broken into starters , shareables and main entrees.  We started with some pickled deviled eggs and the saganaki (see?  I told you the menu was eclectic!)  The eggs were quite good while the saganaki left a little to be desired as it was a little thick and chewy, like it needed to be flamed a little longer. For our entrees- I had the Caesar salad that I added chicken to, and my friend had the Fluke based on our server, Angela's, recco.  Well, she was right on!  the fluke with it's Asian inspired preparation was very tasty! Now while my friend REALLY wanted to go with the hot skillet cookie for dessert, he refrained (my hips thank him!) but I know we will be back for this decadent treat! So if you are still thinking Hop Haus décor, think that no more.  Gone is the disco dance floor, replaced by a beautiful bar area and very interesting looking bar.  Artwork hangs from the ceiling and walls and the exposed beams just make the place feel warm and comfortable.  And even the long journey to the restroom (okay- so they couldn't change that!) is made fun my following the wall graphics pointing you in the right direction! And I  don't know who's playlist they were playing on the night we were there, but it's like they took my ""favorites"" and played them all night!  Lots of 80's and 90's rock, perfect for us to hum along with! If you drive- for now- there is street parking, and lots across the street.  No valet yet but it could be easy enough with Spy Bar next door.   But the one thing they did keep from Hoop Haus is the 4am bar license.  Nice.  Now there's another place to have that last cocktail before calling it a night. Love it when a plan comes together and it's clear that Tippling Hall had a terrifically executed plan!",0.9975,0.819,0.163,0.019,0.4827502429543246
2014-10-23,4.0,"Perhaps it was the $20 liter of house wine that swayed our opinion, but whatever, we'll absolutely come back to Tippling Hall.  The spicy mussels are in an amazing sauce but the shellfish themselves could have been fresher - many didn't open fully and they tasted slightly fishy, but I will definitely try them again because the sauce is the boss! If the shell fish were more spot on I would have given the restaurant 5 stars.  The bacon wrapped dates were in a sauce unlike any I've had before with bacon wrapped dates and I loved it! But the dates are very small and they should give you six, not five. The Baked Ratatouille was very good but it was really roasted, diced root veggies, not the saucier stew version of ratatouille I'm used to, but I'll definitely order it again.",0.9764,0.853,0.147,0.0,0.5205128205128206
2014-10-23,4.0,"Three weeks in, and love it, no issues. Vibrant, hip, loud, but great welcoming service and tasty food! Can't wait to go back.  We were an hour late for our reservation but the staff welcomed us and sat us right away! Our waiter was the bomb! We were so hungry and after looking at the starters for two seconds we knew what we wanted. Boom, done. We started with the Deviled Eggs and Shishito Peppers. He brought them out within a couple minutes of our order. Ahhhh, now we could relax and take in the rest of the menu with it's cute tongue and cheek stories and interjections.  I love the menu with the around the world flair. You can order Deviled Eggs, to Saganaki to start. There are flat-breads and pasta and fish and salads and potatoes.  The Deviled Eggs were great. You get two, so four halves for you math wizards. The pickled tangyness is balanced by the salmon and dill. The Shishito Peppers are fun to eat, a bit spicy for me but I am a true Anglo from the cold north, so what do I know about spicy? We then went with the crab cake. A great size, warm, with wonderful color green pablano cream, not spicy, creamy and complements the crab.  Next up we had the Main Lobster and Black Papparadelle pasta. The sauce was a bit salty for me. It felt like I was eating something similar to a beef stroganoff. Regardless, it's a great portion if you are hungry or want to share.  We wanted to order so many more items, but did not have the stomach space. So, we tried the adult cookie for dessert. Standard, warm goody, rich and filling with the delightful ice cream on top. Great way to end the evening.  Cannot wait to go try some more items and their crazy interesting drink menu. Wine by the inch, so glad a place in Chicago is finally do this. Plus check out their other drink items/customs from around the world.",0.9984,0.712,0.252,0.036,0.5827220077220078
2014-10-22,4.0,"I just got home from Tippling Hall and apparently it was good enough for me to rush to my computer and post my... first... yelp review... ever.  First shout out goes to the FoH manager (I'm so sorry I can't remember your name, ex-immigrations paralegal).  He was so warm and welcoming and stopped by our table a couple of times to chat.  I'd go back just to see him.  The ambiance is extremely cozy *and* industrial.  I don't know how they pulled off the balance and I'm not even going to ask.  Just keep doing it, Tippling Hall.  Semi-Charmed Life filled the room as soon as I sat down at my table and I can't even argue with that (full disclosure: I'm ride or die 3eb, so), and the soundtrack was overarchingly 90s.  Like, from Hootie and the Blowfish to MA$E.  Good. I tried every draft cocktail and the Derek Smalls, and the bacon wrapped dates.  TH does a nice twist on the dates by using Manchego instead of goat cheese, and I will hat tip to that.  Just make sure you eat them while they're still warm to get the full effect ;)  All of the draft cocktails were delicious, honestly, and I wasn't expecting that.  If you're into Manhattans, the Deep Dish is a must-try.  The hint of malort is like that unexpected trick in bed that you never thought you'd be into, but now that you've had it, well....  And the BBQ Daisy was the winner.  I was warned *twice* that it was spicy, but the kick was pretty marginal.  Don't be afraid.  The one downfall was slow service.  Our *actual* waitress showed up fewer times than the FoH manager (I'm willing to write this off since overall we were wonderfully accommodated) , and her timing was a little off.  She was very sweet and had a beautiful smile -- which goes far in River North, ""lol"" -- but it took a solid 15 minutes to get the first round of draft [read: PRE-MIXED] cocktails even before the place filled up.   The crowd was beautiful and eclectic, but not intimidating.  Really lively environment and good vibes.  I'll definitely be back -- can't wait to try out more of the menu!",0.9952,0.799,0.171,0.03,0.6084722222222222
2014-10-21,5.0,"Fantastic addition to the River North. Visited this place with a few of my friends and could not of been more pleased. Such a warm welcome from the staff upon entering and the place has a great ambience. I mean, seriously... What's not to love about a chandelier flask entrance? I had to refrain from stealing one for myself. For cocktails, it was a tough decision, as all their cocktails look phenomenal! I tried the Curly and the Turk and it was so bomb!! I hate gin, but this drink made me love it. Also, they make probably one of the BEST manhattans I've ever had in Chicago. If you're a bourbon drinker, don't skip the Deep Dish Manhattan here!  Food: We started with the bacon wrapped dates which were, no doubt, the best I've ever had. For apps, we ordered the crab cake and the smoked chipotle hummus. Both, full of so much flavor. This is not your average hummus and it surpassed my expectations. Would of liked it more if it was served with veggies though.  On to dinner: We all shared the Lobster Papardelle Pasta, Chicken Tangine, Fried Chicken, and Salmon. It was more than enough food for us and each dish was better than the next. My personal favorite was the Chicken Tangine. It had a unique Moroccan flavor to it and literally melts in your mouth. It's not something you normally see done at other restaurants and is amazing!  Our server, she recommended great items and was really on top of it. If you're looking for a fun new place to check out in the River North I highly suggest Tippling Hall! Oh and did I mention this place serves food til 4 am? No more Bijan's for me. Thanks TIppling Hall!",0.9928,0.74,0.19,0.07,0.5862103594080338

I will be back to eat some real food as everything looked amazing. Don't get lost going to the bathroom though..",0.9542,0.78,0.2,0.02,0.4621212121212121
2014-10-20,5.0,"With the endless amounts of restaurants and bars in the River North area, this place sets itself apart. The staff is very warm and welcoming, not pretentious at all.  I've never been to a place that serves such a large variety of cuisines. My friends and I shared the: deviled eggs, spicy mussels, tarte flambé flatbread, double cut pork chop, chicken pot pie, and the roasted corn. Everything was amazing! My favorites were the chicken pot pie and deviled eggs.  The drink list is super fun and filled with lots of cheeky quotes and messages. Lots of creative cocktails. I loved their deep dish Manhattan. And they have 18oz ""big ass marys"", like it's literally called big ass marys. Lol, I'm coming back to try those next time.  The decor is totally my vibe! It has an industrial look, lots of wood and metals, graffiti and cool signs all over the walls.  Oh, and the best part, my friends and I were there til 4am, YES they're open late. Every. Day. All in all, I think I've found my new favorite hang out.",0.9899,0.696,0.24,0.064,0.5585105018438353
2014-10-20,5.0,"Okay, so let me start by saying I was very wary of this place at first when I found out they served draft cocktails. I've had them elsewhere and wasn't a fan. But let me say, Tippling Hall does an outstanding job! The Alice Fay was my favorite. It's served with a piece of pecan brittle that you will definitely want more of. The drink itself is very unique as well. Beer, vodka and pecan syrup. YUM! The other draft cocktail I tried was the BBQ Daisy. Kind of a smoky margarita and also amazing! I had the One Sour Samurai, which isn't a draft cocktail. It was SO good. Seriously could drink those all night. I couldn't get enough! As far as the food goes, I usually keep it light when I'm out with friends. We had the guacamole, pickled deviled eggs, the crabcake, and the shishito peppers. All were great! I'm a fan of adding cheese to anything, but the goat cheese to the guacamole was unexpected and amazing! Pickled deviled eggs were one of my favorites. Light, smoky, and creamy. You could really taste each and every ingredient in them, too. What more could you ask for?!  The crabcake was great. Not jumbo lump crab, so it's easy to split and you still get a large amount of crab meat! Loved the poblano sauce. Would have liked the cauliflower to be more caramelized though.  The shishito peppers had great flavor and were nicely charred.  All in all, I was very pleased when I left. Will be back very soon for entrees and hopefully their adult chocolate cookie dessert (that is if I can save enough room)! Great environment and service. Lots of smiles from everyone who worked there. And the music was great! I can see this place becoming a regular hangout for sure!",0.9979,0.724,0.248,0.028,0.6264585285515518

Their cocktails are amazing - we tried 6 different ones amongst the 4 of us and not a single one disappointed! They were mixed well!  The appetizers we tried - pretzels, guacamole, hummus - were all good!  The entrees - sandwiches, steak, tajine, salads - were also really well flavored, good sized, and satisfying! The panini is the only thing I've had hear that I wasn't turned into a fan with.  Their skillet cookie is so yummy! The concept of cuisines from around the world gets taking used to. Also, paying those prices for comfort food.  But one of my favorite new openings in Chicago!",0.9931,0.67,0.314,0.016,0.6454906204906206
2014-10-19,1.0,"Two main points: 1. Horrible service. My girlfriend and I arrived just before 10:30pm, and promptly found an open table in the bar area. We chose to do the wine by the inch deal but it never came. At exactly 11pm, we left because it had been 30 minutes and we had yet to have a drink. That is not acceptable service. 2. Spybar's music makes everything vibrate. When we sat down, we immediately felt the seat and floor vibrating. It was funny at first but quickly became annoying. You can also feel it when standing but it's less pronounced.",-0.5256,0.886,0.036,0.078,0.47020202020202023
2014-10-18,4.0,"Absolutely wonderful food. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's loud.  We have been waiting for months for Tippling Hall to open and it surpassed my expectations. We started with some craft beverages which were good and unusual. We moved on to a tasty fondue and a delicious crab cake (split between two people). Then my wife and I shared two entrees, the half order of the fried chicken which came with a corn muffin and the beef short ribs served with mashed potatoes. All were absolutely delicious. The beef short ribs were the best I've had in many years and is similar to the Charlie Trotters recipe I have except that they added mushrooms to the sauce which makes them even better. It was too much food and we planned to bring the rest home and I was looking forward to the leftovers. Unfortunately my dining companions eventually snarfed it down, it was just too good.  Tim the waiter deserves a shout out for doing a great job. It was loud but we will definitely be back. A great addition to the River North food scene.",0.9761,0.845,0.146,0.009,0.6127314814814816
