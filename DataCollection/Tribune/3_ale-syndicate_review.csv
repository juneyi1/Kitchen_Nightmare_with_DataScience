2016-02-21,5.0,"We bought the Groupon deal for a brewery tour, tasting, and a pint glass. The tour was informative and didn't drag on like some tours I have been on. Really good beer and they mentioned they'll be getting a tap room soon. I'll be back!",0.4662,0.84,0.114,0.047,0.22361111111111112
2014-07-12,4.0,"On a recent trip to Chicago I encountered two of this promising production brewery's products: -Omega Midnight Foreign Extra Stout (at Kuma's Corner).  9.5% ABV.  Opaque, full-flavored, with ethanol as a definite flavor element.  Rather pricy at Kuma's, at $20 for a 750-ml bottle. -Van de Velde Belgo Pale Ale (at South Water Kitchen).  6.5% ABV.  A nice golden ale, with sweetish malt against a rather un-Belgian hoppiness.  At South Water, $3 for a good-sized draft sampler. So far, they do not have a taproom or offer public tours, though there are future plans in this direction.  Their website has current information on availability of their brews.",0.8283,0.907,0.093,0.0,0.3955555555555556
