2015-05-28,4.0,"Trellis never disappoints -- the atmosphere is lively and fun, the food is comforting and delicious, and the wine flights are, well, wine flights :) Most recently, I went with friends on a weeknight -- we split a bottle of pinot noir and shared the jamon pizza. I have had the cuban breakfast pizza before, so when ordering the jamon pizza, I knew it would be good. The crust is light and thin, but holds the heavy jamon/cheese/arugula well. The bright spot of this dish is the pickled shallot -- it gives the perfect contrast to the jamon and cheese, tying it together with the arugula.  Another friend ordered the roasted duck on brioche. The duck was juicy and perfectly complemented by the jam on the sandwich.  But, if there's one takeaway, it's the wine flights. Do a wine flight, you won't regret it.",0.9904,0.736,0.264,0.0,0.6846153846153847

The venue and location is part of the charm here, so Trellis has that going for it. I came with a friend and we sat at the bar. Service was friendly and fast throughout the evening, and drinks were strong. Trellis has the potential to get pretty loud, but not as bad as some spots in LP. The menu has so many good options. The Frites looked yummy but I resisted. PIzzas were tempting me as well. My buddy ordered the Fig Jam & Bacon Pizza which looked amazing and he really liked it. The pizza was not super large and he was able to finish it alone with no help, unfortunately for me. I ordered the Roasted Chicken Salad with Little Gem lettuce, cranberry, artichoke, and pickled shallots. I never tasted or saw any artichokes in my salad. Instead, it came out with mini heirloom tomatoes and shaved crunchy bacon strips. Not a bad thing taste-wise, but bad for my diet! I got the herbed creamy dressing on the side and it was yummy, but very rich. They should update the description of the salad on their menu in my opinion. That was my only issue with it. For drinks my friend went with a few of the signature cocktails, which he loved and I stuck with the tried and true V&S. We rung out at just over $30 a person.

I always delighted in the well priced ""big bottomed"" mimosas and the tasty brunch pizzas and oysters, but was so happy to come back recently and find that they've been perfecting the menu. They've kept all my favorites and gotten rid of some weak items, and added some new awesome dishes. Highlights: sweet and savory skillet, jalapeño and fontagio biscuits and gravy, and the iberico ham pizza. The charcuterie/cheese options are also amazing. If you're not in the mood for getting down with your economical self on the mims, the bloody is also excellent, and they have a solid beer list. All around one of four corners' biggest wins, in my opinion.

2014-12-22,3.0,"In one day,several people asked me if I had been to Trellis yet.  So what's a girl to do?  I cancelled another reservation I had that evening and headed over to Trellis. This is a "" re do"" of the old Gaslight bar so the space is basically unchanged, with the bar in the front and more seating in the back. We were seated promptly for our reservation and began to look over the menu.  While my friends had said the food and service was stellar, we found both to be adequate at best.   The prosecco fondue and the mussels were really the winners of the night as our entrees didn't fare so well.  My burger was no where near the temperature I had asked it to be ( know before you go that medium here comes  up rare) and my burger toppings, like lettuce and tomato, had to be asked for repeatedly and my kale salad came without dressing.  My friends had the fish special of the day which was a mahi mahi, and was somewhat uninspired and lacked flavor. We also had beef short rib which looked the best at the table but desperately needed some seasonings and for some reasonh  it came up later than the rest of the food.    Were all these missteps a server issue? I don't know but we all walked away thinking it was just okay. But then our night got exponentially better as we went into the bar area and were served by John, bartender extraordinaire!  Now this is a guy who knows how to make his bar the place to be!  No wonder it was packed ( and on a weeknight, no less) and we needed to wait for a seat.  Our drinks were excellently poured, questions on wine answered and as busy as he was he even took the time to snap a picture of us.  And as we were leaving, John said how nice it was to see me again.  I thought about it and then had to ask as this was my first visit to this bar.  Turns out John had waited on me in his last place and remembered me!  How do bartenders do that?  I was blown away especially since I haven't been to that place in at least 2 years. But it took just that moment of humanity to have me leaving this place with a smile on my face and a promise to return to give the food ( and hopefully a different server) another chance.",0.9867,0.863,0.109,0.028,0.4489417989417989

Once we were finally seated, a waitress brought over small complimentary cocktails for each of us as an apology. Super nice & totally unnecessary...20 minutes isn't even very long!

My sister found Trellis by searching places with vegetarian options nearby a spa we had planned on going to in Lincoln Park. What a pleasant surprise it was! It was easy to find although it blends in to the neighborhood in which it's located. We didn't have any trouble finding a parking spot, but I can imagine it would be slightly more of a challenge during the week and especially during dinnertime on a Friday or Saturday.  We had a reservation, but that wouldn't have mattered as there was plenty of seating. The place is a bit on the small side, so the reservation was a good safety net. The hostess was nice as was our waiter (Julian, maybe?). Julian (?) made excellent recommendations so we ended up with a little bit of everything, including the Prosecco Cheese Fondue, Frites, Oysters on the half shell, a Wild Mushroom flatbread, and a Kale & Radicchio Salad. I'm not ashamed to say that very little of that meal was left on the plates. We also had dessert, but I can't recall what kind and I couldn't find it on the online menu. Everything was delicious! My favorite was the fondue. That's the kind of stuff you wanna dip your entree into.  ...I'm not saying I did, but I am saying that I wanted to. The place stayed pretty quiet to low volume while we were there and that includes the lively discussion the bartender and some other patrons were having about Despicable Me 2.

The stools and booths in the front half of the place make it look awesome and trendy, but they're tall and treacherous. Children + those seats = a recipe for disaster.

I am normally a red wine drinker but the server recommended a white that he thought my date would like, and to my surprise I was drinking white wine, and loving it. The manager, Susan, was great too. She checked in on our table, and even allowed us to taste a few other wines while explaining the complexities of the wine. She definitely made the wine drinking experience fun.

I was impressed that Iberico ham was a selection on the charcuterie (for an extra $4).  We tried a trio of the Montamore cheese, the Creminelli Calabrese, and the special beef jerky (at the recommendation of the server) in lieu of the ham.  The selection was a great way to segue into the entrees. Hubby had the Jalepeno and Fontagio Bisquits with the pork sausage gravy.  The bisquits were on the dense side and the gravy was rich, heavy, and creamy, just the way this Southern gal likes it.  The White Chocolate Pancake was calling me, but in my attempt to eat healthier, I chose the House Cured Salmon instead.  Standard fare - it was a good ratio of salmon to toast and spread.  We also shared a side of Fruit & Berries that came in a cute glass jar.  Perhaps next time I'll go for the pancake or be guilted into the Granola & Yogurt.",0.9659,0.895,0.105,0.0,0.3866917293233083

The scallops were decent, but they were baby scallops, which isn't mentioned on the menu.  2. The meatballs were poor - with a sauce that was just lacking in flavor, and oddly spicy. Not a good kind of tasty spicy, but a ""why does this taste oddly spicy"" kind of spicy. (Also - who serves meatballs and sauce without bread? Spoiler Alert: Trellis does) 3. We had a chicken salad which was just bad - looks like they just threw a bunch of stuff together in a bowl.  4. And the iberico ham pizza, also just bland - and ridiculously overpriced at $18.  I was going to try the coffee gelato, but after 4 misses on dishes we decided we'd had enough.  I guess if I lived within 2 walking blocks of Trellis I'd be forced to come here more often - purely out of convenience. But I certainly wouldn't come here for the service or the food.

2014-06-06,5.0,"I had one of the coolest experiences of my life at Trellis the other night. It wasn't all because of the restaurant, but the excellent service and food certainly contributed! I saw my two cousins and aunt for the first time in twelve years and it was like not a day had gone by between us. Because of this amazing experience, Trellis will always hold a special place in my heart.  Fantastic company aside, the food is fabulous at Trellis. We started with the fondue and then three of the four of us got the pulled pork sandwich while the vegetarian of the group enjoyed the goat cheese and fig pizza. I haven't had fondue in forever and usually picture it as a heavy après-ski meal reserved for cold winters. Trellis puts a summery spin on it with really light cheese spiked with Prosecco complete with apples and grapes for dipping-delicious! I should mention the extensive beer menu they have going on here. I am no beer expert so I was appreciative of our knowledgeable server. My cousin got the Game of Thrones beer, it was amazing (obviously). The pulled pork sandwich is not to be missed. Love the house made Dijon mustard, perfectly crusty bread, and of course the pork. It's superbly balanced with both sweet and smoky notes and piled on the bread in just the right amount. Don't overlook the truffle aioli that's served with the sandwich and fries, it's good to dip anything in. We also kept the leftover fondue for our fries, which turned out to be an excellent idea. We wanted to try the gelato but decided to have another beer for dessert instead, as usual!  I would love to go back to Trellis and explore more of the Lincoln Park area, with my newfound cousins as my local guides, of course! One last tip, you push the bathroom doors. It took four women, two with masters degrees, to figure this out. You're welcome for saving you from any undue embarrassment.",0.998,0.77,0.213,0.017,0.6041486291486292

They have a great special on Wednesdays, $4 for all draft beers, and they have a huge selection which is worth stopping by for alone.  We started out with the Prosecco Cheese Fondue and Scallops. The Scallops are to die for and a must have if you stop by Trellis. The creamy grits they sit upon were perfectly complemented by the brown butter sauce and the scallops were also perfectly cooked. My sister joked she wished she could eat them all herself and I didn't blame her!  The Prosecco Cheese Fondue on the other hand was not my favorite. The fondue itself was good but the assortment of snacks that accompanied it were lacking in my opinion. The pretzel bites which were the main item seemed to be frozen to me and were not well cooked at all. I've been to all of the Four Corners bars and the pretzel bites were definitely not up to the standard I've come to expect from their places. I was also really confused about the salami that came with it and what it had to do with the fondue.  We ended our meal by splitting the Fig Jam & Bacon pizza. The crust was excellent but I did not love the pizza, I blame that more on my personal preference than on the restaurant though. The fig jam was a little too sweet for my taste; however, I'd definitely recommend one of their pizzas. I also have to mention the ambiance of Trellis. They did a great job of renovating this place and it is now upscale without being too trendy and is just the kind of place you want to unwind with an adult beverage after a long day at the office.

I was condo hunting the in the area and was excited to see a neighborhood wine bar.  I made a reservation through Opentable and arrived at my designated time.  This is where things took a turn.... The hostess led us to the back room, to the next to last table by the kitchen.  The last table by the kitchen was occupied by a family with two screaming kids (and let me preface this by saying that I have kids, so I'm as sympathetic as any, however I don't think I'd ever take my kids to a wine bar).  I saw two open tables on the way in, a two top and a four top, and asked if we could take one of these instead.  The hostess said those tables were reserved for others. So we tried to make the best of being stuck on top of a table of screaming kids.  The wine list was above average, and they have an interesting food selection.  None of that saved the experience, though, and to make matters worse, in the hour and a half that we were there neither of the ""reserved"" tables wound up getting taken by others.  No one seemed particularly concerned, nor did the restaurant's ownership group, who I notified of my experience as well.  I guess maybe if you're a regular you get a better experience, or maybe I just drew the short straw, but I've never in my life experienced service this bad.  And I can buy any of their wines at Binny's for half the price and enjoy them in the privacy of my own home, yes there probably will be screaming kids but at least they're mine.",0.6242,0.848,0.092,0.061,0.41421911421911417

I also tried the chorizo and grits! Yummy!! Probably the best of the dishes, mixed with a delicious tomato sauce.  The sauce is great to dip some extra bread in. The duck grilled cheese was very good, but could definitely use some more cheese to throw it in that grilled cheese category.  It's more a duck sandwich right now, but still tasty.

The Vegetable Eggs Benedict ($9) with braised kale and roasted red peppers was light and delicious.  The Crab and Lobster Omelet ($10) was somehow rich and light with big chucks of seafood. The bright red tobiko sprinkled on top added great texture! I asked for the sauce on the side which I would recommend. Coffee is served in cute little french presses. Tables are a little close to each other, and with no place to put all your winter gear or purses it was kind of awkard.

2014-01-03,4.0,"We live down the street and really enjoyed coming when it was Gaslight so were surprised to see the change (although understand 4 Corners' desire to diversify with the Crossing so close). We came for brunch and had 2 of the morning cocktails - bloody with extra spicy, smoky mix and a ""root beer"" bourbon drink - both were fantastic. The brunch food would definitely be classified as comfort food - we had the chorizo and grits and the jalapeno + cheese biscuits and gravy. Both dishes were really tasty. Prices are comparable to brunch spots in the area. The unique thing that we will have to go back for is the wine list - it looked like a great selection but at a far lower markup than most restaurants (based on a few of the bottles I knew it looked to be a 2x markup which is far less than the typical 4x+). Our server confirmed it by telling us they average a 100% margin on all wines - so there are a lot of affordable bottles and most glasses were probably $8 or so. We'll definitely be back!",0.9007,0.869,0.105,0.025,0.5366161616161617
2013-12-26,4.0,"This bar changed over recently from a college/post college bar food establishment to a more sophisticated version of that catering to a crowd 10-15 years older that wants farm to plate experience.  They didn't do a bad job at all.  The food is good/wonderful, service is good and I didn't feel as if the food was obnoxious and too snooty like the Monkey's Paw (no disrespect, but i prefer this menu).  We've already taken out of town foodie guests, one of which, is a professional chef, and they both approved.   It's good/fantastic and within walking distance, so we'll be back for brunch and dinner. We went here for brunch with some guests from out of town with our 20 month old and then went to date night here as well (without the 20 month old).  Both were great experiences.",0.9448,0.837,0.137,0.027,0.36153846153846164
2013-12-23,4.0,"This review is for TRELLIS BRUNCH. I went to Trellis for Sunday brunch yesterday with my husband and another couple. We started with coffee, which was French press and excellent. The brunch menu has high quality items at a great price point. Most brunch entrees are $10 or under. Like other trendy brunch spots, Trellis also offers some good sides too, like sweet potato latkes with apple butter (yum). Our group tried the apple pancakes (great), mushroom omelet and vegetarian eggs Benedict (unique option). The food was 4/5 stars. Mostly good, but the eggs on the Benedict were over-poached and not runny, which ruins the point. Trellis has fresh squeezed orange juice and a good brunch cocktail list.  I would definitely recommend Trellis brunch. Fancy brunch food for a good price point, with simple items for the boring eaters and fun items for the adventurous. Plus, they take brunch reservations on Open Table which is pretty rare and awesome!",0.9935,0.71,0.275,0.015,0.61239010989011
2013-12-16,4.0,"My husband and I visited Trellis for the first time Saturday evening.  I had been a little leery after checking the menu online and finding it a bit limited, but the food turned out to be quite nice.  We shared the arancini appetizer.  The three arancini (deep-fried rice balls stuffed with cheese) were crisp and tasty.  They came on a bed of squash puree that was an unusual but surprsingly appropriate complement.  I then had the endive salad, which was prepared with blue cheese and pancetta.  This was really lovely and satisfying.  My husband ordered the shaved lamb sandwich, which came with a small bowl of au jus for dipping and frites with aioli sauce.  He enjoyed this dish very much.  We each ordered a glass of red wine from the extensive selection.  The Barbera I had was terrific.  We'll definitely return.  While we had enjoyed Gaslight in this location, Trellis is another step up from typical ""bar food,"" and I look forward to trying other menu items.  (Note:  It can get a little loud, so perhaps not the best place for an intimate conversation.)   (Note 2:  I used my Four Corners Tavern Group card and received triple points, good for $5 off on my next visit.  The same evening, I received an email request to complete a short survey, and upon doing so, received a certificate for a free appetizer on my next visit.  I appreciate the management's attentiveness to generating return business!)",0.9931,0.795,0.182,0.022,0.4818125960061444
2013-12-11,5.0,"Popped into Trellis about a week after it opened and I LOVE it!  For starters, the Venison Meatballs and Wild Mushrooms over pasta...FANTASTIC.  Our server recommended the Pork Osso Bucco and he wasn't wrong. The meat just falls off the bone and is succulent.  As a side we had the Shaved Brussel Sprouts with Pork Belly. I could eat this side dish for days. It's got some citrus in it and it's perfect.  They carry my new favorite beer (Off Color, Scurry) which is a bonus.  Our server was AMAZING and I wish I remembered his name.  The decor is beautiful.  Trellis is going to do really well. I can't wait to come back.",0.9865,0.742,0.258,0.0,0.6454545454545455
2013-12-10,1.0,"Very limited disappointing menu, limited beer and spirit selection, food was below average and over bearing bartendress trying to oversell the food. Very disappointing from a fairly accomplished bar group. Stick to with what got you there.",-0.8245,0.619,0.098,0.283,0.473095238095238
2013-12-09,4.0,"Food was pretty good... Wine bong was the best thing EVER! ! I'd go back just for the fun in that!  My only complaint would be that it was so hot inside! I'm typically freezing and I was sweating. Granted it was the coldest night of the year, so perhaps they were over compensating but if that is the only complaint i'd say that is good news! :)",0.9147,0.713,0.217,0.07,0.5730769230769232
2013-12-05,2.0,I've been to Trellis twice now and everything I ordered was overly salty. Please ask Chef Sara to hold the salt! We like the new addition to the hood but won't be going back if the food continues to be overly salty. I'll give it one more chance.,0.684,0.869,0.131,0.0,0.3181818181818182
2013-11-26,4.0,"I have been known to frequent the many bars of Four Corners and for most part- know what they are doing. From good food, nice selection of beer and pretty much a decent crowd- their bars can be a good time. So when going to Trellis I thought it was pretty much going to be the same type of thing with just a bigger wine selection but I was really wrong.  Four Corners stepped out of their comfort zone and took a risk with this swankier, more mature bar; and the was that risk worth it. From their very unique beer list that even someone like me, who usually goes for a Coors or 312, can find something they enjoy. Thanks to the bar staff, that isn't their first bar job but a well-trained, knowledgeable staff that knows their stuff. The wine list can be a little scary for someone like me, who knows nothing about wine but, between your friends and the staff - you'll find the perfect bottle.  But what really sets Trellis apart from every other bar in the city is the food. When first looking at the menu you may be taken back, as there is no regular chicken sandwich, quesadillas or any other typical bar food but, don't be scared because it's all amazing. I am not a fan of bacon and really can't tell you what a Fig is but,  their Fig Jam & Bacon Pizza is one of the most incredible things I have ever put in my mouth.  Literally, you can pick anything from the menu and not be disappointed.  So, next time you are going out make sure you stop into Trellis. I promise you that you will not be disappointed and might even go out of your way to write a review- just like I did.",0.9923,0.745,0.192,0.063,0.5268536324786324
2013-11-23,4.0,"We went to this restaurant shortly after its opening.  We loved the food, and everything came out perfectly prepared.  Considering that the restaurant was packed, and it had been open only a short time, we expected some glitches, but were pleasantly surprised with the perfection of service and preparation of food.  My only complaint is that it is very noisy.  Given the menu, price and design of the interior, I would have expected a little quieter atmosphere.  We will definitely give it another try.",0.9461,0.728,0.218,0.053,0.5785714285714286
2013-11-21,3.0,"The old gaslight space got a revamp and now it is no longer a sports bar, but a sleek wine bar with dark interior and comfy seating. Wine is their ""thing"" and they have a solid list with some quirky blends for my first round it was the pinot noir from the russian river valley (who knew). I will say though for a wine bar they should take some more time to train their servers. Don't get me wrong I am not a wine snub, but I do know a few and they would be appalled at the presentation and opening. I legit thought the cork might break off and the waiter didn't offer me a taste, he just went ahead for two full pours! Plus he did know the wine list. In terms of food we had a charcuterie plate of three cheeses and one salami. It was great, a nice selection of mild and bold cheeses to suit most palates and our waiter was able to make a few recommendations.  I ordered the shaved leg of lamb sandwich and it totally hit the spot, but the fries were overly salty.  My friend had the burger and thought the same, but it all got devoured so there wasn't too much of a problem. Bottom line solid three star place at the moment would come back once the kinks are worked out. The food was good but not great and the wine was the high point, but needs a little bit better presentation, the true winner though is the ambiance. .",0.9919,0.795,0.173,0.032,0.4779999999999999
