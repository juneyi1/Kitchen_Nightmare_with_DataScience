2017-08-04,1.0,"I hate to give inspiration corporation's kitchen a single star.  I really do.  I've eaten at their restaurants several times before and it's always been great fare and great service.  Plus they are a non-profit training people for careers in food service. Today i ordered carry out for several of us.  Staff was friendly and my order was ready when promised.   However, i ordered from the online menu. I asked for the peach and beet salad.  When i opened my carry-out back at work, what i had been given was a big lump of faro with 5 or 6 less than bite size slivers of beets and 3 or 4 partial orange segments.  The faro was tasteless and i frantically searched our little break room kitchen for something to dump on it to give it some semblance of flavor.  I eventually found some hot sauce that did not go well with the faro.  But without it, eating the faro was similar to eating unadorned boiled pasta.  It was just absolutely unsatisfying. I had picked up a printed menu while i was paying, and it was different from the online menu.  If i had been told when i was ordering by phone that what i was ordering was not available but that i would be given something similar, i would have been willing to go with their suggestion or just order something else. But to let me order a dish that was unavailable and just give me whatever they decided was close enough is not my idea of good customer service.  if i had wanted the restaurant to choose my meal, i would  have requested that. Do try the Inspiration Corporation's diners;  you'll probably enjoy it, and it's great to support the training they are providing.  Just be sure to verify that what you order is what you are going to be served.",0.9856,0.857,0.12,0.023,0.4896237507348619

Inspiration Kitchens isn't located in the greatest area, but is a stone's throw away from the Green Line stop and street parking seemed to be plentiful.  On a Sunday for brunch, they weren't too busy at 11am, and we enjoyed our blackened catfish and grits as well as the chicken and waffles.  Service was excellent, and apparently it's even BYOB!

I took my mom for Sunday brunch and it was the worst service I have received in a restaurant. The waiter took our order and we waited 45 minutes for our food. I wanted to get up and leave after 30 minutes but my mom really wanted to try the food. I ordered the chicken and waffle and didn't realize it came with an over easy egg on top. I let the waitress know and she said no problem I will bring you a fried egg. My waffle did not have syrup on it so I asked for syrup also. Well I finished the meal before she came back because the chicken was actually very good with my dry waffle. The waitress comes back 30 minutes later and let's me know they have a large party to cook for so my egg will take a little longer. I proceeded to grab my jacket and I asked for the check. She comes back and apologizes saying she discounted my meal. I was so put off by this experience and I won't return.

Before coming, I had browsed the menu , so I was slightly put off by the prixe fixe menu. However, they had thoughtful and delicious vegetarian options. For the first course, I had a spiced arugula salad. The cherries were a bit tart but not sweet, so it was well balanced. For the second course, I had the mushroom and farro risotto, which is actually made out of oats, I believe. The tofu was a tad sweet, but the flavors were excellent. The pecans and mushroom really added a hearty element. For my last course, I had the peach cobbler pound cake--also no complaints here.

For example, the brisket was great the first time my husband got it, but rubbery the second. Also they serve their jar spreads with stale crackers that look like they came out the back of someone's cupboard. The pear salad was overwhelmingly sweet and the shrimp and grits were just OK. The catfish po boy, gumbo and banana bread pudding are superb. But I'm a little more reserved about Inspiration Kitchens than I was before.

When stormed out of this place the only regret I had in mind was the incessant question: ""Boy oh boy how did I forget to snap a picture..."" A picture of the absolutely RAW/ PINK RED disgusting chicken breast that came in the chicken sandwich. After about a 30 minute wait in this 4.5 stars awarded joint we received a plate of shrimp and grits so grossly salty it made us cringe followed by a plate of nicely crisped out this outside completely raw on the inside chicken breast. When we called the waitress to show her their product the first word that came out of her mouth wasn't "" I'm so sorry"" or ""I apologize"", nope it was ""AWE HeALL"". We had to just run for the hills before catching any septic doses of salmonella.  All in all this was a horrid experience and we were still in shock when we got back home a few hours later. If a restaurant can successfully screw up frying a chicken breast then it is time to consider a different line of work. May i suggest musical instruments sales.  On a separate but related note, it is a complete mystery as to how this place earned 4.5 stars.

The asparagus salad was supposed to come with shaved fennel and the woman next to me had a nice serving, I had two tiny slivers of fennel. My fish was so over done it was inedible and since they were out of the risotto it was supposed to be served with it was just a very very very dry piece of fish on a plate next to salad. The beef short rib my husband got was delicious. The chowder was not tasty, and the dessert cake was very dry. My husband never complains and even he was disappointed... It was very obvious they were not prepared to serve us at 8:45..... So then don't offer the reservation slot, and you knew we were coming so don't run out of everything!

2014-10-20,2.0,"Review number two for me at this place. I'm teetering between a 2 and 3 star rating now.  After walking in we were absentmindedly asked to wait while they cleared some tables. They were not rude but they definitely did not have the demeanor I would expect from a full service restaurant. After being seated we were warned that they were fairly busy so the food may take a while. Which we were ok with.  The problem with that is we waited at least 15+ minutes just for a drink order (we were ready to order food too but the waitress scurried away before we could). Another 10 minutes and we had our food order in. About this time a host asked us if we would move tables so they could fit a bigger group in at our table and the one next to it. Again not a big deal and we did so without problem. Then we waited about 20 more minutes for our food. And as usual the food was GREAT. Some of the best food I've tasted in Chicago. Except the tea my boyfriend ordered never showed up, nor did his toast. And we had to walk up to a host to get more water. After bringing us our food we were never checked on by the waitress... we had to walk up to the host stand where she was with everyone else working to ask for the toast. She talked to the kitchen and apologized, but the toast never actually came.  Then we had to flag her down for the bill and wait another 5-10 minutes for that. And then we had to walk back up to the host stand to pay as she never came back for my card.  So in short - The food was amazing. The service was beyond unacceptable. They were busy, but had empty tables and more than a few servers... who all appeared to be standing around at the register instead of checking on tables. We never got some of our food/drink, even after asking about it missing. And what should have been a 45 minute-ish dining experience at MOST turned into 70+ minutes.  I'll give this place another chance before writing them off completely, but only because of the food.

From the moment we pulled up the property has an outdoor garden that they pick fresh produce from to use in their dishes. The decor and ambience is super bright and welcoming. From the bright blue walls to the personalized wood. White linen napkins and a bottle of fresh cold water in glass bottles.  We were welcomed by the  Sweetest woman ever. Se was so natural and so happy that I wanted to her to sit and join us! She was super motherly  and She said I had to get the basil lemonade and the crab cake Benedict.

(Why hadn't I thought of this before. )I couldn't believe it was only $2 it went perfect with my champagne!! Oh did I say byob yet?? When my monster sized crab cake Benedict arrived I was speechless... How is this only $10 . My mom ordered the 2 egg special ( she's pretty simple.) For dessert we shared the French toast with blueberries and marscapone!! Wow, the batter was even better. When our bill came. It was less than $30 how is that possible I have no idea. So I saved the best for last. This restaurant is not just a place to eat it's an organization that trains people that are or near homelessness .

In terms of the type and quality of food, Inspiration Kitchens offers a unique good: a generous portion of fantastic food at a great price (~$10-12 a plate) served by people who genuinely seem to love their jobs: our server was genuinely friendly and unpretentious, admitting to his secret love for World of Warcraft while taking the orders. The dining area is uncrowded, with lots of natural light and a high ceiling. The food was... well, we drank sauce from its dipping vessel after the dippees were vanquished. Shortly afterwards, the shrimp came out sitting on a delicious, buttery duvet of grits as did the braised beef so tender you could cut it with a fork. I wish I could say that we demolished them, but as I savored each cushion-y bite, doused liberally with sauce americain, the duvet appeared to regenerate itself - miraculous indeed.

2014-04-21,4.0,"For those that understand the concept of this place - it really is a remarkable operation with a terrific mission.  A beautiful space across the street from a beautiful Chicago landmark park, mixed into a completely unjustified, under served community which is viewed by the general public as rough or whatever...  No matter what your take on the Garfiled Park neighborhood - this place is absolutely worthy of being a destination dining spot, and for all the right reasons. First, the ambiance was wonderful for a recent weekend brunch had by me and three others.  Great mixture of music, sun pouring in through the windows.  Clean, vibrant space that was both open, and yet offered our table enough space to not feel crammed in with the other patrons. Food was absolutely flawless.  Amazing, really.  The chefs/cooks in the kitchen make tremendous food.  Between the four of us (remember - brunch), we had three different dishes (two went for the same thing).  All three dishes were adored by everyone there.  Peach Pancakes were told to be nothing less than ""really good"" by everyone that tried (sadly, I missed out).   The Shrimp and Grits (one that I did get to try) were tremendous.  While the portion size may look to be a bit small, this dish is rich and fills you up quickly.  The grits portion comes as a lovely, delicate cake which is topped by luscious and perfectly cooked shrimp and a thick, buttery sauce - it's super satisfying.  Best shrimp and grits?  I'm no expert, but perhaps, and definitely something I've thought about going back for real soon over the last couple of days. But honestly, I can say with hardly any reservations that the Fried Chicken Sandwich was the single greatest fried chicken sandwich I've ever had.  Something I'm embarrassingly known for is my ridiculous love for fried chicken - in all forms.  Sandwich form is a good one, and while I've made great strides over the last year or so to cut more and more meat out of my diet, I still gravitate towards fried chicken when I'm out.  One of the reasons I've been able to cut more and more meat out of my eating habits is because I don't find meat eating while dining out as satisfying or necessary for a good experience as I used to. This sandwich though has flawed me and my plans to go full-on vegetarian.  It's perfectly balanced.  The chicken itself has a light, nicely seasoned breading and comes out piping hot and juicy.  A seasoned buttermilk dressing lightly slathered on a grilled bun.  A tart, slightly spicy red cabbage slaw and a side of pickled peppers add a good amount of tartness and spice.  The roll is buttery and light, yet fully holds up and contributes to the combinations of tart slaw and pickles, the smooth sauce and the chicken. I'm obsessed, and grateful that this is a lunch menu item, along with brunch on the weekends.  Comes with chips or a side salad.  $8.00.  Not that I want them to raise the price, but I'd easily pay double that for such a perfect meal. This sandwich, along with this place, and only being 1/2 block away from one of Chicago's most beautiful institutions in the conservatory is what sick days off of work are made for.  My wife and I frequently ride our bikes down Lake Street well beyond here, and we can state with certainty this specific area is nothing to be afraid of.   While I've gushed so far about the ambiance, the mission and of course the food - our service was a bit slow and labored, which is the only reason I haven't given five full stars.  We were sat at a table that was meant for a reservation, moved after being given water and so forth, and food took a long time to come out.  We didn't care in the least because our group was catching up and having a good time - but it was still something to note.

2013-09-30,4.0,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. IT WAS SO GREAT. And let me tell you why. I had been wanting to come to one of Inspiration Corporation's restaurants since I found out about them sometime two years ago. I was finally able to come to the one in Garfield Park this Saturday for lunch through a school program. Not only should the mission and vision of Inspiration Kitchens be commended, the food was delectable as well. I had some of the watermelon salad. I haven't had salad yet with watermelon in it as I had always been a little weary of the sweet fruit in my salad even though I knew it was becoming a popular salad ingredient more recently. But I was blown away at how all of the flavors in the salad came together. The watermelon went so well with the cucumbers, lime dressing, feta cheese, and the greens! I was so happy I got a heaping portion. I then had the fried green tomatoes with buttermilk sauce and it was okay but the thing that really got me was the fried chicken slider with a spicy slaw and a little bit of buttermilk dressing. This sandwich was SO good I was wishing I could rewind time and eat it again. And again. And again. I also brought home all of the left over sliders (5) so I could eat it. Again. And again. And again. And again. AND AGAIN. The space was also so cool. We ate in a separate room away from the main dining area so we could meet and talk but the room had a dry erase wall which we didn't use but would have been useful for a lunch meeting. The gardens outside allow them to grow a lot of their own produce which they also sell to the public which is AWESOME because the area is classified as a food desert. Moreover, the service was so great and everyone was so friendly and took care of all of our needs including extra water and to-go boxes before we could even think to ask. I had such a fantastic experience and would recommend this place to all my friends. It IS a little far to come for lunch from the loop but if your work is having a lunch event, they do have catering!

Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The menu's got something for everyone and it was hard to choose what to eat. i had the Biscuits and Gravy (cheddar biscuits, scrambled eggs, chorizo gravy) and my boyfriend ordered the Texas Toast scramble (scrambled eggs, sausage, sweet potatoes and cheese on top of Texas Toast) and a side of bacon. Food came quickly. And was delicious. I've knocked off one star due to the plating of the biscuits and gravy. The gravy and eggs were layered through the biscuit, resulting in a soggy, albeit yummy, biscuit. Love the bright space. Plenty of seating. And parking in a small lot out front was convenient. The place was filling up as we were leaving. And the clientele was diverse and surprising considering the neighborhood. Lots of young families, neighborhood folk and hipster couples.

The collards were delicious with an acidic bite, a flavor I've never quite tasted before in collard greens. And the sweet potato was baked, seasoned, and sectioned perfectly.

Our server, Fannie, was one of the best, most enthusiastic servers I've ever encountered at any restaurant - friendly, attentive, intelligent, full of suggestions, and she even made us her own signature drink concoction (a mix of basil lemonade and watermelon soda)  :)  Basically, what I'm saying is, I want Fannie to be my bff.   The restaurant is located just off the Conservatory stop and 2 blocks from the Garfield Park Conservatory - easy peasy to get to!  We came here on Sunday afternoon after a trip to the Conservatory.... We arrived about 1:30 and even though the restaurant closes at 2, they were happy to seat us and did not rush us at all.  The interior is industrial chic. I ordered the french toast with orange syrup, which was pretty standard, but tasty.  My friend had the catfish po' boy and thought it was a delicious interpretation of a po' boy.  Prices are very reasonable. A+ business!",0.9634,0.758,0.177,0.065,0.6703095238095239
2011-10-01,4.0,"The Quinoa burger was probably the best veggie burger I have ever had. It was definitely made with quality ingredients, a thick patty on a bun with delicious grilled tomatoes and greens.  The price was good at $8.  The decor was surprisingly good, beautifully designed, modern finishes, cloth napkins, quality silverware, and spotlessly clean.  It is a quite and peaceful setting, and has a healthy and appealing menu.   The service was ok, a bit slow and dispassionate until I complemented the food, then the interaction was very engaging.  At 12:30 on a Saturday the restaurant was about 1/3 full but there were no spots left in the small parking lot.  I parked nearby on the street, which is under the EL tracks.   I would definitely go again and bring others, especially if I was going to the Garfield Conservatory or Garfield Park, which is immediately across the street.  I would not wander into the residential neighborhood which is behind the restaurant.",0.9571,0.816,0.167,0.017,0.5683333333333334

2011-09-13,4.0,Only 4 stars because it was my first visit and I've only had breakfast. I can't wait to have lunch or dinner because breakfast was FAB-U-LOUS!!! I had turkey sausage (they make their own) and buttermilk pancakes with sliced pears and ginger/pear syrup! Woohoo! I'm all about GINGER with ANYTHING!  Others had the same or shrimp po'boy sandwiches.  We were celebrating a birthday and enjoyed BYOB as well. :D,0.9559,0.773,0.227,0.0,0.7369047619047618
2011-08-23,2.0,"Well, I hate to be the first negative review, but it is what it is. The service was negligent and while I waited for anyone to offer me a drink (8 minutes) I watched door sitting in the window for five of those minutes. Is my food going to sit there for that long? When we ordered appetizers and soups, we mentioned we might be hungry for more and the waitress told us they want the whole order at once! What if I don't want to do that? Tough luck? There's one waitress for 20 people and someone just standing at the host stand while food is sitting in the window. All that being said, the waitress was very knowledgable about the food, I overheard a customer ask about every dish and she was very educated so all problems to this point are organizational.  The bread that they serve comes with a colored butter that just tastes like butter which was disappointing. The bread was old. The oxtail empenadas were very good, a slight spice to the meat redeemed the underdone pastry. The dish wasn't consistent however, some being cooked more than others. The crawfish beignets were also very good, but the size of each varied to the degree that one was perfect, and the biggest was doughy. I then had the sweet potato soup and let me say that this was a grand slam, and cannot compliment it enough. The polenta fries however, were way to big to be fries and the bed of spinach that it was served on, actually had dirt on it.  All in all, I would go back if I was in the neighborhood, but I won't be making a special trip out there again. It is a great cause, but the food was subpar. I think if I caught them on a better day, then this review would be entirely different.",0.98,0.777,0.146,0.078,0.5005467372134039
2011-08-02,5.0,I have to admit bias since i work for IC and...it truly was an amazing dining experience. I ordered both the candied bacon waffles AND the shrimp and cheese grits (only order if you want to dream about them for days after!) and was so completely satisfied! Besides the great food the heart apparent at IK-GP makes me proud that these are my co-workers! Dine Well Do Good Indeed!!,0.978,0.648,0.336,0.016,0.7999999999999999
2011-07-22,5.0,"The worst thing about this place is trying to narrow down your selection.  Luckily, I went with a group of 8 and I am not shy about trying things off of other peoples' plates.  We went for dinner, and everything was fantastic.  The portions were generous and the prices were reasonable.  They even have a little parking lot if you are worried about parking on the street.  Make sure to check their hours for the restaurant before you head over, as they are only open Wednesday lunch thru Sunday brunch due to training programs they host for the community and they warn that hours are subject to change.  This place is a gem for this neighborhood and will have a long wait time before you know it...",0.7608,0.836,0.106,0.057,0.592962962962963
2011-07-21,5.0,"Fantastic meal, fantastic cause. I one point I looked down at my entree(pork loin- which was superb), and thought- 'if this was a fancy schmancy place they would divide this single portion into two entrees and double the price on each'. Inspiration Kitchens is a great way to enjoy a fine meal at an extremely reasonable price in a great atmosphere while supporting an important cause. Win-win-win.

I've had lunch here twice with two different groups (a total of 32 people!) and each time it has pleased everyone. Go, enjoy, be able to say ""I knew it when..."".

2011-07-01,5.0,"I had an excellent time here!  I had the ancho-marinated steak, which was just delicious.  As another commenter already mentioned, the wilted green salad that comes with several dinners was excellent - wilted just the right amount and not mushy at all.  The waitstaff was very friendly (maybe a little too much so - go and you'll know what i mean) and very nice about cleaning up our beers since we brought our own.  Highly recommend to anyone!",0.9685,0.758,0.242,0.0,0.6471703296703297
