2015-10-08,1.0,"I will never do business here again! The owner scammed me for my bday celebrations about a year ago.  I called in advanced, worked out a price to purchase a table for roughly 200 bucks, and gave him a head count.  It was the same night a halloween party was allegedly supposed to take place. I brought my friends and family in early thinking we could eat and party in the same space since I was bringing a lot of people to the venue.  Dinner was fine but half way through, the shady s.o.b. told me that our table reservation price was changing to about 500 bucks. It was my bday and I had already told people to meet here, plus had already had a few cocktails per my bday celebrations so I begrudgingly agreed to continue with the table reservation.  It was still pretty early and not too many people had shown up yet, but they were all too eager to sit us at our table and bring out our bottle service, before the party had even started. I had a big party with me so said, sure why not.   BIG MISTAKE. We were given a table in a room that had NO PEOPLE. Turns out, the Halloween party was a complete bust and people were only really hanging out in the bar area where there was a second dj playing. What a joke. Still I had a bunch of folks come out to celebrate my bday so I decided to brush it off and have a good time. Come to find out, they just wanted to make sure they had served us our alcohol so that we were locked in and they could charge us.  To make matters worse, one friend got sick so my cousin offered to drive her home to the hotel and return. Mind you, we had all been at Quay now for about 2 hours at this point.  When he returned, the door check hostess would not let him back in without paying $20 bucks for the $#@! party they were charging new customers to enter. I walked over to her and told her that he was with my party, and she proceeded to give me and him attitude and stated, she didn't care and he would have to pay. Why in the hell would you be so rude to customers who were willing to spend 500+ dollars at your establishment.  My final bill ended up being just over $650 (not including dinner)...a good $400 more than the original price quote.  Clearly I was taxed since their party was $@%!. I requested the manager come over and that prick treated both of us just as poorly as the hostess and threatened to kick my cousin out if he didn't pay. I guess he saw that I'd already spent my money so there was no need to be a decent or honorable businessman anymore.  He is very, very, lucky I didn't tap into my south-side self and take the appropriate next steps for people who are so utterly disrespectful and shameful. The manager/owner is a shady snake and their management is crap.  If you want to do anything more than just stop in for drinks and food, think twice.  Super shady business practices with asshole employees and they will never get my business again.",0.9914,0.763,0.154,0.083,0.502173320506654

The menu is very sparse. I chose the Crab Cake Benedict and my husband chose the Salmon Hash.  We waited an inordinate amount of time for our food considering the food itself and the presentation.  My Benedict was a microwaved frozen patty on the plate, two very cheap ""English"" muffins topped with rectangular fried eggs, and a heap of greasy black onion and cubed potatoes.  My husband had a bowl of the same black onions and potatoes mixed with microwaved bits of salmon (not fresh) mixed in with the same rectangular fried egg on top.  The decor was a mishmash of styles with a floor of carpet tiles over the concrete.

2015-03-22,2.0,"My friend made the reservations here and I am honestly not sure where she read  good reviews for Quay - you'd think the place would reflect the definition in the menu and the ambiance.  The ONLY mention appears in a graphic above the ladies room mirror- surely there has to be a BETTER way to implement the theme in the food, drink and décor. Quay means: a structure built parallel to the bank of a waterway for use as a landing place.  I guess the landing place most people make it to is a bar stool. The front bar is prominently in view when you enter - TVs everywhere, loud music and noisy ambiance.  While there were banquettes and other tables, none were filled.   When offered a choice of that or something else we picked Door Number Two and were taken/seated in the very empty middle dining room behind the bar where not a soul was to be seen. Are we in the same restaurant??? Our waiter was attentive, but please remember:  just because there's two of us ladies dining together, does not a date or 'couple' make.  ACKWARD!  We joked about it but really....there was absolutely no need to dim the lights to a level only a bat could appreciate. Menu choices online do not align with the printed version handed at the table. The extensive drink menu is pared way down... disappointing.  Beer seems to be the thing here.  The custom cocktails offered weren't anything special. We ordered beverages and got them promptly   Meal options also don't seem to be very creative either.  A pre-visit reading the reviews on Yelp had me convinced that the Pork Chop was the way to go. She picked the Salmon.  For a starter (aka Appetizer) we steered clear of anything 'pizza' and instead agreed to attempt the Steak and Tots.    Reviews here didn't lie:  More Tot than Steak for sure. Two small skewers of meat, cubed into 5 dice-size pieces each skewer, and 20 tots drowning in some cheese sauce.  I would have taken a photo but the place was so dark, my camera had no chance of focusing!  Dinner was so-so with our attentive waiter, who must have been very bored, ready to help at a moment's notice. Midway through our meal, our conversation was interrupted by an unseen woman screaming in pain/fear/throes of passion (?) her voice carrying all the way to the dining room.  ""Was it the menu choices?"", we joked.  Looking to get the attention of our waiter we discovered at that moment he was no where to be found. Dirty plates were promptly removed and dessert and coffee ordered. Flourless chocolate cake still cold from some refrigerator someplace was humungous for two to share although tough to get a fork through because it was more like fudge than cake because of the temperature. On an early Saturday evening, for more than two hours, only one other threesome was seated.  An extremely large boisterous party joined about thirty minutes after that. Bill was $109 for two cocktails, one starter, two entrees, one round of coffee and one piece of cake.  I could spend a bit more and have a quality meal elsewhere.",0.971,0.826,0.107,0.067,0.6051234567901234

It is well maintained and stylish. This is the most consistent (and best) part of my review.  The food is very inconsistent. Some items are amazing (like the scallops), other items depend on who's making them (like soups-they range from good to OK to a salt lick), and other items are terrible (like the obviously frozen and reheated chicken tenders). There is really no way of knowing what you're going to get, and for the price it's not a fun gamble. I live in Streeterville and have no problem paying for quality - the prices here do not reflect the (lack of) quality. The service is also inconsistent as well. Today was a new low. The manager (?)/bartender served me while 3 other staff members sat AT THE BAR, in their uniforms, talking smack about everyone and everything (LOUDLY), while DRINKING ON SHIFT!!!! I have worked in the food service industry and under no circumstance should this be acceptable, especially not when a customer is also seated at the bar.

2014-08-29,1.0,"I rarely give poor reviews, but I'm afraid this place merits the One Star.  I've actually visited this establishment twice, because of its location (literally a stone's throw from my apartment building) in the hopes of that it could serve as a ""go to"" spot for comfort food and Sunday Night Football.  But here's why I will steer clear of this place going forward. The first time I went to Quay, my Diet Coke was flat, flat, flat.  When I asked for a replacement, though the server was nice, the soda was still flat.  The burger I ordered was sloppy and nothing spectacular.  Overall, the experience was a Solid 3-Star.  As a result, I was hesitant about giving it a second chance, but, like I said, its location persuaded me to try again.  What a waste. On my second visit, we walked in and were seated promptly.  That is about the only good thing that happened.  We ordered an appetizer--a flatbread.  It came out stone cold--the cheese hadn't even melted.  It took about 20 tries to flag our server to alert him to the problem (which, in itself, is annoying).  He finally came back with a properly heated flatbread.  It then took another 30 minutes for the rest of our food to come out, which meant that the kitchen basically ignored our ticket until after the SECOND flatbread had been served.   I ordered a short rib grilled cheese sandwich.  When our food finally arrived (we'd been there for at least an hour at that point), I took one bite into my sandwich and got just cheese.  I took a second bite into my sandwich and again just got cheese.  Before taking a third, I opened my sandwich up to find that my ""Short Rib Grilled Cheese"" had no short-rib, as advertised.  I tried flagging down my server again--in vain--and ultimately, ANOTHER TABLE had to flag him down FOR ME.  He offered to re-fire my meal, but at that point, having been there for over an hour with a FLAT diet coke (AGAIN!) and barely any food, I just wanted to get outta there and never ever come back.   What particularly irked me was the fact that despite so many errors, I was not visited by a manager even once to apologize.  This place is sub-par on so many levels and quite frankly, that is so disappointing.  Streeterville is in desperate need of quality entertainment venues that live up to the demographic of its residents and Quay misses the mark by several miles.",0.9498,0.838,0.102,0.06,0.39561728395061735

A ""man in a mid-life crisis suffering from the consequences of his arrogant former glory meets Hooters"" concept in Chicago's River North neighborhood. A once fabulous mid-end restaurant with stunning service and interesting dishes. A rustic dimly lit bar still greets you when you enter Quay. You'll have plenty of time to take in it's ambiance as servers and the bar stare at you while you wait for the host to kindly escort you to your table. Or perhaps a server will have to do this for you. And no, the wait isn't because there is a line out the door. Quite the opposite. The restaurant used to be filled with nice white shirt waiters in black slacks but has since been replaced with women wearing the brand across their chest and a logo at the bottom of the back of their t-shirt. Enter the Hooters component of the new rebranded Quay. The one thing Quay always had an issue with, even in the days of its excellently thought out concept, was in the preparation of the food.

I started with the kale and artichoke dip which was amazing. My friend had the gumbo and said it was delish. For the main: amish chicken, lamb, and blackened catfish. Everyone said it was delish. The only downside was that it took a RIDICULOUSLY long time to get our food and the entrees are a wee bit overpriced to be mostly a main and no sides. The Docks/Pation:  This a great space, especially if not overly crowded. It has great views and a wonderful view. The unfortunate part is that the drinks poured are pretty pitiful and I mean less than what you would get if you were on a ""measured"" system and I think the bartenders are not really ready for primetime. I kept saying..they don't want to make any money else they'd move a little faster. I guess I get spoiled by those bartenders that can work entire crowds and not break a sweat. These on the other hand had the nastiest attitudes and would be pissed if you told them they messed up your order which was PRICEY!

2013-10-28,1.0,"I recently hosted my baby shower at Quay and although the location of the event was beautiful, the service was sub par, and even worse, the communication and response from management after my concerns were raised was awful.  My event had 20 people and not once during the event did the ""server"" ask me, (who I was 7mo pregnant and the hostess), nor any of my guests if we needed anything; he stationed himself behind the bar and it was up to us to go up to the bar and order a drink, and as for the food, it was placed in the back on tables; We were charged a mandatory 21% service fee, which I have No problem paying for good service, but I do have a problem paying for something I did not receive.  Additionally Sarah the event coordinator of Quay did a poor job at confirming and following through with what I originally confirmed within the contract.  When I called to discuss my concerns with her after the event, she told she would look into this and get back to me; a week later there was still no communication/follow-up returned from her.  At this point I contacted  the GM, Raphelo, who ""listened"" to my complaints but by the end of the conversation, I realized he was not concerned with ""hearing"" me.  He accused me of having 30 people at my event (which I did not have near that number), and continued on with the fact that his ""server"" was great and proposed that the lack of communication between Sarah and I was due to me.  Further he did not find fault with the fact that Sarah had not followed up with me regarding my concerns.  He then told me it was my responsibility to have told someone during the event if something was wrong.  So basically he was telling me that I should have done everything they should have been doing as the venue, versus them following through and making sure their customer/s were happy. Overall, I am left feeling that Quay is satisfied with providing mediocre  service and the facts are that communication between staff and from management is poor and unprofessional.  You definitely do not get ""what you pay"" for in terms of a downtown Chicago restaurant....I believe Chicago is a ""word of mouth"" city and there are far too many places to spend your money where you will be valued as a customer and where you and your feedback will be appreciated and heard....Quay is not this place!",-0.1419,0.82,0.086,0.094,0.5321296296296296

2013-09-30,3.0,"Ohh Quay. You make this review difficult to write. I want this to be 2 stars, perhaps even 1 star for the food. But 5 stars for experience.  Quay is within stone-throwing distance to the entrance to tourist-ville, Navy Pier. Friends came into town. Friends I love and due to a few restrictions, we decided that this neighborhood was the best option for our visit. We thought about Harry Caray's. But remember, I said I loved them and the food and service reviews were terrrr-ible there.  So we chose Quay. It's not like it's reviews were Girl and The Goat quality at Quay. But the pictures showed off this lounge that seemed perfect for a toddler to roam around in (yeah, we were THOSE people. But I mean, there were like 3 people in the lounge and it's HUGE so we weren't really bothering anyone!)  So this restaurant is GORGEOUS. rich textures, dark woods against creme white furnishings. I mean you look at it and say - ""eek we are going to spend a fortune!"" And then you read the menu and before you notice the pricing you say ""eek we are going to spend a fortune!"" and then you read those prices and say ""Are we in Baker's Square?"" Yeah. Really cheap!  So here you are at this gorgeous restaurant choosing elegant fare, and drinking fantastic cocktails, and your food comes and it looks so pretty and then you excitedly dig in and BAM - your world crumbles. The food blows. How?! My theory: they hired a talented exec chef to create a menu and then POOF fired him and hired line cooks to execute. It was terrible. Shockingly so. My visiting friends own a gastropub and they were in disbelief.  Now, I should say in full disclosure, that this was brunch and maaaay-be their dinner menu is better. So let's take a look at the food. 1. I had a burger sans the duck egg (allergy). Greasy meat, verry soggy bread (i had to eat with a fork and knife) and wilty bacon. Fries were fried in an oil that perhaps had fried too many things and for too long, you know that flavor. My daughter's chicken finger were afflicted with the same problem. First time in my life I didn't finish fries!!! 2. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak. It looked beautiful. He said the chicken wasn't tenderized enough was was tough and flavorless. The green beans were not good. He only finished about 3/4 of his meal. We are a couple that can, between us, finish and entire full size chicken pot pie, so we like to eat a lot! 3. My good friend is a veggie and asked for the corned beef hash without corned beef and with extra veggies. no joke, they served him a bowl of sauteed veggies. No hash. no eggs. Then he asked for the hash, which they brought in a separate bowl. Then he asked for a larger bowl to mixed them up in. Really? When his order was finally complete, it was flavorless and bland. 4. My friends' mother ordered the spinach and strawberry salad. The spinach was very bitter.  5. My other friend ordered the fritatta. She didn't say anything bad about it. but she also didn't say anything good about it. That means it was bad.  So everything - EVERYTHING- the price, the service the ambiance, the entire experience - AWESOME. but the taste of the food....I mean, just shockingly bad.  The final recommendation on this place is GO FOR THE DRINKS! The bar in the front and the lounge in the back are exceptional places to enjoy cocktails.

We got an apology from the waiter and he took our food order.  We were concerned because the 2 tables on either side of us were loudly complaining about the long terrible service.  They were right, after another 30 minute wait we were informed that one of the entrees we ordered was not available so we had to reorder.  The food came in a timely manner after the second order but I had to get our own drinks at the bar because our waiter was rarely in the dining room, I figured that after all the complaints he was getting he was on the phone with his therapist or something.  It was the 4th of July and we thought we had arranged our reservation to give us plenty of time to watch the fireworks, we missed them.  We expressed our displeasure with the hostess and she was obviously not interested.  If you are going to pay about $100 per person for a meal the service needs to be top notch as well as the food.  I'll admit the food is decent but the way management runs this place is terrible.  I won't be back.  By the way, if a customer waits over 30 minutes to get a drink maybe a drink on the house would help smooth things over, this never happened here.",-0.9642,0.865,0.045,0.09,0.5278911564625851

If you have been trekking through here or live in adjecent hoods you know what I am talking about.

I was here recently with a group of my friends after Millenium park concert on a Saturday Night. The service is great and attentive. The various powers that be basically make sure that if you are ordering a mixed drink or a cocktail that there is a good amount of alchahol ( I e vodka etc ) in it. and not like other places where they are watering down your drinks. They definitely do not do that over here. On this particular night which was on July 4th weekend we stepped briefly into the outdoor area to watch the navy pier fireworks for a few minutes. They also have another area which is to the extreme right of the bar area where people can just chill out and have a cocktail outside.  On the whole this is a good experience.

In between Navy Pier and the Mag Mile, this place is a great destination for visitors and locals on the stroll.  I had the Cobb salad that was AMAZING for a Cobb. We shared truffle fries- it was a good call to order two servings for our hungry lady party of 5. Those fries were gobbled down in minutes. I do have to admit, although my food was awesome, the rest of the ladies had luke-warm feelings about their entrees. They included the omelet, chicken and waffles, the lobster bisque soup, and the oatmeal.

2013-04-29,2.0,"Went here this past weekend.  Loved the space, the service, and potential, but not so much in terms of the food.  Bottom line, would re-visit as a place to grab drinks. . Service: the service was excellent from the start to finish.  We had a table of 9 for a birthday.  Dishes were explained, drinks were refilled.  The waiter was nice enough to take the time to cut our birthday cake and bring out extra slices as well.  This was a definite plus, and could not complain at all about this.  . Appetizers: Another highlight: got the artisan cheese board, which came with 3 varieties of cheeses.  The Walnut & pear tart was quite tasty and not too heavy at all.  The crackers had a Truffle Honey Comb which was very, very tasty, but wish they had given a little more of it.  Bacon wrapped scallops were not stellar, but definitely good.  . Entree: Wild Striped Bass.  Portion was a little smaller than I had hoped for the price.  Was not terrible, but was not the most flavorful bass I've had in Chicago.  And the texture was a little firmer than I would have liked.  I would say average; I just feel, at this price point, and portion size, I'd like to be wow'd by the bass.  I did like the ceci bean puree/curried cauliflower it was accompanied by.  About 3 other people got the same dish and had the same review/response that I did. A few other people had the grass fed NY strip and felt it was average, I can't speak for it personally as I did not taste it.   . Ambiance: very large and beautiful space.  Would love to come back for a drink at some point.  . Will be back to try out the drink menu a bit more, and possibly give a few other dishes a whirl and will update my review.   .

Luckily my friends are awesome and know how to play the game of Restaurant Week. Main rule: Order what you want, but try not to order the same thing and share. Gripes: The food was arriving so slowly that we honestly forgot what was even in our dishes (and our overwhelmed waitress didn't explain what our dishes were).

I am very understanding of dinner rushes and the difficulty of accommodating all of your tables, but we were there BEFORE it started. Also, it was a Wednesday. Majority of the prix fixe was delicious. For those of you who care, here's the breakdown: App Roasted beet salad (fav) - They took something so simple and elevated it with the pickled cabbage, smoked bacon and yogurt. Seafood a la Plancha -  Biggest disappointed. Scallop was salty and just looking at the ""laughing bird shrimp"" I knew it was overcooked. (Btw, it doesn't look as amusing as you'd think.) Octopus was very tender and good though. Sausage - Cumin. Just... lots of cumin with some heat. Soup of the day - Waitress didn't tell us this was an option. So we didn't try it.... Entree Crispy pork belly - False advertisement, it wasn't crispy. Otherwise, soft and tasty. Bass - it's fish. Tender squid and octopus Veal cheeks - Lip-smacking good (literally). But the balsamic vinegar with the ""apple & sage hash"" was so over-powering Scallops - On the verge of being overcooked. Random veal cheek saved it. Dessert There was only one option and they couldn't even keep it consistent. It was like Goldilocks. One had no crunchy thing, another had two of them, the other had chocolate UNDER the plate (which made it a mess for my sister), and one was just right (I got lucky).",0.9914,0.817,0.139,0.044,0.5364955357142857

We went for dinner the other night.  While I was warmly greeted by no less than 3 hostesses, when I sat at the bar to have a drink before my friend arrived, I had to flag down the bartender just to get a drink.  And even odder was that my request for a ""Pellegrino"" stumped her.  ""What?"" she asked.  After I explained to her I wanted some type of sparkling bottled water, she was able to find one small bottle behind the bar but the effort seemed tremendous.

The highlight of our evening?  Our server, Kristy.  This woman was amazing!  Personable, friendly, willing to accommodate even the hardest request, this woman on her own would make this a 4 star review!  She even went back and checked with the chef to make sure my ""no oil"" request would not get me a dried out piece of tuna! Dinner for two without drinks or dessert was about $100.  My ahi tuna was $27 and my friend's steak was $34.  The rest was in veggies.  The kitchen staff did an great job in dealing with our special requests.  They were executed perfectly which is not always the case.  My tuna was lightly grilled and my friend's steak came out a perfect medium rare.

So let's start with the bad, which mainly revolved around the fact that the place was really loud. That  could be attributed to the fact that it was the holiday season and there were a handful of Christmas parties going on. We all know how out of control those can get. Now for the good and really good. Service was on par and we were well taking care of, which means a lot. The staff was helpful with their recommendations for dishes and desserts.

2012-12-14,2.0,"This was weird.  From the start.  We pulled up to the valet and waited for a long time.  We thought at first that he was out parking a car but he came out from the building like he was on a smoke break.  Then he stood at his booth for a long time not making eye contact or indicating that he was indeed the valet.  Then he came over to my door.  We were totally confused.  When we looked back as we were walking in I noticed that my car was still sitting there with the hazards on and he walked back to the booth. Inside the hostess took my name and asked if the dining room was ok.  Huh?  We walked to our table without being offered a coat check.  That was fine because the room was empty.  And it was 8 on a Thurs.   The room was weird.  There was a party on either side and it was incredibly loud.  The waiter even said sorry I'm shouting at you but its loud in here.  The way the table is set makes it look like white tablecloth but there were no table cloths.  The super shiny lacquered tables looks too rustic.  Then you had the hotel lobby-like light fixtures and christmas wreaths hung where you could see the cords coming out from the wall.  The silverware was like from grandma's house and we had bread plates but no sign of bread whatsoever.  The columns were another style and of course the front is like a sports bar.  They're having an identity crisis.  Its like what looks like a decent bar in the front and then the back half wants to try really hard to be a hip steak house but not too stuffy.  Maybe they should just be a sports bar.   The people that I did see eating seemed to be tourists. Our waiter was great.  Very friendly, attentive and helpful.  We really liked him and the guy that poured water for us.  We started with prosecco which was too sweet for me.  To be fair the waiter did warn us.  We also got some red wine and both glasses were very good. Then it was a bit of a wait for our crab cake.  Had we had bread for our bread plates it would have been forgivable.  The crabcake had a great flavor to it.  Spicy and ginger and crunchy...the only ding is that it was a little bit wet.  Maybe if they made it a little smaller and 2 instead of 1 big one.  I had the pear salad and it was lovely.  Well seasoned and not too much dressing.  My friend got the goat cheese salad which was a little boring but I liked the dressing.  It was just lettuce and cheese w/ some nuts. My friend got the walleye which was very good.  The lemon gnocchi that came with it was amazing.  I got the bass which was super salty and watery.  The sauce on it was good.  We also got the brussels sprouts.  They converted my friend who thought she didn't like them. We tried the chocolate bombe.  It was just ok.  I didn't understand the popcorn and the presentation was odd.  Let's just say that chocolate smears across a bowl should be 86'd.  Then we tried the cookie tray.  The waiter didn't know what was on it even after he served it.  Probably not his fault but again a strange thing.  I don't know why pastry chefs continue to make those sugar covered jelly things.  No one likes them.  The cookies were kind of hard but I liked them a lot.  I'm not a key lime fan so passed on it.  The chocolate fudge thing was fantastic. So it seems that we kind of  liked the food but I don't think I'd be back.  If this place was in the burbs I think it would be busier.  As it is there's no reason to pay for a valet to eat here.  If I wanted a drink after a movie maybe?  But I don't see movies at the AMC b/c of the parking.",0.9988,0.758,0.181,0.061,0.570225988700565

Spicy fish chowder- 5/5: it's my favorite item of the night. The chowder had the perfect thickness and spice. One of the best chowders I've had.  Original Caesar salad-  I refuse to review this item. The husband ordered it in honor of our dog, but a salad is a salad... Venison- 4/5: after I ordered it for dinner, I realized they didn't ask me how I'd like it to be cooked. Then the dish came, perfectly medium, some parts were medium rare. The whole dish was a little on the sweet side due to the sauce and plum. But the meat was perfectly cooked.  Rabbit- 1/5: Worst dish of the night. My husband ordered it, the rabbit was really really dry and tough. We were joking that our homemade chicken breast probably taste ten times better than this rabbit dish.  For dessert, we got the pistachio cheesecake and some butter scotch thing with bread. The cheesecake was A-OK, I couldn't taste any pistachio except that it was visually green. The butter scotch was average too.  All in all, it's a not bad dinner. I'd give it 3.5 if Yelp allowed half stars. But if I didn't have the coupon from Gilt City, I don't think I'd come here. On a second note, given the atmosphere at the bar/lounge, I don't think I'd be back either.",0.9935,0.798,0.155,0.047,0.5927306547619049

I must say though, they lost me on the service.  Our party of five arrived at 8:30 pm.  We waited a very long time for service.  We waited a long time for our order to be taken, for drinks to be served, and we waited an extremely long time for our entree.  So long in fact, the waiter sent the manager over to ""talk"" to us.  The manager gave the excuse that it was busy and a Saturday night - actually it was quite the opposite.  The dining room was pretty full, but there were no customers in the entire front half of the restaurant in the large bar area.  And as any restauranteur knows, you make the real money on Friday and Saturday nights - why weren't they prepared?  Anyway, the manager comped our drinks to make amends and ordered a second round for us.  We then proceeded to continue to wait for our entrees.  We waited so long that we looked for the waiter to cancel the rest of our food because we were late meeting other friends at a club.  Just as we were requesting to cancel our food, it magically appeared.  I think I read another review that referred to the service as ""disorganized and unpolished"" - truer words have never been spoken!   The staff seemed uncoordinated in their efforts.  Additionally, there was no dress code for the staff and some were dressed so casual,  I didn't know they were staff until they started clearing away plates.",0.9482,0.839,0.106,0.056,0.4896031746031747

Well Quay is the anomaly, because beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder here, you'll either love it or dislike it. (SN: My concluding sentence will address the ""only ugly people say that"" line) The location is unbelievable -- its ""a hop and a skip"" away from the lake and Navy Pier and within arms reach of the Magnificent Mile. Streeterville is a pretty swanky area but the nook and cranny that Quay is tucked in -- offers a bit of ""lake-oceanic euphoria in the heart of downtown Chicago.""  The flow of the restaurant is pretty cool. You first walk into a pretty neat bar area, then a pseudo-fancy yet sizable dining room and then an ultra-modern and plush lounge area that overlooks the lake and architectural boat tours. My dish was amazing! I had the SPICY SHRIMP and CRAB BISQUE soup. It contained pure miracles: rock shrimp, lump blue crab, andouille sausage, sweet corn and popcorn shoots and HANDS DOWN it was the best soup I have ever eaten -- IN MY LIFE! And I have tasted soups from all four corners of the globe! I finished it off with a glass of Maker's Mark on the rocks -- and I have to say that my experience here was indelibly amazing.

They offer you seating in the bar, dining room, and atrium, so my friend and i decided to eat in the atrium. We ordered cocktails which were pretty good and strong, and had the tartar duo appetizer which was good. We soon started to notice at least 20 small gnats flying around us an our food. Of course this started to get unbearably annoying, and we kept waiting for our waitress to show up to move tables. We called over a bus boy who's could barely understand what we were saying and barely spoke english. We had him get our waitress because we hadn't seen her for a bit. When we asked if we could move to the other room she gave us the nastiest look and said she was not sure and had to ask her manager. Now the whole restaurant was pretty much empty except for one other table in the atrium and maybe three in the dining room. Our waitress was just outright rude to us, and a manager came over to apologize and move us to the dining room. Our food came out, and I had the ahi tuna. It was good, but definitely not worth the price. We split the upside down key lime pie for dessert, which was pretty much key lime pie filling with some graham cracker crumbs on top, with a macaroon. It was ok, nothing spectacular. I think there is a reason I've never seen this place crowded. Average expensive food, and our waitress was just unpleasant.

The back room, which can be rented out, is amazing! It is right along the river and really cool with the loungy furniture and nice bar. The only thing is it is an awkwardly narrow room so it was a little difficult to host a party there.

2012-08-28,4.0,"After meeting up with some new friends to take a boat cruise, we needed some sustenance, so someone suggested Quay.  Despite a really prime hour of 1:15pm, we managed to pull tables together in the front area right as you walk in to accommodate our large party.  What, 1:15pm isn't a reasonable time to be eating lunch/brunch?  It is when you drink like I do. So first off, this place is gorgeous inside.  The dining room was swanky.  The walls were textured and looked like waves.  The hallway to the bathroom had a mirror at the end that made the place look like it went on forever.  I also hear there is a patio on the water, but it was closed for a private party.  There was also a huge bar area with tons of TVs on any sporting event you could want.  Really modern looking with silver and wood bar stools.  Consider it a step up from your usual divey sports bar. On to the food.  Our waiter had to take care of our entire table of 14 people.  Instead of being overwhelmed he went into extreme efficiency mode.  He would bring a split of champagne and some OJ and tell us ""I'm going to serve these other drinks and I will be right back to open this bottle for you.""  He told you exactly what was going on so you didn't wonder what was going on in all the chaos.  Good job waiter!  Not to say that service didn't take forever, but it wasn't this guy's fault because he was busting ass. So the menu made me want to really pig out even though I knew I was in store for a big dinner that night.  Breakfast items like bacon and eggs, waffles, oatmeal, etc were available, but so were lunch items like crab cakes, burgers, salads, and soups.  I was sold on the chicken and waffles served with gravy and cabbage slaw.  The chicken was bone in fried and not too bad for being in Chicago and not in the South (hehe).  But the pickled cabbage slaw... that was a really bizarre addition to the dish.  No need for it and no likey - just push it to the side and pour the maple syrup on.  Someone else ordered the mac and cheese that had pulled pork in it.  Dear God, did they find my two favorite comfort foods and put them together???  They did!  It was creamy, rich, somewhat spicy which was a great surprise, and with shreds of pulled pork all throughout.  Now this is the shit right here.  And, AND you can get it as an entire entree if you want.  Just saying.   Mimosas were life restoring as usual.  The bellinis were advertised with peach puree and we really wanted one of those but they were sadly out of fresh peach puree and were using peach schnapps instead so we passed.  Oh and I seem to recall it being Pepsi products only.  Ew.  Gimme Coke products! Give the Quay a try for brunch when you are in the area.  Try some mac and cheese and see if they have the peach puree for the bellini.  Then watch some football on the TVs!",0.9965,0.805,0.157,0.038,0.5405331510594668

My friends and I just headed back to the lounge for drinks, where I ordered The Meanest Flower from the cocktail menu. It sounded good, but it smelled and tasted like ammonia! Yuck! We had a cheese plate that was so-so. It came with champagne jelèe that was really sour and did nothing for the plate. Our server was pretty good though, which I did greatly appreciate.

The music was GREAT, and not too loud. We both chose to begin our dining adventure with a soup. I chose the Chilled Asparagus soup and the BF had the soup du jour which was a chicken saffron. The Chilled Asparagus soup is officially my FAVORITE thing to eat......delicious, light, and balanced. I almost ordered more soup instead of my entree. The chicken saffron soup was delicious as well (judging from the one taste I was allowed to have :) ) but the asparagus was better. For my entree I chose the sea bass that was cooked to perfection, seasoned well, and sitting upon a small bed of fingerling potatoes and spinach. The BF had the filet which he said was cooked just as requested and seasoned exceptionally well. After much discussion we decided to indulge in dessert and were not disappointed by the pistachio cheescake. Our slice was served with a type of greek yogurt ""whipped cream"" dollop, rosewater honey, and a few cherries. Need I say more!! The combination of flavors was light, tasty, and unexpected.

2012-07-08,1.0,"I was so excited to try this place after reading local media reviews. WELL not being a member of the local paparazzi media hype machine our experiences fell far short of the claims of excellence. The Forth of July, 8pm reservation before the fireworks We thought we were safe in not being in the middle of a busy time. The place was finishing off the early bird tourists -  first clue. We show up 10min early for our reservation and are immediately seated by very welcoming hosts. Note to self: watch where they seat you because some tables are very close and awkward as the host and servers like to travel the tight squeezes.  Whoever designed the space was way to focused on design and not functionality. Kind of like their website... annoying to navigate. Why can't I download a menu??? Without working for it????? I own a webdesign company and am completely perplexed by website owners who pay thousands for a website that only works for IE 16.7% of web browsers, the other  34% Firefox which I use cannot use the website.   Clue two - 20mins into being seated our server skids up with a canned excuse ""sorry I was held up at the bar"". Any dinner that starts with an excuse is not gonna end well. Was he drinking, cause he sure wasn't getting drinks for the tables that were empty and leaving. He is a bit peeved that we did not memorize the drink menu we were never given. As he did not either for wine by the glass why are we the bad guys. Yippee he will now get us some water.  Our waiter comes back with our drinks and takes our order. I ordered the Chilled Asparagus soup and a dinner salad with extra chicken. My hubby ordered the salmon medium. I received the soup within minutes. it was pretty good. Now we wait.  Wait, Wait, Wait some more, Mind you, tables that were seated after us were receiving their meals and 1 or 2 were cashing out the checks. We keep watching our waiter go past take care of other tables, go here go there, refuses eye contact with us. My hubby gets up to got to the restroom... code for I am gonna talk to the manager. He comes back, still nothing. I get up to go to the restroom and normally I would stay out of it, but seriously... when everyone who came in after us is getting steaks and burgers... & my hubbys salmon and my salad are now taking an HOUR to show up, I feel the need to be vocal especially when he was ignored earlier. The manager proceeded to tell us ""so sorry, it is because of the holiday"" Really??? The dining room is empty & YOU MANAGED TO SERVER OTHERS. Don't lie to me. How in the world do you handle weekends???  I would have never been this annoyed if our server would have just said ""whoops, I forgot to put in you order"".  All I need is a simple ""aw crap"", we all do it, own up to it. Mr waiter, don't avoid my eyes, I was not looking to be mean, I was looking to laugh because I wanted to make sure we had something to joke about tonight and on our next visit.  So our meals were now rapid fired at us. And our waiter totally avoided us.  I got a bunch of wilted lettuce with a couple of cherry tomatoes & nine pieces of chicken. My hubby got his Salmon skin side up (yuck) & way under cooked. What place serves the Salmon skin up? WOW - sorry to have been horrible enough to care about your time and make a reservation, show up ten minutes early, make our decisions as soon as your waiter felt like showing up.... YEP----- we deserved this.  So I go to the restroom..... This is my TOTAL check of a restaurant quality (wish I did it first)  No toilet paper, no soap, and running out of paper towels. I told the hostess who showed distress at the situation, but the manager whom I spoke with earlier seemed to feel I was just being annoying. I find bathroom hygiene in a place of business is fairly telling. If the owner or manager does not find it important to keep the bathrooms clean... how are the rest of the facilities??????? We live in River North and won't be back & as you can tell I am gonna tell my story far and wide.  I hope all the folks from the burbs make it across the river instead of other places when you seem to have zero love for locals in the slow Jan & Feb months when you have treated your neighbors terribly.  Disclaimer:  Normally we will pay our bill and go on without complaint & often tip waiters/waitresses that we probably should not. However poor their job performance, they do depend on tips and they did to the best of their ability try to serve us. Due to not receiving our meals after and hour at Quay we were forced to complain. The manager offered to comp our meal without our asking for being comped. In no way did we ask for being comped, all we asked for was to be served what we ordered. I always will complain about a filthy bathroom. All in all  - If you are coming to the city and looking for a nice family friendly place to eat... this is not it. If they treat a couple the the way they treated us, I can not imagine they will be family friendl",0.9718,0.834,0.093,0.073,0.5536682728647014

2012-02-27,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place a lot more than I did. There really just was nothing impressive about this restaurant and considering the price, they need to be better than average. My husband and I came here Friday night for dinner for restaurant week. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived so we grabbed a seat at the bar where we watched 6 blacked-out guys do shots and try to hit on other girls at the bar (who were there with dates). It was only 7pm and didn't seem like that kind of bar so I thought this was weird.  We only waited about 10 minutes before we were seated. We were taken into the dining room which was very well decorated - they definitely paid a decorator a pretty penny to get this place looking so nice. Going from the bar to the dining area, I felt like I was in a completely different restaurant. The two areas just did not go together.  Since it was restaurant week, my husband went with the restaurant week menu (which we had to ask for - ugh) and I just went with the regular menu. He ordered the spicy tuna tartare for an appetizer, scallops for entree, and some chocolate ganche bar for dessert. I ordered the seared ahi tuna for an entree.  The spicy tuna tartare was very good and unfortunately the best thing I ate here. It was a good size portion and tasted fresh. As far as the entrees went, my husband's scallops also came with short ribs which seems like an obviously odd combination to have and he agreed it was. It came with a parsnip puree which was good but he said went well with either the scallops individually or the short ribs individually, but not both.  For my entree, the seared ahi tuna, I was disappointed to find it was really lacking flavor. The fish was very fresh, but it really needed some sort of soy or sesame glaze since there was nothing. There was a mango chili sauce served with it on the side but it tasted pretty bad and really didn't go with the fish at all. The tuna came with a black quinoa and mushroom salad, which I thought tasted better than the tuna did. For a $30 entree, it really should have been a lot better. For dessert, my husband had the chocolate ganache bar. He loved it. The service was prompt but I must say our server was pretty awkward. Everytime she asked us how everything was, she'd take a really long pause after our response as if our response of ""everything's good"" was unexpected or insulting. Definitely ranks as one of the most awkward servers I've ever had. Overall, this restaurant seems to be suffering from a bit of an identity crisis - trendy restaurant or casual sportbar? Whatever it chooses, it needs to make its #1 priority to improve the taste and flavors of their food.

2012-02-13,2.0,"Been thinking about this review since I ate here a few months ago.   Very mixed feelings about this place.  It was an interesting night, and why the review may be long. When we were deciding to go out for dinner, and were looking at a few restaurants, we were a little hesitant about seeing quite a bit of negative reviews for Quay.   I usually throw out the 5 star and 1 star reviews.....both are ridiculously extreme.  Quay did seem to have quite a bit of low reviews, in particular regarding the restaurant's management and its identity crisis.   We ended up rolling the dice and booking reservations for 4 on a Friday night. My wife and I arrived early and had a drink at the bar.   The bar is interesting....very nicely designed and decorated, but has about 300 flat screen TVs all over the place, showing various college sports, soccer, nascar, obscure sporting events.  I noticed no one in the bar was watching tv.....it seemed ridiculous how many monitors were up there....actually kinda ruined the ambience of the bar.  Drinks were very good....some interesting cocktail choices.    When the rest of our party arrived, we were seated in the dining room.   Without going into explicit detail, the seating process was a debacle, and poorly handled by the management.  In fact, in my years of dining out, I've never been treated like that....it was bizarre.  Made me think:  ""the management here has no clue what they're doing"". We gave the management an earful about their bush-league behavior, and figured we were a marked table.   They ended up bringing out some free appetizers, which was a nice gesture, so we ready to forgive/forget and move on.   Now let me say, the dining room is beautifully decorated, one of the nicest ones I've seen in awhile.   The food itself is good, and priced appropriately....not the greatest dining experience, but decent.  Waiter was a little bit of a pompous prick, but nothing I've haven't seen before.  No biggie.  What ruined the dinner, was the private party they stuck in the middle of the dining room.   It was quite bizarre....not sure if it was some holiday party, but they had brought their own professional photographers and spent most of the dinner taking pictures in various poses (duckfaces included).   No one famous (or very photogenic for that matter), so we figured it was an office party.  Trying to eat with flashbulbs going off in your face every 2 minutes got extremely old and irritating.   Why they were not placed in a private room is beyond me.  Again I thought:  ""Management is clueless"".   When we left, we noticed the club room w/ DJ in the back.....looked very cool and was packed.   It seems the restaurant is trying to be 3 things....sports bar in front (utter failure), fine dining in center room (mixed success...needs better food and control over private parties), and club in the back room (successful).   To sum up my review:  I won't be going back here, as the folks running this restaurant need to leave the restaurant business....and take their 300 flat screens with them.   I would also be very surprised if this place is open a year from now.   Kind of a shame, beautiful rooms and decor.",0.9908,0.787,0.135,0.078,0.5130648148148148

I could not eat my $27 scallop because it really was like eating scallop sprinkled with sand.

Overall, it was a great meal that left everybody quite full and satisfied.  The food is priced pretty reasonably for the area, as well.  Our party was impressed that the owner was present and walking around, checking on tables, and even sent out the chef to answer my inquiry about the forbidden rice dish.   For a venue that has seen a number of restaurants come and go in the last 5-7 years, I think Quay is here for good and I am excited to return.",0.9983,0.712,0.23,0.058,0.5969749736167647

Duck Confit Nachos: good flavor, but very rich...the cheese sauce can overwhelm. Applewood Smoked Bacon Burger: Far and away the saltiest burger I have ever consumed -  Bacon is ground into the patty, which makes it unbearably salty and reduces the bacon flavor, surprisingly. Additionally, smoked Gouda is a salty cheese...however, I'm not sure I was actually served smoked Gouda on the burger...tasted like Gruyere, which can be a substitute for Gouda - I was a little insulted because no one told me Gruyere would be used instead of Gouda. Lobster BLT: Tasted sort of like seafood salad. Had clumps of lobster that were not bad, but it was smothered in a mayonnaise sauce, which killed the flavor.  In addition, the toasted brioche the sandwich was served on did not mix well with the other flavors - you sort of tasted garlic bread and then seafood salad. Upside-Down Key Lime Tart: Good, but not memorable.  Went well with the Moroccan mint tea I ordered.

One of my friends ordered a scotch, and she told him that it wasn't part of the bar package for the party, but, she would get one for him, her treat.

Sadly, both of our meals had pedestrian components. I had the Quay omelette, with Maine lobster, black truffle, and herbs. It was supposed to come with passion fruit hollandaise; I generally find hollandaise offputting even in sensible applications, but a properly cooked omelette should be sufficiently custardy as not to require additional richness. When my omelette came, I immediately understood why it needed the sauce - the eggs were cooked half to death, *especially* for a French-style folded omelette. Perhaps I'm being too picky, but I can make a damn good omelette at home that costs me around $1.50, so when I pay 10 times that for someone else to make me an omelette, I expect absolute perfection. My mother had the salmon and bagel plate, which looked impressive but was very awkward to eat due to the brittleness of the bagel chips. Coffee was decent but somewhat heinous in price at $3.

People have written about the three faces/sections of Quay - the front bar, the middle dining room and the back lounge. I liked the vibe of the bar with lots of TVs, nice bench seating and plenty of high tops. The entire place is well designed with funky and new age style. This is especially true in the rather small dining room.

I really like the menu - it's approachable, to the point and affordable. Many of the items focus or feature seafood but there's a good balance of meat and vegetable selections too (lots of bacon usage). The four of us all had different tastes that night so we were able to see and try many things. We started the meal with two flat breads (one mushroom and one tarte flambe), tuna tartare and the surf and turf trio of sliders. The flat breads were nice and the appropriate size for a starter. I actually liked the mushroom and goat cheese more than my flambe (i.e. bacon and fromage blanc). Our trio of sliders were ok but not amazing. the lobster roll wasn't bad and I liked the burger but not a huge fan of the short rib. Erica and I split the pork chop special and the served it to us on two plates without asking (a nice touch). Ari and Tali ordered the ravioli and grilled ahi tuna. I didn't taste the tuna but I heard good things. My bite of the ravioli was quite good. Our pork chop was very tasty: well cooked, well seasoned and full of flavor. It was served with slightly under-cooked brussel sprouts and an interested mashed vegetable (potato I assume). I'm glad we shared the plate because I would have been tempted to eat the entire serving. To round out the meal we ordered sides of garlic potato puree and mac and cheese. The potatoes were great and full of garlic (and butter I'm sure). We ordered the mac without the pork (lots of pork on the menu) but it still came with the chipotle seasoning that should have had a stronger warning label for how much heat it carried. I'm a huge fan of spicy mac n cheese but this needed more clarity for the unsuspecting diner (read: Erica). Oh well. We had a nice meal with pretty good food and good value. Our service was friendly and attentive and our drinks kept coming (though my first cocktail was a bit of a disaster). We all had plenty of food but no one felt over stuffed. There were other items worth exploring so another visit isn't out of the question. The back lounge area looks very cool with great views and seating areas. The location doesn't do it any favors but hopefully people decided to hang out post meal.

2011-10-19,3.0,"My boss and I share a birthday.  So for his birthday, I let him take me out to lunch for my birthday and I chose Quay. Quay has a nice little lunch menu.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and it was really good.  The calamari was cooked to perfection and was tender, not rubbery, while the breading was crisp, not greasy. I ordered the vegetarian ravioli and it was missing something...some oomph, I guess.  I had been off of carbs for about a month and would have probably treated some stale old Wonder bread like it was a 5-star meal, but this ravioli was a bit bland.  I had also been off the cheese for a month, so thank god this dish was covered in peccorino. My boss enjoyed his crab louie salad and we shared a banana tres leche cake, which was good.   It seems like Quay is trying to figure out it's niche.  There is a lounge, a sports bar, a dining area, and a cool looking patio area overlooking the river.  It's a great spot, but they should focus on one thing and do it well.  Maybe punch up the food a bit?  Or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.",0.9888,0.772,0.201,0.027,0.5923076923076924

The cool breeze along with the warm sunshine through all of the windows created a perfect ambiance. Run down on the food: Slider trio - 1 lobster salad slider, 1 pot roast slider, 1 cheeseburger slider. All were terrific. Would order this again. chicken salad - so-so. As a previous reviewer noted the grilled chicken on top of the greens was somewhat dry.  Would have liked more dressing.  Would not order again. Seasonal fruit french toast - Fabulous. Four thick triangles of french toast with a delicious fruit topping and powdered sugar. Syrup came with it but was not used because the fruit topping was enough.  Would order again. Mac and Cheese with pulled pork - The menu said it would be spicy and it was what we considered very spicy.  It is kind of an odd brown color.  Large serving size. Toward the end of the meal my sister noticed that most of the pulled pork was in the bottom of the bowl and so once she mixed it up, the pulled pork seemed to calm down the hot spice somewhat.  It makes a good side dish but I don't see how anyone could eat that entire bowl as an entree.  Very rich and very spice.  Would not order again. Dessert  s'more chocolate cake - chocolate perfection. strawberry tiramisu with pistachios - delicious and would order again. I consider this a trifle.  I don't quite understand how it is connected to 'tiramisu' but it was good.  Would order again. Service was excellent. Prices are reasonable.

The oysters were so fresh and the three sauces on the side were good. My favorite was the cocktail sauce. just very classic and gave flavor without overpowering the oyster. My boyfriend has the ahi tuna and that was great. a fork cut through it like butter. there was a crust on it that spicy, but very flavorful, but my favorite part of that dish was the seaweed salad. I wanted an entire separate bowl of just the seaweed salad. I had the Diver scallops (4) which came with braised pork. The scallops were very tender with a nice crust. The braised pork was also tender. It's the size one one scallop and is used more as a garnish which i thought interesting, but in a good way. Lastly i had the Goatcheese Cheesecake and that was by favorite of everything. When it came out i thought it was ice cream because it sits on the plate as a scoop of cheesecake with puree on one side and crunchy on the other. Very fun to eat since you can scoop and dip to make your bite instead of it just being a regular piece of cheesecake. Service was awesome. Very nice and friendly. Informative without being overwhelming and very accommodating.  Looking at the menus online confused me because it looks like there are a lot of menus, but there are 3 different rooms for you to dine in. the Sports bar area, the dining room and then the lounge.

Sounds like some may feel that Quay is suffering from an identity crisis, but I challenge those to consider Quay to be 3 destinations all wrapped up into one.  Ask yourself how many other places are there in the city where you can enjoy sports in an upscale bar, dinner in a fine restaurant, AND relax in a lounge with a view of the water and high-rises.  For those that come to mind - isn't it wonderful to have it be a potential destination for many reasons? I think so... and Quay is no different. The decor, ambiance, noise level, and general feeling in all 3 areas of the restaurant were as expected - felt like 3 distinct areas. The dining room food was all very good.  The waiter mentioned that they are currently showcasing different daily specials, so a call to the restaurant on the day you plan to dine sounds like it will reveal their new items.  The crab cakes (special) was tasty, the fish & chips was cooked to perfection and flavoured wonderfully.  The sliders are definitely not to be skipped - short ribs, lobster, and a mini-burger - we loved them all.  The flour-less chocolate cake was, by far, the best of that type of cake I have ever tasted.

So whatever mood your in, Quay has something for you! I chose to eat in the dining room with 2 of my friends where we went all out with a several (aka every possible) course meal. We started with Scallops and Calamari. The Scallops were amazing - perfectly cooked and sitting on a bed of greens (spinach and mushrooms I think) that had also been cooked to perfection. The appetizer was small though, so I would keep this one all to yourself! The Calamari was great too - instead of marinara it came with a nice and mild aioli. It was a great combo and plenty to share. We followed that up with some Caesar Salad and Clam Chowder - both had a unique flavor but were really delicious. For the main course, my friends (who'll I'll call R & L) got Quay's take on Fish and Chips while I went for the Vegetarian Ravioli. I was not a fan of the ravioli but L thought it was okay. The Fish and Chips on the other hand were really good. 2 pieces of cod, 2 pieces of breaded shrimp, 2 fried scallops (YUM!) and shoestring potatoes all hit the pallet well. We finished up with the S'mores Chocolate Cake (great decision!). It was the perfect size for sharing since we were all stuffed from the big meal. The cake it self was SO rich and delicious. It came with graham cracker crumbs and two roasted marshmallows on a little skewer. Definitely adorable and tasty all at once. As far as service goes, I was really impressed. The server kept our drinks refilled constantly, they took away plates and silverware promptly but replaced just what we needed - despite our many courses I never found myself stuck with used utensils and always had enough replaced for the next course. (That may seem silly, but I hate when you have to put the spoon you just used on the table to save it for dessert and I hate when you have to sit around waiting for a fork while your food grows cold. So it was nice not to have to deal with either.) The server noticed that I wasn't a fan of the ravioli and offered to bring me something else, when I declined, he without hesitation took it off the bill. I didn't even have to ask!

He apologized to us and explained that all he could do was apologize. We told him that we were still unhappy, the implication therein being that his response was not to our satisfaction.  As we were leaving, I pulled Vince aside and told him that I, too, am in the service industry and that in my opinion the only person from whom it would be acceptable to hear, ""I'm sorry and all I can offer you is my apology"" is from one of the general staff, i.e. the waiters and waitresses. He responded to this with more apologies and no action. This place is relatively new but well past their first week of having opened. The teething phase should be well behind them.

2011-08-15,4.0,"So, happy there is another fun place to go in Streeterville (in addition to D4).  They definitely have 3 different environments in one place.  The front bar is more a sports bar...lots of tvs. In the middle, is the dining room, a little more upscale, but people were still in casual attire.  And in the back, along the river inlet, is the lounge which has its own bar and table area and tvs. We opted to dine in the lounge because it was the most relaxing and casual.  There are 3 menus as well...which I think should be cut down to 2 menus, a bar/lounge menu and the restaurant menu.  You can order off of any menu.  The menu has a lot of wonderful options.  We ordered the Flatbread with the Applewood Bacon & onion and it was fabulous.  Really thin.  Not too heavy with the cheese and the bacon's smokey, apply flavor was perfect, not too overpowering.  We also had the Surf/Turf Trio but opted to have all three Turf.  Mini Cheeseburgers.  They were really good.  Not greasy, good flavor.  We had wine as well....very good.  But the menu said $11 and we were charged $12...not a big deal, she said they are constantly changing the menu and it may not have been updated...just told her so she would be prepared because some people might cause a stink.  Very good experience and service.  Looking forward to going back!  (went on Sunday around 6:45pm)",0.9922,0.787,0.183,0.031,0.5648290598290597

2011-08-12,3.0,"We live right next door to this place so we were pretty excited to try it. Overall I'd have to say it's just okay. We went on a Friday around 8 and were seated right away - we chose to sit in the back dining room which has a really nice atmosphere. Our waiter was very pleasant and they give you bread that is pretty good. The menu leaves a bit to be desired as it doesn't have many choices - we both went with the burger which comes with a side of fries (doesn't say so on the menu) and we ordered a side of the mac and cheese.  Our food came out pretty fast and it wasn't until it did that we realized the waiter never asked us how we wanted our burgers cooked. The burgers were medium rare, which is fine because they were pretty juicy, but thought it odd he didn't ask us. He didn't bring out the side of mac and cheese with the rest of the food so we figured 'oh it'll be out in a minute,' but about 5 minutes later, we figured all was lost and we had enough food with the bread, burger and fries so we just decided not to say anything. The weird thing was that he didn't say anything to us either ""oh sorry I forgot, do you still want it, etc.""...it was like the mac and cheese just went into that place where lost socks go. It didn't show up on our bill either, which is great but adds to the oddness that he probably saw that we ordered it and just decided to ignore it... So! my knocks on the place is the VERY limited menu and the server seemed a bit green in the field of food service (didn't ask us how we wanted our burgers, lost side dish). Also, the fries were nothing to write home about. But the place has a great atmosphere, decent service otherwise and since it's still pretty new...I'll give it another try sometime, maybe in the lounge to watch football. They also just put in an outdoor area...but I haven't seen anyone sitting out there yet.",0.9507,0.836,0.107,0.057,0.6107936507936509

Our server was very delightful and knowledgeable of the menu.

2011-08-09,3.0,"Went to Quay a little a week or two ago and had an okay experience. Food was pretty good. A couple of sandwiches (good, but a little overpriced I think), an appetizer (tarte flambe - very good though it needs a thicker crust) and a couple of drinks (good beer list, really bad wine list for the ""nice"" place it's trying to be). Service was, as someone else noted, awkward... our server was nice, but she asked us if we knew what we wanted to drink as soon as we sat down (give us a second to look it over, please...), checked in on our food before we had a bite of it for every course, and sort of sat around after we finished ordering like there we wanted more even though we were clearly done (uh, we just ordered an appetizer, two entrees and a couple of drinks - what else do you want from us?), and messed up the check at the end. She was just sort of a weird presence all the way through dinner. Maybe just a new server - the place is new still. Everyone was really friendly, our awkward server included. Even the bussers who cleared our table were pleasant and event cracked a quick joke. The place looks awesome, though, as previously mentioned, the different music in the different parts of the restaurant do overlap each other - mainly the bar and fine dining area. Love the open kitchen and the ambiance is neat. The bar and the lounge areas are the best part, though I'll be interested to sit on the outdoor patio and see what that's like. As a side note, they HAVE to use those TVs for NFL Sunday Ticket or I'll be super disappointed. The bar area was MADE for it. Streeterville sorely lacks a good place to watch football... and, no, Lucky Strike does not count. We'll go back, but expect to see some improvements as they find their place. As for now, it was just okay, especially for how much we paid. D4 is much better in every aspect and has a better value too.",0.9973,0.724,0.224,0.052,0.5868101469237833

2011-07-30,2.0,"You know how they say everything is in ""the details""? It REALLY mattered here at Quay.  From the moment I walked in, there were issues. I had a 7:30 reservation this evening. My party was running a little late so I told one of the two hostesses to tell my party to meet me in the back bar where I'll be waiting. She said ""yes"" and I went my merry ol' way to the back bar near the river. (And by the way, the whole ""disjointed"" thing I read about... I get it now after walking through the entire restaurant. I can see why other reviewers think it's confusing.) I waited til about 7:45 and I still didn't hear from my friends. It turns out they were waiting up front even though I told the hostess that when they check in under my name to tell them I'm in the back. My party said the hostesses did not tell them any such message.  We're heading to our table, but as we approach the dining room, we were stalled a minute because there was a chair missing for a 6-top table. They brought the other chair, we get sat, and immediately our server comes to ask what we want to drink before we really had a full minute to look at the wine list. The only menu we had in front of us was the dinner menu sans spirits & beverages. A few minutes later, we receive a bread basket which was actually quite good. The sourdough was your standard quality of bread, and the herb crisps were very flavorful.  The dining room from what we could see was 1/4th full when we sat down at 7:45. When we left at 10:15 (yes, we were there 2 1/2 hours and no, not because we wanted to), the dining room was near-full (this is important in a minute). We order our food (Our server was not very enthusiastic by the way. In fact, he looked irritated right from the minute we sat. Our friends tried to crack a few jokes to get him to smile and apparently, he was NOT feelin' it!) and waited... and waited... and waited... Probably 45-50 minutes into waiting, our server told us that there is a ""larger party in the other room and our kitchen is backed up right now."" He apologized, but we still waited... and waited... and waited... From what I remember, our food came out around 9Ish PM. The wait was so long, our friends had to add more money on the meter for their parking spot!  The food came out and he was temporarily confused on who ordered what. I ordered the burger with no bacon and my friend had his with. When he mixed it up, he said ""just kidding."" Normally, I'd shrug it off and laugh too, but he seemed so irritated throughout the night that even that bothered me.  While we were eating, some of the staff were refilling linen napkins behind us. Apparently there is a storage right behind our table. I mean, come on, we're eating here! What an awkward place to store napkins... so close to diners. The flow of the dining room was also a mess. There was a huge pillar behind our table and then another large table was behind us so our server and both parties from both tables had to walk all the way around to get back to their seat. The flow of the dining room was off and needs reorganization.  In terms of the food itself, I ordered the burger with aged Wisconsin cheddar. The pretzel bun was delicious, I must say. It was very buttery and toasted just right. I asked my patty to be ""medium"" but it was more ""medium well."" The seasoned fries were pretty tasty. The wine list was surprisingly smaller than I expected, but I had a refreshing pinot grigio with my meal. My friends ordered the Amish chicken, caesar salad, beet salad, burger, and the cod fillet sandwich [apparently it's off the bar menu but the server still let my friend order it as a dining room entree]. My friend said the Amish chicken was moist and the flavors were spot on.  While all of us were stuffed, typically (knowing this group) we still order a little dessert. Well, not so much this time around. We were there so long that by the end of dinner, we were exhausted, didn't want to wait another hour for our dessert, and/or had to move on to our other plans for the evening.  So to wrap this up, the food was fine. Our server (though probably not entirely his fault) didn't really make for a pleasant dining experience. He seem slammed (with tables), annoyed, and the other dining room staff looked confused. Even walking around the hallways, (presumably) managers were managing the floor, but often I'd see them doing ""damage control"" stuff more than anything. The hostesses also seemed off their game. From what our table gathered, this restaurant couldn't handle the traffic. This might be a restaurant internal communication or understaffing problem?? The interior design was impressive overall (the front bar is more sports bar in feel, the restaurant in the middle is quite chic and ""urban"" and the back bar near the river is trendy and boisterous.)  So, would I go back? Well, I try to give other restaurants (particularly new ones) a chance, but with Quay... the answer is simply ""no.""",0.9946,0.841,0.107,0.052,0.44301574607425653

And if you don't know what that is you're in good company! According to a Wikipedia search (yes, at the table) I learned that it's basically a flatbread. Normally they are sweet but this one was savory -made with smoked apple wood bacon, crème fraiche and ricotta. After discovering that I'm a pescatarian the waiter offered to have 1/2 of the flambé sans bacon. The bf enjoyed his scallops with braised short ribs.

2011-07-18,4.0,"I stopped in here for a light dinner with my brother tonight. The space is large and beautiful, if a bit disjointed.  There are three separate rooms.  The front area is centered around a spacious bar, has open leather seating and high stools with flat screen TVs-- an upscale sports/gastropub feel with a perfect view of the better-than-food-network kitchen.  The middle room is a pristine white tableclothed formal dining area, and the back room is a more casual, colorful and playful bar overlooking the Chicago river.  Each space is gorgeous, but nothing seems to pull the whole thing together, except for the all-black clad staff. (An aside: Why are people against pants?  Didn't anyone ever tell you tights are not pants?  Ah well, if you got it girl, flaunt it!) I didn't do drinks tonight, but I can say, the food was pretty great.  Pricey as downtown will always be, but obviously fresh and made with care.  We ordered the cod burger ($12) and the beet salad with herring and arugula ($11).  The cod was well cooked, the batter perfectly seasoned, the bread appropriately soft, and the fries salty and crunchy and velvety on the inside.  But my favorite was the salad, and I'm not really a salad girl at all!  Slices of red and yellow beets were topped with arugula, watercress, cucumbers and pickled herring, then drizzled with olive oil.  It was so good I will have to try and duplicate the flavors at home.   The other dishes that passed me by also looked delicious, in particular the flatbread with bacon and what looked like a well dressed satay. The place is huge and I wonder if they will get the foot traffic necessary from the close-but-not-close-enough hotels in order to pay for the real estate.  The crowd that walks home from Navy Pier is not exactly going to stop in for a $15 martini either...but who knows?  I think if more people check it out they won't be disappointed with the food or service.  Good luck!",0.9954,0.79,0.173,0.038,0.5148163265306124
