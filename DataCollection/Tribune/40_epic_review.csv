2016-02-15,4.0,"Sometimes I'm late on writing my review on some places.  When I finally got around to this one I was definitely surprised to see they are permanently closed.  I would love to know what happened!!!  My lady had a groupon that was about to expire at the end of 2015, so we tried to make a reservation one day during Christmas week but to our dismay we got a recording saying the'll be closed that whole week.  That left only one week to use it which we caught it for a good deal I believe we bought it for $38 for $100 for food&drinks.  We ended up making a reservation for the following week.  The day we went it was super cold!!!  I remember that because we parked a block and a half away from the place, finding parking could be a little difficult in that area.  When we arrived we quickly waited on and seated.  They had a lower level, upper level, and the rooftop.  We followed the hostess up the stairs to the upper level(there's also an elevator) were we were seated at a table for 2 along the wall were its like a long bench chair with a row of table for 2 chairs in front of the it close together. I'm mentioning this because we were seated right next these two ladies which we could every word of their conversation, and then they sat another couple to the right of us.  It felt like were eating at a table with strangers.  As far as the waiter he was ok, not great not bad.  We we choose the lamb gnocchi as a appetizer which was tasty!!! For the main course I choose the duck and she had the salmon.  They both were good but not out of this world.  I feel like you're basically paying for the ambiance.  All in all it was nice!",0.9404,0.829,0.109,0.062,0.5184920634920636

2015-12-27,4.0,"Very tasty food, well presented, with average service, but at a price above typical River North prices.  We came in for an early dinner on a weekend and were able to be seated immediately, and food and drink menus were brought shortly.  Beyond that, it was a hassle to find our waitress and ask about a dish, get silverware, get and pay the check.  Seemed almost as if the bar and drinks were so important that the sit down tables could be ignored for long periods. For food we got the Wild boar papardelle and the Seared Diver Scallops.  Both came out with beautiful presentation (view pics), and both were home runs on flavor.  For the papardelle the  pumpkin polenta and tart cherries perfectly balanced the savory meat flavor, and added a nice sweetness to the dish.  The scallops came with a salad essentially, of kale and apple pieces and puree.  I don't like scallops, but I would definitely eat the fixings all on their own.  We ended with the Brandy Creme Brulee.  It was served unlike any other creme brulee I've had, portions dished out on gingersnap cookies with slices of kumquat and white chocolate adorning then, and then lemon honey drizzled on top for good measure.  Very tasty and unique, but I think I enjoy the regular presentation more, and Epic's size was smaller than normal.  They also have a tasty Schofferhofer grapefruit beer, better than Stiegl Radler .",0.9905,0.806,0.166,0.027,0.5105270655270655
2015-12-24,3.0,"I have to admit, I was a little prejudiced against Epic just because of its name. As a classical scholar, I get prickly when I hear that word used to describe, say, an ice cream cone, when it was originally intended to describe a twenty-four-volume poem in rhymed meter with a cast of characters even longer than the Star Wars credits list.  Still, I tried to keep an open mind, and I had a good time at the private reception in conjunction with the ASLA convention. It was Bond-themed, but we chose not to dress in costume; thankfully there were plenty of others like us. Instead, we drank martinis, ate appetizers and played table games with fake money (which, I have to say, was a thousand times more fun than gambling with real money -- I just can't bring myself to enjoy that!) Our dealer, at the blackjack table, was loads of fun, and the interior seemed sleek and modern, though it was too dark to see many details.  As far as the food and drinks go, again, it's hard to say since we didn't pay for anything or order from the menu, but I can say that the specialty cocktail of the evening was pretty unimpressive (cheap champagne and juice) and the appetizers were fantastic. Our favorites were the tuna tartare with avocado relish, though the tiny hamburgers and crab cakes were also delightful: every detail, from the dollop of sauce to the perfectly-crusted exterior, was perfectly on point. Dinner here might not be epic (except for the bill) but I think it would be pretty great. Someday maybe we'll give it a shot!",0.9957,0.74,0.215,0.046,0.5858024691358025

Both plates were well prepared and full of food. We also ordered sides of Mac and cheese and papas bravas- both amazing dishes! I briefly mentioned, before getting the dessert menu, to our waiter that it was my boyfriend's birthday and after we ordered dessert the brought our plates (the carrot cake is to die for and the vanilla bacon fudge ice cream was so yummy!) and a huge sparkler for him!

I did see one person juggling though. I don't think that is very fair to false advertise to draw people in the doors. Also, I don't see how it could have been sold out and there was not 800 people in the club at any given point. Actually by 1:30am the second floor was almost empty besides my group and 10 others! Also, when I arrived, it was as I wasn't even on the list and the staff were so disorganized and finally let my group of 22 in and just stand by the door.

The portion FAR exceeded our expectations and each sandwich was tasty. Someone commented that their fries are like old McDonald's fries. Um, not true at all. They are a thick-cut potato with seasoning. Sparkling wine is only $5 for a heavily-poured glass and their craft beers are a smokin' deal too!

Service was friendly, attentive, and semi-formal, in a refreshingly pleasant way. The restaurant was well staffed and our meal flowed with great timing.    We had a starter, entrees, and a side dish, each of which was incredibly tasty. Fresh bread arrived after we ordered (and was scarfed down soon thereafter). The food was so delicious and perfectly made--taste and presentation were on point. I'm sure the menu changes regularly, so posting what our specific dishes were probably won't be too helpful.  I feel like the environment matched the food really well too--elegant and trendy but not presumptuous, all nicely done. We sat at a window table, up on the second floor--a good view of the block and of the rest of the restaurant.  They treated the birthday part of our meal so nicely too--firecracker with dessert, chef-signed menu to take home, and kind well wishes.

I had a pretty good cocktail that had avocado in it so thumbs up for that, check that out. For dinner I had the pork macaroni and cheese and the mint and ricotta ravioli. The waiter promised two homemade, large sized ravioli, but I've had ravioli, and you essentially get two normal sized ravioli with some veggies to fill out the plate. The ravioli did have an egg in them which burst out runny when you stuck your fork in so that was pretty neat. While I'd call it tasty I wouldn't order 2 raviolis again for $23.00.

The calamari was slaughtered with batter & many pieces were just empty shells of fried nothingness. The shrimp was sub par. The focaccia was just wilted bread with cheese & tomato sauce. Ok so no.  Entrees. Two of our 3 steaks were mostly gristle. Mine was served sliced & dry. The potatoes on the plate were hilarious: like salty mealy stale disks. Basically they were old McDonald's fries. The pork mac & cheese was meh. Kinda tasted like faux smoke sauce. This is still a mystery.  The Brussels sprouts were great though. So there's that.

We asked for more and they supplied us with more without a fuss. We move onto the entrees he got the steak and I had the salmon. I say my salmon was okay, but they left the skin on which I usually don't prefer. I have to say it was good, but just didn't knock my socks off.

My group was 10 girls, classy, 30s-ish, and many of us in the bar and restaurant industry ourselves. Upon arrival no one greeted us. we were rushed in separate groups in a stuffy hot elevator to the rooftop, which was already full from a corporate group. The manager didn't even bother to greet us, ran ahead to the booth, and simply pointed at it. (in his email he had promised a larger one by the Dj, which we did not get for some reason).  The server came out and told us they only had Moët champagne. (We had previously set up 2 of the house champagnes- which were equivalent to the price of the 1 Moët.)  We went with it anyway, and she proceeded to pour out the entire bottle to 4 girls. Nearly over flowing the glasses.  There were clearly 10 of us all seated in the booth, she should have spread out the champagne so we could all cheers together, but instead tried to sell us another bottle. (We had a bottle of vodka, so half the girls had to cheers with that.) One of the girls went to the bar and noticed many different champagnes in the coolers. Come to find out, they had the house champagne the entire time!  One of the girls consulted the manager on this and he didn't seem to care. Apparently lying to customers and up charging them is standard at this place. Furthermore, the atmosphere felt outdated- cramped, cement floor, small and tight booth. litter strewn around the place. The servers were not very put-together. It looked like they chose their own outfits, so you couldn't even tell who was a server or not. Very unprofessional.  Fortunately we had another reso at another rooftop to follow. So we wasted no time hanging out here. Bottom line- awful service. Awful place. Rude and unaccommodating management.

After she goes back up to get another one of my friends who is more fair skin , all of a sudden another manger comes out and thy can locate the reservation and this was just a misunderstanding.

We ordered two appetizers - Salmon and Scallops, and Picnic on the Patio - Pork Belly Carnitas (although I believe we ordered the lobster roll), Herb Roasted Chicken, and the 3 bean green bean. Among all the food, Salmon, including the cucumber, was the best! Pork Belly Carnitas was tasty, too. As I mentioned above, I'm sure we ordered the lobster roll, but we ended up getting the pork belly carnitas... My guess was that we have been debating which two to pick among Pork Belly Carnitas, Lobster Roll, and Herb Roasted Chicken, and our server got confused... However, the pork belly carnitas was delicious, so we happily took it lol  The Herb Roasted Chicken looked delicious, smelled great, but tasted okay.... the chicken leg was a little dry. I can imagine the beast couldn't be any better... The remaining two, the scallops and the 3 bean green bean, both are bad to me. I don't like the spice on them at all.

Still good though, I recommend it, especially because the veggies it came with were so good.  The hostess and the waitress were both pretty good and helpful so there's a plus.  However, they definitely should not allow for opentable reservations at 9:30, if it's to turn the music on louder and the lights off as if to tell us to hurry out of the lounge area by 10:30.  I do not like to be rushed when I eat, but if I have to leave I would rather have one of the staff politely invite me to hurry a bit. It was very rude and my friend and I did not appreciate that one bit.  If tables need to be cleaned out by 1030, 11, have the last possible options on opentable by more around 845, 9, not 930!

I don't understand why this waitress did not take this seriously. But not only did she not take it seriously she became snippy with her when she questioned what was in food items! Seriously!!! It's not her fault! After this she became the most inattentive waitress. We order an appetizer or at least we thought we did. However it never came and she never check in with us in between ordering our meal and it arriving. Once our food arrived and she finally came over (instead of talking to all the other employees at the bar) we inquired about it. She said she didn't know we actually wanted it. What? That's why we ordered it! She didn't really apologize or care.  Normally I give people lots of chances and I am very understanding but she was down right horrible. I would not recommend this place solely on the service. Also let me end by saying this was a Thursday evening and not busy at all.   As far as the food. It was ok.

2015-06-08,5.0,"PICNIC ON THE PATIO River North is a flood of great restaurants and entertainment in the area. Recently Chef Dan Marquis' rolled out his new summer menu and it is called Picnic on the Patio. This is a perfect place to have lunch with a co-worker, friend, spouse or tinder date. Luckily I am married so I do not have to worry about tinder but this would be a great way to have an expensive looking lunch for two but it is not going to cost you an arm and a leg. The new menu lets you select two main courses and one side for only $18. This is plenty of food for just two people plus it will look like you are spending a ton of money on the date but you are not really. They also have two other options of four main courses and two sides for only $36 or six main courses and three sides for $54. Not only is the food affordable it is completely fresh and it tastes fantastic. Chef Dan Marquis' also owns a family farm with his brother. I believe that the farm is only located about 30 miles from downtown Chicago. Many of the food dishes and cocktails include this fresh produce from the farm. I just simply love that. Not only are we going farm to table but the chef is involved in both. I spoke with Chef and he told me that this cold weather has produced a lot of kale on his farm. I of course had to have something with kale and had the kale & spinach dip with Hawaiian bread. I loved how hearty the kale was in the dip. This was one of my favorite dishes of the day and I can not wait to have it again. Since I was on a picnic I knew we needed to have more of this amazing food but we also needed cocktails. The restaurant offers great house made non alcoholic cocktails with fresh herbs and fruits. They have a Wild Blackberry, a Watermelon Ginger and a Basil Ginger Lemonade and all three are priced at five dollars which is great for a refreshing summer drink. I must be honest I loved the Basil Ginger Lemonade so much I had the bartender throw in a shot of Tito's Vodka. I know it is lunch but it is also summer and this drink screams summer. Another favorite dish of mine was the Spicy Pork Roll. The only way I can describe it is a creative spicy Cubano Sandwich. The toasted sandwich has braised pork, serrano ham, pickle and a jalapeno radish slaw. The jalapeno radish slaw was out of this world. The sandwich had such a nice kick to it. I will be having dreams about this sandwich tonight. The sandwich also came with a cute basket of French Fries. The potatoes were fresh and still had the skins on them. I started dipping my French Fries into the spicy red salsa that came with our Chips and Salsa dish. Yes I was cross eating but I was not double dipping my fries. The chips were cooked perfectly and were fresh out of the fryer. I liked the guacamole that came with the chips too. The red salsa was that perfect authentic variety that you find in Pilsen. One day I am going to find out this recipe and start making salsa daily for myself. The herb roasted chicken was another favorite of mine. It was covered in fresh herbs, a lemon dressing & topped with arugula. The skin had a perfect crisp going on and it was so flavorful. I can not tell a lie but I ate the skin. Please do not tell my doctor but I am sure he would have eaten it too.  I loved how moist and tender the chicken was on the inside. Sometimes chicken can be over cooked but not here.  The tomato-basil focaccia was great. It had oven roasted tomato, fresh mozzarella and a basil pesto on top. The bread had the perfect mix of a crispy bottom and fluffy soft bread in the middle. Throw on the amazing toppings at this focaccia is great to share with anyone. As you can see this picnic theme is starting to take off, but I needed a blanket on the roof so I could take a nap from all of this yummy food. But before I threw in the towel I needed to hit the seafood. It is truly not summer without a lobster roll and the version at EPIC did not let me down. It had the right amount of celery, red onion and tarragon. Again I found another favorite here. I can't go wrong. We decided to finish our lunch time feast with some Diver Scallops served ceviche style with carrots, yuzu, coconut, jalapeno and scallion. The dish was very refreshing and had a fantastic sauce. I am not sure what the sauce was but it worked perfectly. We also had the Ahi Tuna with watermelon, radish, lime basil and tequila. This dish was very refreshing and it had tequila which makes the dish even more exciting. So if you are looking for a perfect way to spend your lunch time this summer then I highly recommend you hightail it over here. The new summer menu will have you not wanting to go back to work. Next time I come back I am going to make this a real roof picnic and just bring a blanket. I am sure they will let me eat on the ground. Right? Chicago has many options when it comes to dinning. I am so happy to find a restaurant that cares enough to use the freshest ingredients direct from the chefs own farm.",0.9998,0.772,0.225,0.003,0.6142940500707489

2015-04-26,2.0,"What a disappointment! I've been to Epic 3 or 4 times over the years and my dinner last night was such a bummer. I took 5 friends who were in from out of town and excited for a nice meal. Fortunately we enjoyed each other's company and the drinks were good, so the night wasn't a total bust. Starting with the good - decor is nice, servers were friendly, some of the dishes were excellent - highlights being the beet salad, crispy sole, and the sides. The biggest disappointment was the service. In theory we should have had pretty good service, we had a waiter in training and a more experienced waiter... you'd think that with 2 it would be good, but while they were friendly, it was some of the worst service I've had in a long time. I'm usually eating out 3 nights a week, so I think that says a lot. Everything took SO long. Taking our drink order, bringing our drinks, starters, entrees. We had no interest in dessert because we were so irritated. The restaurant was shockingly open - maybe 50% of seats were open? The waiter in training was nice, but clearly not very experienced. It felt like it was his first time at the rodeo, which would surprise me for a restaurant like Epic. Overall food didn't feel worthy of the price. I'm not cheap and will regularly spend over $100/head for dinner (and often much much more), but for the service and inconsistency of food it was a miss. Some dishes were over-salted, which is just silly. Also annoying was the person that appeared to be a manager who ran around all night with an earpiece and never stopped by our table to ask how things were. He didn't have that busy of a place and we were clearly there much longer than other tables who came and left while we were there. I should have talked to him myself, but was just not in the mood by the time we left. I rarely leave reviews of 2 or 1 stars, but I couldn't bring myself to give 3 or more. Since I've had some great meals at Epic over the years and they have a great rooftop I will keep an eye on reviews with the hopes that this was just a fluke. I'm not ready to say steer clear, so my advice is to read the more recent reviews and look for trends. I'm hoping this was a 1 night fluke, perhaps they were understaffed.",0.9905,0.76,0.168,0.072,0.5367016317016315

The short ribs and the parsnips and the red wine reduction with no acid or salt to balance the dish.

We got in and got bottle service, which I hate doing because you get raped paying a crazy amount for a bottle you could of gotten at Costco and all they do is walk it over with some sparklers. Our bottle service girl was...well, I'll just say it, a b*tch. Your basic blonde girl. I forgot her name and kept calling her ""Candace"" all night which probably upset her even more. Also told the girl that was helping her out that my entire party did not like ""Candace"" and would have preferred her as our bottle service chick but she couldn't because of something. Whatever. ""Candace"" kept over pouring our drinks, you know so we coukd buy another, so one of my friends told her that we'd pour our own. Although she was unfriendly, she was smart enough to continuously ask me, the drunk birthday girl, if I wanted another bottle. Mind you I wasn't the one dealing with the servers or the bill. Eventually from what my friends said, that tricky girl finally got me to order another one, which I seriously do not even remember saying I wanted it.

I wanted to dine upstairs but forgot.  The restaurant space (1st floor) is dominated by a large bar, booths along the walls and traditional table/chair arrangements. The ambiance is contemporary, dimly lit with top 40 music in the background. I felt like I was in a nice bar rather than a fine dining establishment.  Our server was attentive and pleasant. We started off with drinks and ordered the Epic Mule and Pierre Delize, a bubbly wine. Later on I ordered the Hollander. For an appetizer we ordered the Artisan Cheese Board, which came with an arrangement of four hard and soft cheeses, fig and apricot terrine, and 4 paper thin crostini drizzled with honey. The cheeses were ok, I really enjoyed the fig and apricot terrine. Our server immediately noticed 4 crostini was not going to be enough and promptly brought us more.  We ordered the Wagyu Top Sirloin served with parmesan pomme frites and I had the Ahi Tuna served with braised white beans, roasted tomaotes, and baby argula greens. We also ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese and Charred Rapini. The tuna was cooked well and paired well with the braised white beans. The mac and cheese was rich, topped with bread crumbs and extremely tasty. I could eat that dish everyday!  The rapini was cooked and seasoned well.

I didn't understand what took so long because like I said it was a slow night. The drinks were great and the drink menu is wonderful though.  The main entree I ordered were scallops. The scallops were cooked very well but the ravioli it came with was cold and rough. Really ruined the entree in my opinion. Same with the appetizers. The green tomatoes felt as if they were sitting out too long.  Overall I enjoyed the place but they need to work on getting the food out while its warm and the waiter to get to the table quicker.

I get stoked about a place, I even put red lipstick on, only to be disappointed.  The place itself is beautiful, well at least the downstairs. (Hence my generous three stars) I never got to see the upstairs as it closed at 12 (stupid chi laws). I was curious to go see it but I was stopped by a very unpleasant traffic light of a bouncer that stated that even though it was 1130 I couldn't go up. I smiled and said, ""I have heard about the patio and frankly just wanted to see it, I will come back in 5"". That last statement was very true but he didnt believe me. We came for my friends 30th bday, I wasnt going to abandon the wolfpack, just wanted to take a peek at the damn patio. What a nazi? They had a small but fun cocktail list. I like wine tho so I opted for that. Sadly the wine list was underwhelming. I am sure I have seen better wines at the convenience store while waiting to fill up my tank. As far as food goes, my friend got the sliders and I didnt order anything. She hated them as they were raw inside but I totally loved her leftovers. If I return again is because I am still curious to see the upstairs otherwise it was a very forgettable place. Not even the quadruple D boobies of the asian bartender will make me return.

I CALL THAT SAVINGS BUDDY!  Well i was also trying to apologize to my lovely boyfriend which i have put through hell and back. The pictures looked nice, the reviews were ok and i liked their menu. When we arrived, I thought we were arriving at some night  club. They had men in suites and ear pieces at the door and checked our ID's before entering.  We were seated right away. Now i thought this place looked pretty sexy but it was dark as hell in there and LOUD. I never understood why restaurants turn the music up so loud. I ordered the rack of lamb and my stud muffin ordered something with scallops. It was pretty busy in there so our food took a while to  come. We had two drinks each before our food arrived. By that time i was ready to do something else LOL j/k but i was pretty much buzzed. My lamb was actually pretty good. It was prepared very well. The scallops my boyfriend ordered were made to perfection. Our drinks were AMAZING as well but service was (insert comment of bad service). Our server was so absent mentally that i was wondering if she was high. She would look straight at me and i would say something and she would walk off.

2014-07-07,3.0,"Epic menu descriptions of mediocre food. Came with a $100 groupon and we ordered the following: An oregon pinot noir  Octopus Swordfish Hangar steak Mac and cheese side The octopus was strange since it was served on a bed of squash puree. I get they are attempting to fit in with the other cool river north spots, but this combo was just odd. It's not that good, sweet/salty mix like garrett's popcorn, it's a weird mushy + overly grilled, chewy mix of textures that was almost gross.  If you would've put the swordfish plate in front of me and said it was tofu, you could've easily fooled me. The texture and taste was identical to tofu. I have nothing against tofu and i use it all the time in my cooking, but I didn't expect a $32 dish to taste like the $1.99 block I get at TJ's. The sauce and veggies were amazingly flavored. Again, it was just an odd, rubbery, thick texture for what was described as a grilled fish. Hubby had the hangar steak and said it was cooked perfectly. The issue here was that the menu described his steak accompanied with bacon hash but it was regular-ass potatoes with 3 little bacon bits.  The mac was good. I actually liked the mac better than my swordfish but it didn't have truffle or any other exotic ingredients that vouch for the $11 price tag.  We did have a bottle of an Oregon Pinot Noir that was pretty good and made the food def more enjoyable. Also, service was great. The place is pretty empty so the staff didn't seem overwhelmed and was able to give everyone pretty good service. The best part of this place is the decor and the fact that you can grab a drank before, after or whenever at their rooftop. It's not the best views of the city but it's pretty good for River North.

Greeting and initial contact with the server was friendly and attentive. The server went through the specials and answered questions thoroughly.  After we placed our order is when service started to slip, perhaps the server decided upon us not ordering adult beverages that we were being cheap. Just because you're not drinking doesn't mean you won't be ordering a starter or dessert, which we did. Servers need to remember not everyone drinks, and/or people might be drinking a bit later at another venue, as was my plan. My dinner was very good, I had the Hanger Steak which is a regular item on the menu and it was cooked to a perfect medium rare, for the beets apricot salad was tasty it could use a few more beets and should be named beets with dried apricot, I was looking forward to fresh, for dessert the bread pudding was delicious, it comes with a bourbon sauce which is properly described on the menu, and you taste the bourbon so if you're not a fan it may be overpowering of a flavor. We weren't offered additional bread while the tables beside us were, nor were we checked in on as much, getting the check and having it picked up took awhile.  The only other thing of note is with as large as the room is, the tables are a bit close, they could use to lose a table here and there to make the dining experience more enjoyable.

Our server didn't seem to know anything about the food and just looked bored. Now the food: my dad ordered a burger that was basically raw in the middle. He had to take it back to the kitchen and recook it. He apologized but offered us nothing like a free appetizer or dessert or discount. I had the chicken cesar salad. It was pretty good, except the chicken was also undercooked but not as bad as the burger. It's not a terrible place but the service could use a boost.",0.9729,0.773,0.177,0.05,0.7132122507122508

We started with cocktails, the G6 tequila cocktail was tasty and the avion and prosecco one was very refreshing.  Our wines were quite good too, I had the cabarnet and my friend had the meritage, both excellent with the duck.  Below is what we ate, in order of yumminess: -duck three way - hilarious to say and even better to eat!  The duck confit was full of flavor!  I liked the originality of the dirty rice, but would have rather done a classic duck fat potato side -kale salad - the kale is nicely blanched so you're not chewing for days, and the dressing is tangy and delicious -asparagus wrapped in speck - this was delicious, although it's overpriced for two spears of asparagus -foie gras - not the best foie I've had, but it was good.  The little fried dough balls are a nice pop of texture! -crab cake - again, not the best I've had but it was tasty.  I wish there was more of the asparagus puree, which was yummy! For dessert we had the trio of ice cream/sorbets.  The blood orange sorbet was to die for, I could eat a whole bowl of it!  The strawberry basil ice cream and rasberry rhubarb sorbet were so-so.

We shared the grilled swordfish as the main meal and also had a side of zucchini squash. The grilled swordfish came with hearts of palm and big pieces of leek, with a delicious cream sauce (the only thing delicious here). The zucchini squash was a major disappointment. When it came out it looked unappetizing and tasted really bad. The basil on top was not fresh, and the cheese sprinkled on top tasted old. We didn't want to waste money so we used the swordfish's cream sauce and mixed it into the squash. For dessert we got the tres leche cake. Also not made well: dry and not much flavor, it was obviously made like a week prior to serving. Also, there were way too many servers just standing around between 5-6:30pm.

I'm definitely coming back to order another Loco-jito, to try The Master (which I heard is even spicier than the Loco-jito, and to try other menu items.

I see, now, why the outdoor patio on the most beautiful night of the year, and on a friday, was almost empty, with the exception of the hillbillies that hit and cursed us, and a bachelorette party, and maybe one or two people at the bar.  Food was ok, though.  The bartenders were very nice.  This place really belongs in some strip mall in the suburbs.  Sad.  It used to be so good, with a nice clientele.  Now it's just Jersey Shore meets Duck Dynasty.  I feel like I can't even give it one star, but I will because the appetizer was ok.

I was a little worried to see the bar so empty and wondered what dinner would be like if there was nobody there. Being March Madness though, I'm going to assume people were at sports bars rather than a more swanky place like this. We were promptly seated at our reservations time upstairs, where I was pleased to see many more people. They were busy, you just couldn't tell from first walking in. To start we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare which was very fresh and the avocado in it really gave it some extra flavoring. For my entrée I ordered the Grilled Swordfish which may be some of the best fish I've ever tried. It was served atop some cauliflower and leeks and I think some sweet potatoes too and brought me back to my honeymoon in Hawaii where fresh fish was everywhere. This was absolutely perfect, I would recommend it to people who are even a little hesitant of fish (as I am). My husband ordered the Hanger Steak which comes with bacon on it, our waiter said it was the most popular item on the menu. And it definitely didn't disappoint. Nothing could have made it better. For our sides to share, we ordered the Mac & Cheese (out of this world goodness, not too cheesey, just right) and the charred broccoli (the only thing that was just ""ok"", nothing special). Because I had mentioned to our waiter that it was my husband's birthday later that week, he surprised us with a free dessert of bread pudding and a huge sparkler on top. It was so nice.

2014-02-23,2.0,"Ate at Epic last night with a fun group of 6 and in a nutshell, it was extraordianrly average, at best.  Luckily, the average food and terrible service didn't ruin our great time. This is coming from someone who eats at a lot of places in the City, is not picky, very forgiving, and likes to give the benefit of the doubt.  Lets start with service. There are waiters who know what they are doing, and those that are newer and just don't know. We got one of those waiters that  just didn't know what he was doing.  Pretty shocking and unexpected after reading the reviews and knowing the type of place this is ""trying to be"".  It was sloppy. He did not know the menu at all and couldn't tell you or describe any of the dishes. Weird. He had to read the special word for word from his card. He was very slow and, most annoyingly, he disappeared for long stretches as we sat with empty drinks. This happened on 2-3 occasions, where we all looked around and wondered where our waiter was. Nothing epic about that.  Lets talk about the food. My food was good, and everyone else seemed to generally  like theirs as well. LIKE is the key word. It wasn't bad but no one loved there dish.   The tuna appetizer was good, but bland -just VERY average.  We got 2 of those. The shrimp was ok -again not great. My caesar was really good but had too much dressing which I scraped and worked around.  (I woundnt pick at any other restaurant for too much dressing, but at a place like this, I have to). I did  really liked my duck. It was cooked and seasoned perfect and the rice was delicious. My wife liked her fish but said it was way too buttery. Deserts were better. Rice pudding was amazing and so was the banana thing.  So, in the end, the food was VERY average to good. The space is amazing, the decor was pretty but the place definitely lacks an identity.  The service was not good. This place is pretender.   Over priced, no identity, bad service, slow service, good food. There are so many great places to eat in the City and I would never, ever go back to this place and suggest you look elsewhere as well. Far from ""Epic""",0.998,0.726,0.226,0.048,0.6144402673350041
2014-02-23,2.0,"Okay, so my girlfriend and I got the Groupon, just because we figured we would try a new place and it seemed like a good opportunity. We had a 7:45 reservation and were sat immediately, even though we arrived approximately 10 minutes early.  We had a very nice table for 2 right next to the window overlooking Hubbard on the 2nd floor... very cool. I typically prefer my liquor neat or on the rocks, but decided to take a chance on the Epic Mule and my girlfriend opted to go for the G6... ...So here is the thing about Epic that is going to be a recurring theme.  Epic is a good restaurant trying to portray itself as a great restaurant but comes just short of executing on the details.  Epic wants badly to be a high end restaurant, but just never gets there. Our drinks were a prime example, my girlfriend enjoyed the G6, no complaints.  The Epic Mule was good until I got halfway through it and figured out it was very poorly mixed; all of the syrup and ginger beer was at the end.  I did end up having another one but only drank a bit past half of the second one because I could tell the second one was equally as poorly mixed as the first. For our appetizer we went with the Crab Chowder, which was very good, and the presentation was nicely done. It was after the appetizer that we started to notice the service was slightly lacking.  We rarely saw our waiter, only 3 times the entire visit.  While two different men who were walking the floor in suits each came to check on us and the busboys kept our glasses full, getting a drink took easily 10 minutes from time of ordering it. For my main dish, I went with the Ahi tuna with risotto, which was the fish of the day and again, very good.  It was a little light on whatever sauce was on it, but I only say that because the sauce was very enjoyable and rounded out the flavor extremely well.  My girlfriend had the short ribs, which were short ribs.  They weren't bad but they weren't great; extremely average, again, not up to the price tag.  Presentation definitely had some effort behind it, for both dishes. For the sides we went with the Mac and Cheese and the Whipped Potatoes.  Mac and Cheese was great, but the potatoes, again, were just potatoes.  This is the recurring theme; the things they do well are great, but everything is just so hit and miss. I cannot comment on desserts because we received our main dishes about an hour after being sat.  We finished our dishes waited and then were even sitting without plates in front of us for a good 15 minutes with no sign of our waiter to inquire as to whether we wanted anything else.  At this point we were two hours in and had somewhere to be so I had to track down one of the men in the suits to run our check.  Shortly after I asked for the check, our waiter did come by to ask about desert but did not seem overly concerned that we were unable to have anything because of the, we'll say distracted, service.  Again, the waiter was polite and knowledgeable, just absent. After the Groupon and tip, I was out of pocket $155 on a $205 total bill.  $155 was on the upper end of what I would pay for this level of restaurant, but if I was stuck the full $205 I would've been extremely disappointed with the value.  Again, Epic is not a bad restaurant, just a bad restaurant for the price, especially when you can throw a rock and hit a place like Mercadito or Hub 51 at a similar pricepoint. Basically, if you can get the Groupon, I'd say it is worth giving a shot and not a bad date night, but if you plan on paying full price, you may feel like you've been taken at the end.",0.9979,0.814,0.149,0.037,0.5255134515408486
2014-02-17,2.0,"Came here on a week night with my boyfriend and this was both our fist time trying out the restaurant. The location is fairly easy to find and what is unique is once you go inside you can be escorted into an elevator to get to the 2nd level dining area. We were seated in a nice corner table which allowed for some privacy. The venue can get a little loud since we had large parties surrounding us.  I started with a couple of oysters that were very fishy so I won't be getting those again. tried the Pork Belly appetizer which was a small portion but tasted pretty good. the dish was accompanied with lobster, Brussel sprouts and apples.  My Main Entree was the Hawaiian Escolar. Now beware if you know about escolar it is an oil based fish so if you eat more than 6 oz you are in for an upset stomach. I was really worried this would happen so I limited my consumption to about 5 oz. Apparently this was still too much for me. I liked the black rice that supported the fish. Anyway I was in for a stomach ache the entire evening after I ate.  My boyfriend ordered the duck three ways and he said it was pretty good and did not have any complaints with the food.  For dessert we ordered the Coconut Macaroon Napoleon and Chocolate Banana Stack. Both were HUGE. I felt the chocolate banana stack was too sweet and it was so large and overwhelming. I couldn't finish this. The Napolean however was delicious! I would recommend it highly! the layered vanilla cream was just delightful!",0.9916,0.781,0.176,0.043,0.6056896551724137

We came here for a birthday party on Saturday night, I gave the car to valet and I was glad to see that there was no line since it was pretty early in the night (10:30).

He was all bundled up and made a girl in a dress wait 10 minutes for no reason what a chump!  So we finally walked in and the place was very nice and very sexy, dim lights, huge mirrors behind the bar, I can't take away from the interior of the place. But then I went to the bar to order a couple of drinks that's when I met one of the rudest bar tenders who had a terrible attitude til I put him in check really quick.

We came here after getting stuffed on Mexican and drinks at Mercadito but it was only like 10pm so we wanted to do something afterwards and this was the closest rooftop to us. The weather, for October was super warm but it rained earlier in the day so we thought that could be a little problematic if the cushion seats were all wet.  Anyways, this place isn't exactly happening on a Saturday night as there was no line to get in and the place was pretty empty. For my friends and I that's a positive since we felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. It's smaller than most other rooftops that I've been to, it's also obviously not as high up as the ones at the Wit or Trump hotels but it's just small and cozy you could say. I was right in terms of the seating arrangements as all the cushions seemed to be a little wet, but with a few drinks at hand, you could really ignore that. Overall, the view wasn't spectacular, Epic i just a good place to get some drinks and get some fresh air in the river north area. Would I go out of my way to come back here? Probably not. But I don't regret going as we had a nice time before that perfect weather started to turn. And that happens quite frequently in our city. For drinks our small group just got some beers which were reasonably priced as well as some tea and our server, who seemed to have a cold herself, was really sweet and accommodating and even brought me decaf upon request and my friend just had regular. The prices for food also seemed reasonable and they have mini lobster rolls and sliders on the menu, which is perfect munch food for me.

A coworker of mine had a very similar story with her experience at Epic, in which the female server also was way more tentative to her male customers than the group of women she was with, and they all struggled to order drinks and food from the waitress.   As most bars on Hubbard, a large percentage of staff are hired based on their looks, and not on their service quality.  We were willing to spend a decent amount of time and money there, but being ignored by the staff at a restaurant should never be an issue to drive away customers.  This is a very inefficient way to run a business, and in a highly competitive market, I would strongly suggest choosing a different establishment who will treat their customers with more respect.",0.9614,0.803,0.129,0.067,0.4420388615216202

2013-05-15,4.0,"Overall Epic was a great spot for drinking, dining and lounging with just a few service flaws. We went here with a group of six to celebrate a birthday. It is a nice spot for a special occasion with a dramatic dining area and outstanding bar on the first level with many interesting, creative drinks. We started at the street level bar and had a couple creative cocktails including the first drink I've ever heard of that has avocado puree in it. The dining rooms are upstairs, way upstairs. The first level is an open area with a chic, industrial vibe featuring a very high ceiling. Up another flight of stairs is the loft area that has comfy booths and a great view of the space. We had a raw hamachi to start. It was delicious, bright and spicy. We also had a lobster agnolotti small plate. Agnolotti is much like a ravioli. The lobster meat was in chunks and the dish was sauced with a roux-based lobster sauce that had the flavor of a bisque. The dish was really delicious.  One of our party ordered a steak and I ordered the rack of lamb with eggplant and lentil masala. Here's where we had a glitch. I ordered the lamb medium rare and the steak was ordered medium well. They mixed those up. The major glitch here was getting the attention of our waitress to fix this and how it was handled. Despite the fact that the place was buzzing with personnel the actual waitress was difficult to flag down. When we did we explained the problem and she offered to re-fire the steak. I pointed out the problem with that - the steak was sliced. You can't simply re-fire a sliced steak. It has to be remade, allowed to rest then re-sliced otherwise you'll dry the thing out. She never offered to simply do the right thing, which is to replace the steak by remaking the entire dish. We elected to not have the steak and it was removed from the bill - which is really considered no concession at all. When the lamb came back the second time it was perfection. The lentil and eggplant masala was delicious with hints of Morroccan and Indian flavors, a beautiful compliment to the lamb.  After dinner we went back to the street level bar to find that it had filled up with a vibrant lounge scene crowd so we stayed for a couple more drinks before heading to a dance club.  The food we had here was terrific. I would have gone 4.5 stars (if Yelp gave us half stars) except for the service issues. One thing you have to do as a server is check back within a couple minutes (literally 2 minutes) to see if the dishes were done properly.",0.9958,0.836,0.143,0.021,0.5171636650386651

I met this lovely young lady in a conference in Atlanta and we seemed to have hit it off.  She agreed to meet with me again, so as you can see I may have done something right.  While we were planning our trip to Chicago your restaurant came up on the radar.  Unbeknownst to her I made a phone call to the restaurant where Jason had taken on the challenge of making her night an incredible one.  That is all I cared about and that is all I asked of him.  He took care of the rest.  He called me and emailed back and forth ensuring that this experience would be an incredible one.    I commend him for his efforts and for everything that the restaurant did for us that evening.  The Chef and Jason worked together on planning an incredible meal and pairing the wines to which were absolutely perfect.  Jason's customer service was above and beyond my expectations that even on his day off he came in to meet myself and Ashley.  Sarah Baumgart also made it a point to introduce herself and ensure that our whole evening would go as previously planned.  Last but certainly not the least, I want to let you know that Sophie was our server and she was incredible.  She stood up to the challenge as well.  Ashley and I are both in the Service Industry and I am probably one of the worst critics of servers.

The downstairs is sort of really pretentious and clubby - but the hostess and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Eat upstairs to have a hip, lively atmosphere. They will play low key EDM over your dinner, but it goes well with the interior design. The elevator shaft has been decorated as a piece of art and compliments to red and metal decor. The have somewhat risqué menu items like duck liver over waffles, mushroom salad, and an entree of duck cooked 3 ways. All of these I just mentioned are very tasty, but the braised rib is to dye for, as is the sea bass. The homemade chocolate ice cream was a great end to all of this food. The real stand out for me about Epic is how well the meat was cooked. The outside is seared perfectly while  the reductions aren't overwhelming to the point where they appear to masking the meat's flavor.

The food was mediocre, but being a veg, I really do not like to dish out bad food reviews since I am so bias.   The portions were small (or shall we call it ""tapas"") and the service was just as sceney as the cliental they hope to attract.

So, you'd expect excellent customer service - right?  Hah.  I asked the server if they served fresh grapefruit juice (if I'm paying over $10 a drink I want my fruitjuice to be natural, not ocean spray --highly processed and dyed with cochineal).  She then radioed the manager and he came us to see if we were overly intoxicated.  I suppose they are not accustom to someone caring about processed grapefruit juice (whatever).  Every interaction here was just strange.  This place did an awful job at welcoming us and making us feel at home.  We left and shared the warning we had ignored to the next group of patrons.   Hey, River North, you're not better than the rest of the city.  You are a strange combo of Wrigleyville bros, club hoes, and young professionals wanting some r&r via happy hour and conversation.   Be kind to your customers -- maybe this is the way to create a better model for longevity in your business.",0.8579,0.783,0.116,0.101,0.49603174603174605

This chic restaurant has so much potential, but their just ""ok"" cuisine left me wanting more. I went to Epic during Chicago's Restaurant Week. They provided a prix fixe menu for those who wanted to try a taste of what they have to offer. I concurred with one of the prix fixe offerings and shared a bottle of Tempranillo with a fellow tablemate.

2013-02-13,5.0,"Epic. Oh Epic.  Where do I begin?  For starters, this is one restaurant that successfully lived up to all the hype I have heard since its opening.  Judging by how hard it is to get a reservation at a decent time is a clear indicator that it is something special.  When you walk in, the ground floor level is a more casual but sophisticated bar scene.  They had VIP seating/booths for the high rollers with catchy dance music playing.  However, once you ascend the stairs to the second level, you will find the dining room.  Again, much like the ground floor, the vibe in the dining room is urban, trendy, and chic without being over the top.  The service is impeccable and I noticed right away that management was circulating through the dining room, check with every individual table to make sure that a good time was being had, and something I have not seen to often.   Because it was restaurant week, I knew I was going to choose from the pre-fixe menu.  I started with the shrimp and crab louie with avocado and tomato.  The seafood was so ridiculously fresh that it was no surprise to hear that Epic brings in fresh seafood every single day.  The shrimp and crab were sweet with their true flavors shining through because the dish itself was very simple.  I really appreciated the simple but fresh flavors and can honestly say that I have not experienced seafood that fresh in Chicago thus far. For my entrée, I chose the Braised Short Ribs with scallion-potato puree and baby carrots. The ribs were slow cooked and so tender.  Everything on the plate was paired and cooked to perfection.  The portion was also very generous and I had to take half of it home for the next day, not that I was sad about that by any means! My boyfriend (who opted for the regular menu) ordered the Pumpkin Risotto: wild mushrooms, pablano and manchego cheese, topped with roasted pumpkin seeds.  This dish was incredible. The risotto was creamy and tender and the toasted pumpkin seeds offered a nice crunchy contrast.  It was a surefire hit! For dessert, I had the Milk Chocolate-Banana Cake: Rum Anglaise with mango sorbet.  Who knew that combination would be such a winner!  I loved the chocolate/banana/mango pairing.  I felt like it was a dessert I should be enjoying on a gorgeous tropical island so far, which is a pretty good feeling when you're in Chicago and it's 23 degrees outside!

The most delicious part of this meal was dessert, not a big bread pudding type of person, but I would definitely go back for this. The bourbon sauce was perfect, great dessert! Besides the food not being great, the manager was not either. I questioned the salad and told him it was supposed to come with beets, which is why I had ordered it.

I, on the other hand, found it very tasty..and I'm not a fan of lamb. Paired with what tasted like raisins, some sort of nuts and Parmesan cheese.

It was even too much for me, so the rest of my party also got to sample. The main course was...nothing short of orgasmic. Truly. As an ""out of the closet"" carnivore, I LOVE good meat; and this was it. I chose the short ribs and enjoyed every minute of them. Perfectly cooked, melted in my mouth, just exquisite. Paired perfectly with mashed potatoes and carrots. Very rustic.  The final course was a miss. The cake tasted like it was out of a box and the mango gelato was...mango gelato. I was not impressed, particularly after my expectation were raised by my main course. The atmosphere was very ""downtown."" High ceilings, bricked-exposed walls, loft-like ambiance. Even the light. Huge floor to ceiling windows exposing the downtown highrises. Can't complain. Oh wait, yes I can! The music. It was a bit....one beat for me.

2013-01-02,5.0,"Epic indeed. Love the exposed brick throughout, high ceilings and grand staircase and huge windows. We asked to sit in the front room at the tables next to the windows looking out on Hubbard and it was perfect. Perfect place to dine with your date or go with a group if you are looking for a unique, elegant setting. We came on a Monday with an early reservation (6PM) and it was pretty empty. However, as we were leaving a few hours later, the place was pretty busy for a Monday night. I hear that on the weekends, this place turns more into a night club, but we didn't experience that. Food To start things off, we ordered the pork belly and it was the best I've ever had. Succulent, crispy, melts-in-your-mouth good! After sharing it with my husband, I secretly wanted to retract my entrée order and just order 2 more servings of the pork belly - fantastic! I decided to carry the pork theme through and ordered the apple-brandy glazed pork chop. The portion was HUGE and with braised greens and apple-cherry chutney that had such a unique flavor and paired wonderfully with the pork chop. Even the greens were excellent - not salty and flavorful. My husband had the salmon and he loved his meal as well. For dessert (it was my birthday after all), I ordered the s'mores tart and it was nothing short of amazing. Milk chocolate melted on a graham cracker streusel and toasted marshmallow ice cream! Get it. The best part about their dessert menu is that every month there is a featured dessert where all proceeds from that dessert go to a charity - what a wonderful idea! They also have a large cocktail menu and a HUGE wine list. I ordered ""the Passionate"" with passion fruit puree, agave nectar, and orange liquor and it was also very tasty. So much so that my husband ordered one too after having a Manhattan. Service Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and had perfect timing in terms of checking up on us. The bus boys were great too. We also liked that one of the managers came by to ask us how everything was that night.  Overall, we had a wonderful experience all around.

2012-12-06,5.0,"I see a lot of people complaining about there being old people, there being a line, or whatever. My review is based on our great experience we had for an early dinner (reservation for 6:30pm).  We came on a Monday, which is half price wine night (only bottles, not glasses). They also offered a four-course tasting menu for $48, with optional wine pairing for $70. I did not partake in the tasting menu, instead opting for the salmon ($28). It was very good, but we were even more pleased with the pork belly appetizer ($12). All in all, the food was excellent. The portion size of the entree was huge! The only slight let down I had was the sorbet desert (the flavors were pretty bland), but it wasn't bad enough for me to go down from five stars for this review. If you are looking for an elegant location with good service and good food, dinner at Epic is for you. It is very nice and the food is very good. Best of all, it won't break the bank (at least based on normal fine dining prices). Also, if you look on Open Table they have some 1,000 point table reservations that you can take advantage of.

The rest of it was faro, peas, corn and some very tiny pieces of what I think were lettuce or maybe something picked outside? Ok why was there corn in my mushroom risotto? The best way to describe this dish is the meal you make in college when payday is still 2 days off- you take every odd and end in the kitchen and throw together and slog through till you can get to the grocery.

If I am going to be paying excessively for a mixed well drink I would prefer some actual alcohol in my drink.

The service was very attentive, friendly, and professional, although at times forgot to bring the wine paired with the dish. The food, which is I'm sure is why you're reading this. For what you're paying, the wow factor just never arrived for me.   On a tasting menu from the chef, of four courses, none jumped at me. It felt like flavors were missing, textures were left out, and the courses small, even for a tasting menu. A tomato-based appetizer was good, but didn't have a fresh-clean finish which I expect from that sort of dish.  It was flat, and squishy, there was no change in texture.  The scallop was cooked well, the gnocchi that came with it was also very nice, although the sauce tasted way too butter-drenched. The lamb in the main course was cooked well, although was incredibly fatty, mouthfuls of gristle.  The dessert was a flour-less chocolate cake which sort of seems 2004-5ish, but the ice cream served with it was delightful. The cocktails were a bit heavy handed on certain ingredients, like bitters, and there were a lot of ""promotional"" cocktails, such as whatever the hell the new trendy flavored vodka is.  I understand why they do these, but it just left a lot to be desired.

Generally I thought the service was good, not fabulous by any regard but good. The hostess was friendly, the food runners and bussers were also nice. I expected more from the food which is reasonably priced for the type of restaurant it is but not so for the kind of food that arrived at the table. My 8 oz filet was more like 5.5 oz and I asked for it cooked medium, not medium well mind you but just medium, and it came completely charred on the outside and red on the inside. I know cooking steaks is tricky and that is why I don't usually attempt it myself, and instead I go to restaurants where people get paid to cook them. My friends were perfectly happy with their meals however. The drinks were very tasty albeit expensive but again- that is what we were expecting so no disappointment there. When we finished, we wanted to head down to the bar and we found it so packed that it literally took us 4 or 5 minutes to walk to the bar from the stairs, and then another five minutes to walk back when we had given up on ordering drinks. I personally believe that if you are going to have a team of doormen outside, then they should work harder on keeping the bar at comfortable capacity.

They've been friendly women, if rather unprofessional; one told us she'd drank too much before coming in that night, and the other revealed that they didn't carry a specific tequila anymore because the distributor rep got into a fight with the manager. Other busboys and managers who have popped behind the bar have done so with their backs to the customers, and usually don't seem to be in a good mood.  The food has been solidly average. Nothing has been disgusting, and nothing has blown me away. Popcorn at the bar has always been this side of stale. *shrug* I like the layout of the first floor (haven't been but there and Sky). I like the lighting, the design, the wood, about everything. I noticed a little spot which may work very well for a small party in the future.  Last time I was there, my friend and I went up to Sky as part of a scouting mission, as I plan parties for my team at work. While the people were an interesting cross-section - which I liked - the music was loud and bad and no employee was visible, but for one bartender. We went back downstairs.  I called them today to inquire if they take reservations for Sky. I was put on hold without being able to eke out a word. Okay, they're busy. This is good. When I wasn't picked up after 7 minutes, that wasn't good. I called back and immediately got the same person who put me on hold before, but this time she could help me. I asked my question and she told me to call Joe at what I assumed was a personal cell number. I asked her who Joe was, and she told me he's the guy that can tell me how to book a table at Sky.  Sigh.  So I call Joe, and he sounds like he just woke up (4pm). I ask him about reserving at table at Sky and he puts me on hold for a few minutes. Now I'm getting impatient. He comes back and tells me their table minimum and I thank him and tell him if we decide to proceed, I'll call him back. He says ""Yup. Bye."" and that's it.  We would likely go 2-3x higher than the quoted table minimum. I'm certain my team would like the space, and it's close enough to get to. But I have no faith that it wouldn't end up some kind of douchey disaster, so we won't be spending money there. I'm fine with coming in for drinks after work when it's chill, but I'm not going to involve myself professionally with people who openly act like they don't want my business.",0.9914,0.819,0.132,0.05,0.4298136645962734

I ordered a classic drink, gin on the rocks, which she drowned in lime juice. I was with a large party and I was only planning on having one drink anyway, so I just hung out for a minute to let all the arriving guests order before I asked for a new drink.  Our waitress got busy with more tables (she was the only one up there serving a few other tables), so I walked up to the empty bar myself to exchange the drink. I explained it had too much lime juice, and asked her to remake it. Then the drama began. She gave me the stank face and told me that I should have come to her earlier, because now the drink was watered down. I told her that wasn't the problem; the drink was too heavy on the lime, so I didn't drink it, which was why it was now watered down. It really wasn't enough of a big deal  to complain earlier; I was having a good time and would get the corrected drink sooner or later.   She told me, ""well that doesn't make any sense, but I'll remake your drink anyway."" The attitude was way too much for a two ingredient drink that SHE managed to botch, at an empty bar where she wasn't slammed with orders. I guess she was upset that I interrupted her disgusting indulgence of wolfing down potato chips behind the bar. She remade the drink with her pissy attitude, I thanked her (good home training on my part), and kept it moving. When I came to close out, she did not even address my presence and that of another patron (we were the only ones at the bar besides two dudes she had already served). We got the attention of our waitress, lovely young girl, who finally cleared our tabs. I spoke up to the funky attitude barkeep, and told her she was out of order for her response, and she just gave me more lip. On my exit, I learned that she had been rude to other patrons as well. So one of them and I shared her less than professional behavior with manager Agum, who apologized profusely.   Not sure if she'll actually be reprimanded, but I'm sure she'll never understand that it was her foul attitude that created the problem, and caused the omission of her tip. UPDATE: The next day, I spoke to my party host, and she divulged  a litany of issues that nearly everyone at our party had with this bartender.  I know Hubbard is notorious for being uppity, but the entire staff seemed pleased to serve us, except this foul attitude broad.  I would require a lot of coaching to ever spend money here again.",0.9731,0.818,0.114,0.069,0.4648594608700992

On all occasions, the service, drinks, and space was fantastic. Even at its most crowded there was still room to move and refresh your drink. The dj isn't bad either.

2012-06-08,1.0,"If there was a ""NEVER IN HELL"" rating they would certainly get two. A potential and eager customer should never have to chase you for business. Earlier this week, (Tuesday, June 5th 2012 to be exact) my best friend and I went for a site visit in anticipation of booking a table for her 25th birthday party Friday June 8th.  (Despite the very haughty greeting by the hostess) We had great drinks and welcome by the fabulous bartender Jen (who's the one that really sold us on the venue) and speaking with Sarah the general manager, we were ready to book cabana bottle service for their rooftop and bottle service for a table inside for after the roof top closed. We were going to order bottles Casa Noble Tequila (FAV, you must try it. Binny's has a sample set on sell :-) ) over 325 each. The VERY next day I called back to Epic to speak with the VIP Host Joe Dempsey, the hostess informed me that he wasn't in yet but that he would be in later that night Wednesday June 6th at about 8-9pm. She recommend that I email him for quickest response which I did as soon as I was off the phone with her. NO RESPONSE! I called back that same evening to speak with Joe at the recommended time only to be told by the hostess ""Oh, Joe is not in today. Try calling his cell tomorrow.""  Can I speak with Sarah then? ""She's not her either"" Okaaay.... (Still no reply to the email by the way) By this time my Bestie is panicking because she's already sent out information to all the attendees with Epic being the location and that we'll have bottle service all night. I called his cell  the next day (thursday). FINALLY I actually speak to this  infamous all power Joe. I explain to him our party plans and ask what I need to do so that this is locked in and secured. He tells me that he won't be able to confirm anything until he gets to work that night and he'll give me a call about 9:30pm.  HE NEVER CALLS I speak with the hostess on duty, Debra. I try explaining to her the situation and why it is imperative that I speak with Joe or SOMEBODY about booking this party! I TRIED to tell her the original plan was to have a cabana on the roof and a table inside but she kept cutting me off telling me the roof was sold out. OK I GET IT!  I  I decided to go back to Epic to speak with Joe in person. Its approx 10:20 when I get to Epic. The doorman calls for Joe over the radio. There was a lovely hostess (this time) that politely listened to the entire ordeal as I waited for about 10mins before walking out and going next door to NV Penthouse. DAN IS AMAZING!!!!  He really rolled out the red carpet. Personally walked me upstairs, went over different bottle options, even offered to have the table prest with brownies and chocolate covered strawberries AND when I mentioned that the tequila my best friend wanted wasn't on the list, he offered to pick up some personally.Needless to say we moved the party next door. After I set everything up I returned to Epic to see if the Joe hunt was successful. The doorman told me ""Oh you just missed him when you left out.  (FYI: The doorman was standing OUTSIDE of Epic and saw me speaking with the doorman at NV. Why he didn't find it neccesary to direct Joe to me or vice versa is beyong me.) I decided to sit down moreso just to get a drink from Jen, but decided to wait for Joe again. Needless to say I finished 2 ""7 Samuri""  and Joe never appeared.

Of course there was the required Saturday night line outside in order to make the place look busier than it really is, and of course there are the ""precious"" people who feel they are too important to wait in a line and pay the doormen to get in, which made our wait even longer.  Altogether, we waited about 15-20 minutes in line before we got in.

The bloomspot said reservation required, which we did not have, but they were very accommodating. Although the 2 ladies at the front desk were kind of disorganized on which table to seat us. Not a big deal.  It was a Monday night so we were happy to hear that all wine bottles for half half. We got a bottle of wine reasonably priced at $44 which at 50% off, isn't that bad at all.  Our waiter (didn't catch his name) was pretty helpful. I will have to say though that this place has a huge staff. As our waiter was explaining specials and overviewing the specials, he had a shadow of another employee and there were constantly busboys clearing our plates and taking out silverware. I would take a bite of my bread and next thing I knew, somebody would be there to take my plate. Not to mention the maitre'd just scouring the tables to check up on patrons. A little overwhelming. Also, our waiter was a little long winded. Going way too in depth on the different types of mussels, the salads, and entrees, blah blah blah. I swear he explained the menu and his recommendations for 5 minutes. Some people might like this? But it was too much man, take it easy.  We shared the Parmesan Gnocchi appetizer. This was not that great. Sadly, kind of bland and not memorable. The menu says lamb sausage, but I think I saw one small piece. The Fennel butter sauce, however, was the best part which I used my bread to sop up the sauce. Definitely not worth $14.  Chilean Sea Bass - I am a huge fan of Chilean Sea Bass. I think Epic really delivered on this dish. Portion was small for $32, but the fish was so light and buttery and perfectly cooked. The truffled crab bisque that it was laid on was unbelievable, and well paired with brussels sprouts and small potatoes. I enjoyed this dish a lot.  The Braised Short Ribs were also very good. I wanted to sea bass as well, but was told I couldn't order the same thing and we'd share. I reluctantly settled on the short ribs. I was pleasantly surprised. The short ribs were really really tender and the mushroom-farro risotto it sat on was really good. Very delicious sauce. Horseradish cream was pretty much hidden, but the entire dish was very good. Well done.  The wine was flowing and both plates were empty (I finished up both). We went to RPM down the street for dessert, because their tartuffo is simply amazing.  When it was time to check out, our waiter let us know that he wasn't able to give us the half off wine because we used the bloomspot. We didn't complain but I was kind of annoyed because the bloomspot was for $80 food & wine and I thought he should have told us this invalidates the half off wine. It's not like I had busted it out at the end of the meal, I told him as soon as we sat down. He said he didn't know that the special couldn't be used together with the coupon. Oh well, but that was the difference between 3 and 4 stars.  Our meal came out to be $131 (prior to discount) and although the meal was sufficiently good, it wasn't $131 good. For a restaurant to charge $42 for a steak and $32 for fish dishes plus $15 apps, you would think you'd leave with your mind blown and wanting more. I didn't get that but in the end, I will most likely be back for the bar and rooftop but probably not the pricey food.",0.9988,0.791,0.175,0.034,0.5446263227513226
2012-04-16,3.0,"I'm not sure how we picked Epic for my wife's birthday celebration.  We had 14 people going for dinner here and we were going to go up to the rooftop for after dinner drinks and partying, but we couldn't reserve a table on the rooftop unless we opted in for bottle service.  No drink packages were available either.   So we ended up just doing dinner at Epic.  All of the front of the house staff was amazingly friendly.  Amy, the person I dealt with in setting up this dinner was a pleasure to work with.  They even had ""Happy Birthday Nicole"" written on the top of our menus.  it was a simple touch, but it was an awesome thing for them to do! The menu itself was small, with about 7 (2 fish, no vegetarian) choices for the main course but then they also had 4 different cuts of steak on the menu as well.  they had a bunch of appetizer options but they were all priced for one person, maybe 2 and they were all at about $14 a plate.  yikes!  So we ordered the pork belly and calamari stuffed with braised short ribs.  they were both pretty good. For dinner, with 14 people, we ordered just about everything on the menu except for the roasted chicken.  Most people said that their food was really good, with the pork chop and salmon being the stand outs.  I had the braised short ribs and a buddy next to me had the braised lamb shank.  It was ok, but nothing mind blowing, but with the prices we paid, we were hoping for much better food.  the steaks were running at ~$42, more than what I remember it costing at a steakhouse like Morton's.  but the person that had it said it was good.  Sides are also separate, but the mac and cheese was the best thing here. for dessert I had the sticky toffee bread pudding, and it wasn't very tasty at all unfortunately.  TLDR version: Food was very pricey, and not quite as good as the prices would reflect.  front of the house staff was awesome!  very modern decor and a nice place to look at, but there are lots of stairs!  unfortunately, price and food quality for that price would probably keep me from coming back here again.",0.9966,0.791,0.172,0.036,0.5593930905695612
2012-04-12,3.0,"Making a go of a restaurant in Chicago is hard; living up to your namesake, Epic, is monumental.  Epic was selected for this chapter of the birthday lunch club. The word epic conjures up thoughts like big, bold, mind-blowing; unfortunately, after eating at Epic the thoughts I conjured up were okay, fine, decent. We arrived close to noon to an empty restaurant, we were surprised that few people trickled in during our time there; handy if you're looking for a nicer place you can walk right in at lunchtime. Seated on the ground floor, the high ceilings only made it feel more empty and devoid of ambiance; aside from the dark wood and long bar, I honestly can't tell you any more about the place. Epic offers two lunch menus - a full menu or a pared down prix fixe; none of us opted for prix fixe and I found the course choices rather scant. We started out with the tuna tartare, pork belly tacos and cheese plate for the table. Our server was kind enough to offer to add additional tacos, so we all could try it, but not enough of us were interested in the 'belly to take him up on his offer.  Not eating pork, I passed on the tacos but found the presentation odd. The amount of pork belly on each taco seemed generous, what was unusual was that it wasn't more thinly sliced. Each piece was approximately 1x1x2 inches, awkwardly sitting the middle of a flat tortilla; my co-workers ended up cutting theirs into daintier chunks which seemed to defeat the purpose of finger food. The tuna tartare was fine; it could have been my portion, but I found it bland and lacking any chile flavor the menu alluded to. The cheese plate, my favorite of the three, was comprised of manchego, goat cheese and bleu cheese - it was good and popular with all of us. I ordered the Asian Tuna Stack off the burger and sandwich section; I did not love my meal and found it odd, but fortunate to come with a side of hand cut fries. The menu descriptions leave a lot to be desired, focusing almost solely on ingredients rather than preparation; based on the description, I envisioned a rare or seared piece of tuna mixed with cucumber, daikon, wasabi aioli, crispy rice, and soy caramel.  What I received included all of the elements promised, but in the form of a circular slab of rice, approximately 1/2"" high, with a similar portion of tuna - cooked, not rare or seared - on top, with a slaw on top and the soy caramel drizzled all over. Next to the stack was an adorable mini fry basket of fries.  The stack was disappointing; the rice soaked up all of the sauce and any hints of wasabi making the whole dish bland. In my opinion they need to reduce the size of the rice patty because in addition to sucking up all the flavor, it's so filling - I barely finished half of the stack and barely made a dent in the fries. The fries were the shining star on the plate; their saltiness providing the flavor boost I was craving from the stack. The table also split the lobster mac and cheese entree; I say skip this dish. In addition to a very thin sauce, it was light on lobster and lacked the rich decadence I'd expect from a dish like this. When it came time for dessert, most of us were ready to pass - full and not overly impressed by our meals. Fortunately, one of my co-workers overruled us, ordering a cappuccino creme brulee and the chocolate hazelnut tart. The tart, served with chocolate ice cream bon bons was delicious and pretty much the only part of my meal that was close to being epic. Service was the one area Epic did not falter; attentive and friendly throughout our meal, we wanted for nothing. Someone was always attending to us - filling drinks, clearing plates, etc - all without feeling overbearing. Sending us off with flourless chocolate cookies was a nice parting touch. Unlike most of our birthday meals, this one lacked a symphony of rave reviews about the food.

The FOOD: My co-workers and I went for Chicago Chef's week.  I can't remember the exact menu, but I had the corn chowder (which had popcorn in it, and was delicious!!), the braised short ribs, and the dish that stole the show- the STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING.  Need I say more, really?  Every dish was great.  Good, rich, flavors - not too salty which was good.  The short ribs were tender and perfectly cooked.  From what I understand, the bread pudding is not always on the menu, so seriously, call ahead and find out what nights the chef plans to make it that week.  Even our server said she could not resist eating a bowl of the bread pudding each time the chef made it!  It won't disappoint, I'm telling you. The Atmosphere:  Good for dates, groups, friends, all of the above.  The decor is very pretty and the high ceilings make for a nice open feeling.  I would go back here with my boyfriend because I think he'll love it, and he's a picky restaurant person. The Service: Excellent.  It's apparent that they embody team work.  While our server was clearly in charge of attending to us, there was a group of gentlemen who refilled water, took plates, brought food, etc, and they were equally attentive and professional.  No one was pushy or annoying, but we felt well taken care of. Overall, this is one of my new favorite restaurants in Chicago.  I plan to go back for sure and look forward to trying other menu items.  I will be calling ahead to check the STICKY TOFFEE BREAD PUDDING schedule!

The ambience is definitely really nice, I love the big windows. We had a reservation for restaurant week, and we were seated at a table very close to the people next to us. I could pretty much hear everything the couples were saying next to us, even though it was pretty loud.  As soon as we sat down a waiter came over saying he would bring drink menus. About fifteen minutes later someone else came and asked if we wanted to order, but we had not even got the drink menus yet to order drinks. The service was definitely not stellar, but our waiter really was trying to accomadate us. I had the avocado cucumber drink, which was very interesting. I love cucumber cocktails, and the avocado puree was a good combo! For dinner we had the three course menu. First we both had the pear and endive salad, which was really good with the chorizo on it. We both had the salmon, which was pretty good, but didn't blow me away. It came with really good black grainy rice and broccolini which was really well cooked, and this was probably better than the fish for me. For dessert I had the peanut butter chocolate tart, which was like a chocolate mouse in a peanut butter cookie crust wtih a bit of caramel on the plate. It was pretty good, not amazing, and probably not worth eating the calories. My friend had the bread pudding that was great and had a delicious strong bourbon sauce on it. Another little issue was that they kept repeating the same indie playlist over and over. We heard the same Foster the People song about four times in one hour!

We went here for my birthday dinner one week ago, and honestly, I can barely remember what I ate.  The appetizers were very small and just odd, not necessarily unique and amazing, which is what it seems like they were going for.  I ordered a drink with avocado in it, what was good, but again, not amazing. My main course was steak, which was just ok and the sides of macaroni and brussel sprouts were all good enough, but nothing to bring me back again.   All in all, maybe a great place for large groups, but there are many restaurants in Chicago that I love and will go to again, this just isn't one of them.",0.9886,0.753,0.237,0.01,0.6022077922077922

2011-11-25,4.0,"Warning: Went here on Halloween (Monday) evening, so this experience may be slightly atypical... First of all, the space is tall, airy, modern and cool. There seems to be about three levels of dining space available with a bar on the first floor.  Went in around 7:30 for a business dinner with about eight colleagues. While we were there, only two other tables of diners were on the second floor where we were eating. At first it was unsettling, but once the food started coming, we stopped caring.  Below is a review of the food I ordered (or straight up stole from coworkers) Apps - Seared Diver Scallops w/shrimp, white beans and Spanish chorizo: well-prepared scallops, so they're delish. They aren't the best scallops I've had in the city, but they're definitely good.  Pork Belly: so darn good that, once I ate it, I wished I'd ordered three of those and skipped the main course. This sentiment changed after I ate... Mains & Sides - Braised Short Ribs: HOLY WOW. These were so good that I wanted to bathe in them. As a rule, I find mushrooms repellent in every way, but this dish made them delightful. These ribs are so magical that they make everything they touch delicious.  Pork Chop: This was the dish I'd heard lauded prior to going in... and it was definitely good (stole a forkful from my dining neighbor in exchange for a bite of short rib heaven), in fact, it was really good. BUT... in comparison to the culinary majesty of the short rib, it was just good. Mashed Potatoes: stellar. Frites: good stuff. Desserts -  Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup: one of my best friends in the world ordered this dish and loved it so much that she threatened not to share. She relented and we were all better off for it. If you're a fan of the chocolate/pb combo, you must get this. You'll not have a moment of regret (though you will have several moments of gym time to make up). Overall: I'd go back to Epic, though the next time I'll try to hit it later at night or later in the week.",0.9953,0.764,0.181,0.056,0.4046296296296296

I went here on a date this Friday and really enjoyed myself.  We had reservations for 9:45 which was perfect timing.  The bar downstairs is already bumping by 9:30 and only gets more packed throughout the night.  Although I didn't get to experience the bar too much because I was upstairs dining.  I'm glad they had an elevator because walking up those stairs in heels would not have been fun. We were seated right next to the window. The view is nice of the city.  I loved the atmosphere of the whole place. Low lighting with a grey, silver and black color scheme.  Almost an upscale industrial look.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  I ordered the brussel sprouts for an appetizer and the berkshire pork chop as my entree. Both absolutely amazing!  I love all the sauces and creams they put their food in.  They give big portions.  As they should, the prices are pretty steep! My date ordered chicken. Luckily they messed up the order and brought him the Chilean Sea Bass. OMG! The bass was soooo delicious. I wish I had ordered it!  The sauce they put in it was perfect. They brought us the chicken entree as well (no charge) and we dipped the chicken into the sea bass sauce. It was THAT good.  The chicken was in some kind of BBQ salsa. Good, but chicken is chicken.

2011-11-08,4.0,"I came here on a business dinner. I don't think I would've come here on my own because the menu is typical for American Contemporary food and I find that boring. I will say, though, I had a good experience. We had a party of 13. I ordered a cocktail that was made exactly to my specifications.  For appetizer I tried the candy cane roasted beet salad, scallops, and the cold seafood tower.  Beet salad was ok. I wasn't a fan of the grainy sugar sprinkled on, which were supposed to be candy canes, but I didn't taste mint. I should've gotten the arugula with prosciutto for my salad. Scallops were good. The white bean and chorizo that came with it was a pleasant surprise.  I had a few complaints about the cold seafood tower, but it's good if you have the craving.  The shells on the lobster and snow crab legs were flimsy rather than crisp, so breaking them was a pain. I believe that also means they weren't cooked fresh. More of the bivalves would've made the dish fuller. There was too much ice white space. I ordered the lamb shank for my entree with pumpkin puree, dark chocolate sauce, mint, and broccoli rabe. I could not taste any mint at all nor did I see any dates, but the dish was still superb. The meat was fall off the bone and tasty. The chocolate and pumpkin puree complemented the meat so well! It was a party in my mouth. Highly recommend. Dessert I tried the pumpkin creme caramel and toffee bread pudding. The creme caramel was too sugary. I didn't like it. The bread pudding was awesome. You could taste the bourbon in the sauce. I ordered an irish coffee and that was done very well.  The service was great. No complaints.

My husband and I went for dinner at 6 pm (so our experience isn't because the kitchen was slammed) and we've never had such a bad food experience. We ordered steaks (filet and ribeye) medium rare and they came to our table medium well. My husband mentioned it to the server and said we'd eat them anyway, but she insisted on taking them back to the kitchen.  This is where things went really bad - the kitchen then sent back steaks that were ice-cold and raw.  The fat on the outside of the ribeye was completely uncooked (just the hard white strip).  Besides being pretty gross, I have to imagine just serving the steaks was some kind of health code violation.  The waitstaff was pretty horrified when we waved them back over and immediately took them back to the kitchen.  At that point, we decided to cut our losses and ask for the bill since it was pretty obvious we weren't getting anything edible back from the kitchen.  When we were talking to the manager, they brought the steaks back a third time and they were burned crispy.  Needless to say, the manager was very apologetic and took care of our drinks and appetizer.   The waitstaff was great and handled everything with grace.  As for the kitchen, our experience indicates a complete lack of competence and professionalism.  They knew they sent out inedible raw meat the second time - We understood the message from the kitchen loud and clear.  Since we obviously weren't welcome to eat at Epic, we left and had a great dinner at Gibson's.   The Epic space is great, but I sincerely hope its management is addressing the kitchen issues.  There are too many great steak places in Chicago to bother with the headache (and possible toxoplasmosis) of dining at Epic.

The bus-ing was incredibly awkward in execution. We all enjoyed our dishes just fine but felt the prices were silly. The appetizers especially were an example of this - my tuna tartare was not flavorful, had chips that tasted like Baked Lay's (I know they weren't, but...), and was TINY. Meanwhile, it was $17. I have had tuna tartare appetizers at similarly nice restaurants here and there, and even the most stuffy places have had the sense to charge below $17, and for a larger portion at that.  The lobster/asparagus salad, which two family members ate, looked meager. The lobster was a stingy portion, and it was chopped up so much that it looked like tuna salad. Ick. My main course, whitefish, was fine - covered in extremely buttery sauce, it was hard to screw up. The ""crab fondue"" that sat on top of it was weirdly named - it was really just a creamy lump of mush. Oh, and my mom was gonna order a cup of gazpacho, but it was $10 for a freaking cup. So she made alternate plans, and wisely so. Look, I get that the ingredients are fancy-schmancy, and the location is great, but the portions were tiny for such insultingly high prices.

My company also pointed out that while their food was not bad for the price paid they were underwhelmed. The server seemed extremely entitled during our entire dinner; exchanged a total of ten words with us and was generally uninterested in our dining experience. My recommendation; if you're a Chicago local looking for a dinner before hitting the EPIC rooftop, enjoy an early dinner elsewhere in the Near North area and then enjoy the scenery of the roof late night. If you're an out-of-towner swayed by the sales pitch of a hot spot atmoshpere you can find better in the heart of downtown that features better service with all the pomp and circumstance.",0.9744,0.827,0.159,0.014,0.49807900432900437

We had a 5:30 reservation (we had a going away party later in the evening we had to get to) so we were one of the first to arrive! They sat us in a great table right by the window. From 5:30 -6:30 they serve a $42 3-course pre-fixe menu! I ordered off of that and had the Ahi Tuna to start, which was VERY fresh and light. For my entree I had the White Fish with Crab fondue and truffle oil and it was out of this world. First of all, you cant go wrong with Truffle Oil! Secondly, the fish was cooked to perfection and the crab on top was excellent. We shared the green beans and those were soooo good! I am not sure what they cooked/seasoned them with but OMG so tasty! For dessert, we split the peanut butter cup from the pre-fixe menu. It was super light and not too rich.  Our waiter was pretty good! He suggested a bottle of wine, which we both thought was delicious! There were several times when our wine glasses were left empty due to the fact that he kept the bottled chilled elsewhere, but all in all he did a great job! We also ordered this delicious summer cocktail they have on their menu and it was very light and refreshing!  I would definitely come back here again.

The views are not as great as I had expected, though the small groups of couches and chairs were comfortable. The drinks are pricey, but are scrumptious and incredibly strong. The main reason I wouldn't return here was the horrible service. Our waitress admitted that she was new, but I figure the first training session of being a waitress would be 'don't be a huge bitch to your customers.' Apparently she didn't learn. We asked to have separate checks, which she happily did, but gave us our checks with our first round of drinks. When we mentioned we planned on separate checks, but not yet, she rolled her eyes and walked away. She also never returned to our table the entire time we stayed, but went to all the other customers multiple times. We decided to leave, so my friend brought all of our checks to the bar. Our waitress finally returned to our table to bring our cards back, literally throwing the bills down and about facing us. No good evening, no thank you, nothing.

As a starter we decided to try the Ahi Tuna Tartare, which was perfect in taste.  Again another great pick for a summer lunch.  Then a cobb salad which was good like any other cobb salad should be.  My friend ordered the Grilled skirt steak sandwich and I ordered the Maine Lobster Roll.  We both liked ours except for the bread which was drenched in butter.  My fingers were extremely greasy and my mouth felt like I drank oil after the first bite.  We just ended up leaving the bread aside.  I didn't care so much for the fries either.   We loved the dessert though!

Let's talk about lunch first - went there with a client along with a couple of other co-workers and was a little unsettled by the fact that we were seated in the front at the high top tables.  Not sure what their thinking is to have lunchtime diners sit downstairs and dinner diners to sit at the very nicely decorated upstairs, but went with it and thought it had to do with the fact that it wasn't very crowded during lunch.  The food was above average lunchtime fare and the service was pleasant so I wanted to try it again for dinner. Now the dinner - went with my husband and we were seated in the nicely decorated upstairs at a two-top.  Our very-nice-waiter was very attentive and took our drink order and dinner order promptly.  Our food came at appropriate intervals and everything was great. The problem came with the people seated on either side of us.  I noticed right away that the two-tops were very close to each other, and this proved to be highly distracting throughout the entire dinner.  The couple on one side of us couldn't stop touching each other through the whole meal and decided that there was too much space in between them so they actually moved the two top lengthwise so they could be closer to each other. The people on the other side of our table were two girl friends.  They were already seated when we got there and they ordered before we ordered.  However, our food got to our table before them and we ordered the same exact thing.  They definitely noticed and started whispering to each other.  We definitely noticed that they were looking at our food and whispering, and that was awkward to say the least.  They talked to their waiter about how long their food was taking, and he tried to rectify it by ordering something else for them ""on the house"" to smooth things over while their food was being prepared.  But it wasn't clear that the ""on the house"" food was ""on the house"" so the runner put it in front of them, and they said it wasn't their food so the runner took it away, but then the waiter came back to let the know that it was ""on the house"" and the runner came back with the food.

I was PLEASANTLY PLEASED with my entree selection as all of the flavors surprisingly blended well together......I guess that's why the chef cooks and I eat and not the other way around, LOL.  Although the meats were juicy and flavorful my only complaint is that the entrees are ala carte and this is always a downfall in my opinion. Also, it's a little overpriced not to be accompanied with a vegetable of some kind. A $28 pork chop is a bit much but it's a nice place for a special occasion. Although I was full after my meal this is not the type of restaurant that you will have a ton of leftovers from after you dine.

Went last Friday night and it was packed.  It took a while to get a drink, but what do you expect when there's 200 people packed into one space?  I don't mind waiting, but I hate hooches that think they can squeeze ahead because their tits are hanging out.  But the bartender, the only person of color in a sea of white, was cool and told them they had to wait because we were there first. Other than that, the rest of the night sucked.  One of the managers was behind the bar, but was too busy oogling over the blond bartender that all he did was get in the way and slow her down.  When you're this packed, don't you think you should be trying to facilitate or ummm... manage the place a little better?! Hmmm Mr Manager? Luckily since it was just me and my gfs we didn't have to pay the $20 cover the door guys were charging.  Yep, $20 guys.  Each. Lastly a little while back I was there having a drink with a friend and happened to be sitting near the owner & some of his friends.  What a d-bag!  From what we overheard he's just another spoiled kid living off his family's money.  And the way he talked to the staff as if they were there to spoon feed him and his friends was disgusting.  These people are your employees, not your servants you dickhead.  Why would you ever wanna give your money to this guy?",0.8965,0.802,0.115,0.083,0.4424897119341565

I politely reminded me just to take it off the bill b/c I didn't think I would have time to finish it. He was sincerely apologetic and insisted on bringing the glass of wine on the house.  I appreciated that b/c it's kinda rare to see that now.

If it was in a small restaurant venue, minus the whole fancy 3 floor plus rooftop bar, Downtown Chicago extravaganza, and the prices were 30% cheaper, you'd have a winning deal. But I'm not much for this upscale ""I like to lounge around and drink $16 cocktails"" atmosphere, so for me it was just A-OK. I love the roasted beet salad. I know this sounds lame, because foodies will go ""who the hell reviews a salad?"" But seriously, the beet salad for me was magnificent. It was like a revelation you could only get while laying face up in the barn of Schrute farms chewing psychobilin mushrooms. They used different types of beats even, like a selection you would see at a hipster frequented farmer's market. Then add some panchetta, some smooth goat cheese, some leafy stuff and toasted pistachios. I was happy. Salmon? Good. Lamb? Good. Caramelized brussel sprouts with honey and garlic? Excellent way to throw an additional $10 onto your main course. Delicious. My friends became obsessed and began ordering the wine tasting menu, ahi tuna from the raw menu, it started getting nuts. Pretty soon we were cashing out our bills at $80 to $150 each person. It was getting absurd, but I personally could not get over the very first thing I tasted, which was that juicy slice of beet in my mouth. I wanna go back and taste it again.

Now to the important things, food. The apps we had were amazing, the Parmesan Gnoochi was fantastic, I was really blown away. The gnoochi were light and fluffy but had a little crunch to it. I could easily eat the gnoochi for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Then the Duck Breast Prosciutto, although not what I thought it was gonna be (prosciutto wrapped duck) but it was delicious. The duck breast was dry-cured the way prosciutto is and was paired with honey and persimmon which was a great contrast to the saltiness of the meat.  Of the 3 main courses I tasted the Seared Sea Scallops were the best. When the plate arrived I got a big whiff of truffle.The scallops were cooked perfectly and the taste of the truffles lingered on my tasted buds. Next best dish was the Sea Bass with kale. The fish was cooked well and brought out a sweetness in the kale, which I've never tasted before in kale. The Magret Duck Breast was my least favorite dish, the meat was over done and had dried out. That being said the flavor was still there.  As far as sides go, the Caramelized Brussels Sprouts were amazing. Best brussels sprouts I've had. The saltiness of the pancetta went very nicely with the sprouts. On the other hand, we have the Lobster Mashed Potatoes which sounded mouthwatering but was a great disappointment. They were pretty much your standard mash potatoes.   This brings me to dessert. Hands down the best dessert was the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, I was very close to having to change my underwear after having a bite. The creaminess of the mousse and crunch of the chocolate were a great contrast to each other. The dessert reminded me of a giant reese's pieces. The Whiskey Apple Walnut Crunch fell a bit short. It was like a deconstructed apple cobbler but didn't really work. The apple was a little cooked for my taste and I wasn't getting much of the whiskey flavor that I expected. The best part of the dish was the black current gastrique.  Stick to the above suggestions and you will have an excellent meal.",0.9986,0.744,0.236,0.019,0.5446581196581197

I arrived with my girlfriend for a friend's birthday for drinks at 10 PM after a phenomenal dinner at Zocalo. The decor and layout looked nice to me. There were 3 goons in suits blocking the entrance. They were talking to each other and mumbled to us to go right in. The entrance was so blocked I thought they were talking to some VIP in a suit. No, they were talking amongst themselves and I was granted admission without an ID check, albeit had to walk around the group to get inside.  Bartender serves an expensive but well-poured set of drinks pretty generous on alcohol. I learn that the coat check is complimentary (sounds nice) so I take our coats over there immediately. There again is a 3-member staff there, collecting coats, but there are so many people lined up in confusion and the staff doesn't talk. They just look at you like you're on an awkward first date expecting you to know the routine there.

This is a small corridor and he invades my space, kind of looks at me closely and says ""Hi."" He comes a step closer to me and I back into the corner out of defense, the guy gives me a look up and down as if he is interested in me.

The food was what you would expect from a higher-end restaurant, as far as portion sizes and selection.  That said, all of the food we shared was very good. -- Tuna tartare had just the right texture and was served with parmesan chips.  It was not enough for 4 to share, but would be great for 2 to start out with. -- Butternut squash ravioli - the pasta was a firm, the filling was really full of flavor, and the light sauce was not really a compliment to the dish. -- Rib-eye was a large portion, with the typical steakhouse ordering method (doneness, large list of sauces, and accessories).  We chose the mushroom sauce, and the steak was really really good. -- Peanut Butter Cup dessert - as per the Yelp recommendations, we had to try this.  It was actually a bit smaller than I had thought (and hoped!), and the peanut butter was certainly the star. Otherwise, the experience was ""fine"".  Hand delivered bread was certainly a step above the bread bucket at the table, except each person got 1/2 a piece, and that was all. I think Epic is more of a place to go for the downstairs bar (I can't say anything about Epic Sky since it is winter), as the place was packed when we finished dinner.

The bread service was a bit strange: they brought individual pieces of bread using tongs to deliver them right to our bread plates.  However, they only brought one piece for each person and then collected the plates, butter, etc as soon as the appetizer arrived--just after most of us finished our first piece.

There was our very ""own"" bar, and a nearly constant flow of appetizers carried about by the waitstaff. I casually mentioned to one of the waiters that I did not eat seafood, and it seems that he then informed the other servers that this particular bloke did not want any seafood apps so they were aware of my ""weakness"". Unfortunately (for me) most of them did contain seafood, so actually the crowd was very happy.

Service was helpful and prompt.  Now to the food.... The bread that came out was literally hard as a rock.  It was painful to eat.  Not sure if it was old, or if it was just very overcooked.  Probably the worst way they could have started a meal.   Had the Hamachi and Veal Sweetbreads as appetizers.  The Hamachi was cut relatively thick and was just uninspiring.  The pieces of the Veal Sweetbreads were very large - so large that they really made you realize you were eating sweetbreads when you bit into them.  They were covered in a very thick layer of fried batter, so the dominant flavor was fried batter.  The worst sweetbreads I've had. For dinner was the Scallops and a Filet.  The scallops were cold when they came out and slightly raw in the middle.  Almost as if they had tried to sear a frozen scallop.  The (medium-rare) Filet had a burnt crust on it 1/4 thick all around and was overcooked.   Chocolate peanut butter cup for dessert was just dull.

After last night's experience, we'll never go back.....onto the review: It was my girlfriend's birthday and I wanted to bring her out to a special dinner. The last time we came to Epic, it was a bit stuffy, but the food was excellent. We decided to go back.  We had 8:00 reservations on a Tuesday night. We walked in 10 minutes early and the hostess asked us if we'd like to get a drink first. We walked over to the bar, sat down and waited......and waited...it took the bartender about 10 minutes to get to us, which I can understand since there was ONLY 2 other people sitting at the bar. We finally got our drinks just as the hostess asks us if we're ready to be seated.  The hostess was extremely friendly as she showed us to our seats. It was pretty obvious we were on a date. She seats us next to 4 douche-rags in suits. Now, the place wasn't packed, there were PLENTY of open seats. Instead, we're seated next to 4 guys who apparently have never seen a woman before, and decided to ""covertly"" stare at my girlfriend. Did I mention that our tables were about 6 inches apart? It was so uncomfortable that my date asked ""do you want to leave?"" I said ""no, it's your birthday, you want to eat here, we'll make the best of it"".  For 15 minutes, I watched as waiters come up to the table next to us about 5 times, at least 3 guys (managers?) with ear pieces walked around tending tables, and busboys filled glasses all around. Nobody shows to our table, nothing. Our waiter FINALLY comes to our table. I joke and say ""heh, I thought you forgot about us"". He doesn't even acknowledge it, asks us about water, and my date orders a drink. He darts off before we can even order an appetizer.  We get our water and drink. A few minutes later four ladies sit next to us on the other side. (Thank god, maybe these guys can stare these girls into submission.) These girls don't sit down for 5 minutes before I hear the waiter come up to their table, ask them for drinks and read off the specials.  It's been a half hour at this point, all we have to show for it is 2 glasses of water and a Vodka/Soda. I had enough, turned to my date and said ""Let's go!"" We got up and left. We get downstairs and I say to the Hostesses ""please get my car, and we're not paying for it"". They immediately got my car.  In all fairness, the main hostess did try to resolve the situation. As we were getting into the car, she came out and said ""The manager will come out soon, he can get you a round, or something to make it better"". At this point, there was nothing we wanted from that place. sidenote: I could see the manager hiding behind the front door (made of glass) afraid to come out.  We left and went to Cibo Matto at Hotel Wit for an excellent  dinner.  Thanks for making it a memorial birthday dinner, Epic.

2010-10-18,1.0,"*BAR REVIEW* - Since I have not eaten at the restaurant, this review is for their bar only. Last Thursday we went to different restaurant for Dinner and decided to meet some friends at Epic for a few drinks. When we arrived, our friends already warned us that they are already experiencing bad service and they don't know what is going on. They mentioned that they ordered drinks with the waitress, but after the drinks didn't arrive for 20 minutes, they noticed that the drinks were actually standing at the bar, waiting to be picked up. After five additional minutes my friends walked up to the bar and picked up the drinks themselves. When we joined the table, the waitress was there pretty fast and she was friendly. She mentioned that she's a little busy and that she has the whole room for herself. We ordered another round of drinks and while they took longer than normal, we understood the situation (it took about 15-20 minutes to get everything). Interestingly the table next to us consisted of four guys and the bouncer walked up to them and told them that they have to give up their table and they will get a round of shots for it. They then moved the table to a different party. When it came to ordering the next round of drinks, we noticed that there was now a second waitress on the floor, but she ignored us and would not take our orders.  We had to wait until our original waitress came back, who was now on the total opposite side of the restaurant. Needless to say that it took forever to get something ordered and after a few rounds we decided to leave and go somewhere else. This is where the real drama started. We tried to find to get the check, but only the other waitress was there. When we called her, she ignored our table again and wouldn't even come up. So we went over to her and asked if we can get the check, since we're not able to locate our original waitress for quite some time. She said that we're not one of her tables and she wouldn't do anything for us. So we waited another 20 minutes and since we couldn't locate the first waitress, we went back to the other one and pleaded if she could please bring us the bill. With a very upset face she delivered the check to the table, but never came back to pick it up. Since many other tables left and the bar cleared out, the waitress wasn't too busy and was chatting and giggling at the bar with other staff members. We walked up to her and asked if she can run the card, she yelled at our face saying that we can't just interrupt her and if we don't see that she's busy right now plus that we are not supposed to approach the service area at the bar.  While I have no problem paying higher prices (our check was $200 for three rounds of drinks), I think I can expect reasonable service and not have the wait staff yell at us. Again, this review is for their bar only, but after experiencing this type of service at the bar, we have no interest in trying out their restaurant.",0.9691,0.885,0.075,0.041,0.42348710317460325

All was cooked perfectly and everyone was happy. Incredible tasting bernaise sauce and the dipping sauce for the frites were very memorable. This place is a bit on the pricey side when it comes to the wine list. Cocktails are not the cheapest in chicago either, but i would go back for all reasons mentioned earlier. We hit the rooftop afterwards but it proved a little too full of Chachi's and Affliction shirts for us to stick around. I had heard that the roof was cooler than it was....it's not that large and the view is lacking. If you are looking for a rooftop cocktail party, there are many others in chicago with superior views.

2010-10-07,3.0,"Tonight, I had the chance to dine at Epic with a client.  The space is epic, with interesting design twists everywhere.  Someone spent some time and money creating a place that looks great, and raises expectations about the food and experience.  However, one need only look at the two flat-screen TV's strangely present at either end of the bar to know that there is a bit of an identity crisis at play.  Is this a fine-dining food locale, or a sports bar?  Is it meant to be high-design or local bar flavor?  Well, Epic, which is it?  I know which side of that debate I would favor, but you'll have to figure it out for yourself.   The food was fine...meaning ok...not 'fine dining'.  Actually, I was struck by the amount of salt present in both my amuse bouche and my peppercorn-crusted grilled hanger steak.  Remember, Epic, a diner can always add salt, but they can't take it away.  (Note the irony of a peppercorn-crusted steak being too salty.) The service was attentive and friendly, but there was this strange mix of formality and over-familiarity.  Again, raising the question about identity.   Who are you, Epic?  Perhaps you are a Gemini.",0.9034,0.835,0.115,0.051,0.3823529411764707

Sadly, we were sorely dissapointed with Epic. I went with 6 ladies and 3 guys. They let the ladies skip the line but said the guys would have to pay $30 each. The bouncers were complete assholes about it too (great way to make a welcome impression). We get in and have yet another line to wait in - to get into the elevator to go to the rooftop. It was crowded so the ladies went up first. When we got up, we realized the guys were nowhere to be found. They texted us that the bouncers determined the rooftop was now ""full"" and they guys would have to pay $20 each to get up to the roof. F-ing ridiculous. Sadly, the ""roof"" itself wasn't much of a roof - it's on the 6th floor with NO view and the music was softly playing in the background-did NOT feel like a happening time. The crowd was all over 40 crowd and looked bored. It's insane for the guys to pay $50 to gain access to a crappy outdoor area so we went back down to the bar.

WHAT?! in conclusion - definitely not coming back here for drinks, there are FAR better places, especially in this area.",-0.7262,0.834,0.066,0.1,0.5414565826330531
2010-09-19,3.0,"My friend asked me to help plan her 26th birthday and I was trying hard to think of a good place to have it. I had been to Epic on a Thursday night a few months back for a friends work event and had a great time. I was a little concerned though after reading most of the other Yelp reviews but I figured as long as we got there really early it would be okay. I rushed everyone to Epic and we got there by 9:45 (it was a Saturday). There was actually no line, despite what I had read. They tried to charge us for $20 for each guy but the birthday girl bargained them down to $10 a guy.  We walked in and first floor had a fair amount of tables dining but was  still relatively open. The last time I went to Epic I had been to the rooftop and figured I'd try to get us up there again. We all hopped in the elevator and headed to the third floor.  On the roof there were about 2 other booths with people but was pretty empty. We grabbed a big booth in the corner. We ended up having a great time. The bartender was pretty lacking and drinks aren't cheap but the view of the other buildings at night is great and we were all able to sit and talk and there were about 12 of us.  At midnight, the roof closed and we headed to the first floor. It was pretty packed but they were playing top 40 at that point. We  stayed for a little while but decided it was time to dance and headed to the Underground around the corner. Bottom line, getting to Epic on a Saturday before 10 is key to not wait in line and have a good time.",0.9918,0.831,0.15,0.019,0.475997150997151

2010-09-16,2.0,"Epic?  More like epic fail. We started with drinks on the rooftop, which is very nice (although the bar stools are the most uncomfortable things ever).  The drinks are a bit pricey, but it's a rooftop bar downtown and it's to be expected. The restaurant is a hot mess. The place is too big, has too much of a tourista feel, and has a way overpriced wine list.  I felt like I was at the ""fancy"" restaurant at Disney World.  Also, note to people with kids: you do NOT need to bring the stroller, the car carrier, the Baby Bjorn and 27 pounds of other shit to a restaurant.  Particularly when it's after 8:30.  Get a sitter, yo. Anyway, most of the food was fine (not great), but my lamb dish was awful.  It was bland as could be.  Gwen P. ordered the exact same thing, and it was like eating a completely different dish!  We all concluded that my dish was not seasoned AT ALL.  We told our server (who was NOT nice at all) that the two lamb plates tasted completely different.  This prompted a table visit from the manager (which is always mortifying in itself). Despite us saying we didn't want dessert, the manager sent over a complimentary apple something-or-other with some muscato for the group.  This is one of my pet peeves.  I didn't like my dinner, no big deal, really, I swear.  I'll live.  We JUST said we didn't want dessert, we just want to get the eff out of there and go get our drink on.  I don't want to feel obligated to eat something I didn't ask for (and, in fact, specifically declined).  The complimentary glasses of muscato were a nice gesture, but not enough to salvage the overall dining experience. I wouldn't go back (despite the free booze and them comping my entree).  There are plenty of other places that are either more reasonably priced, have better food, or both.  The rooftop bar is quite nice for pre-dinner drinks though!",0.9773,0.803,0.125,0.071,0.5077235772357723
2010-09-15,2.0,"EPIC was the September selection for our Supper Club. I'm slightly pissed at myself since I think I originally added it to our ""must try"" list so I feel slightly responsible. We met at 8pm on Saturday on the roof bar to have drinks before dinner. The rooftop reminded me of every hotel bar in San Diego...that's a good thing. The drinks were tasty ($11-15 range) but everything was tasty. It was a before dinner crowd so it wasn't too busy, and some girls in our party knew the bartender, so we got lots of attention. Unfortunately, the drinks were the highlight of the nights. When we were seated, we got a great table in the middle of the dining room, and I think we were all a little disappointed by the scene. I think EPIC has been working the hotel circuit hard...the crowd was touristy and downright odd. I mean, there was a couple with baby and a stroller at  the table next to us...Denny's style. Very odd. Our server was slow, our glasses ran empty, the food was inconsistent...I had the same dish as the ""foodie"" in our group, and while mine was good, hers was BLAND. We all tasted both and the consensus was that her protein was not seasoned. at. all. I do have to give props that the gnocchi starter and the steak entree are both very good. The gnocchi was delish, and our friend that had a filet said it was perfectly cooked and had that great, crispy, flavory sear. To make up for her bad lamb, the manager brought out an equally bad dessert (it tasted like the hardened sugar of a creme brulee, without the creme brulee) and apples. The muscat we had with dessert is just not my favorite...I'm not into sweet wines. They did give the drinks/dessert and my friend's lamb on the house, which is good, but the rest of the experience was so janky that by the time the bill came we just wanted to get the hell out of there. Skip EPIC, but go for drinks on the roof deck. My guess is it won't make it to next summer.",0.899,0.797,0.114,0.089,0.5048655913978495
2010-09-15,4.0,"It was my girlfriend's birthday and I was searching for a unique, cool, and delicious restaurant to try. She isn't a fan of seafood, so I tried to find a nicer place that we had not tried that had a varied menu. My choices boiled down to either Girl and the Goat or Epic. Unfortunately, Girl and the Goat didn't have any good times open on her birthday. So I decided to take a chance on Epic. It turned out to be great.  The decor is beautiful. The exposed brick combined with the low lighting and dark tones of the furniture cultivate an air of sophistication without feeling too snooty or uncomfortable.  Our server was very friendly and was very knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu. In making our choices, he offered some recommendations along with explanations on why he liked each dish. This not only was helpful but helped us feel like we were having a gourmet experience.  I ordered the Halibut and my girlfriend ordered a Filet. Both were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. We also shared the Yukon puree, which sounds plain but is actually delicious! Presentation was also on par.  We decided to pass on dessert. However, the restaurant knew it was my girlfriend's birthday, so they brought us complimentary champange and a piece of french-style cheesecake. Delicious and very thoughtful!  You may be wondering, though, why it only gets 4 out of 5 stars. They lost a star for something I've read about in other reviews: slow service. Albeit, they treated us really well, our server did seem to spend a decent amount of time *away* from our table. This was minor, though, because we were enjoying ourselves.  Overall, this was a great dining experience. My girlfriend loved it and it helped us enjoy her birthday. Definitely date appropriate and could be a good place for a nice, group dinner.

For birthdays or other major events, we celebrate at a nice steak place so for my recent birthday, this definitely jumped to the front of the list. Plus, it was pricey...and I wasn't paying for it :) After a friend had a bad experience at the bar on the roof, I was nervous to go, but I have to say, I had a really nice meal here.  I spent half of the time letting my eyes wander, down to the street out of the floor to ceiling windows and to the expansive seating area throughout the restaurant. It's amazing how large it was inside and how spacious it felt.  For food, we got six oysters (which had absolutely delicious sauces) and gnocchi with lamb sausage and spinach. The gnocchi was really tasty, light and delicious without feeling super heavy, like a weight in your stomach. Dad, who hates any non-traditional foods (which this falls into) really enjoyed it too. For main dishes, I got the Sirloin and the peppercorn dipping sauce while dad got the seven spiced skirt steak. I was VERY happy with my dish. There was little fat and the 16oz portion left a lot for leftovers. Dad really enjoyed the skirt steak too, which had a great flavor and was cooked perfectly in the interior. For sides, we got the fries (which was his choice) and again, they tasted gourmet and had great sauces to go with it.

2010-08-20,4.0,"I am a lazy girl.  No really, I'm all about the shortcuts - and so anything multipurpose automatically wins points with me. Well, anything that succeeds at accomplishing many objectives simultaneously, that is. So I'm not such a fan of 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner. However, a 2-in-1 lounge/restaurant that allows for a posh, seductive yet busy atmosphere for fancy drinks and appetizers with the girls and for a lusciously rich meal in a ritzy urban space with old friends is definitely on my go-to list of places to recommend to friends visiting town. Why? Trip 1: a cold winter night in January. Epic had just opened. Four girlfriends and I decided to begin a GNO here in the lounge (no dinner). So drinks galore - from salty chihuahuas to sex panthers, we really enjoyed the martinis, and the appetizers we tried were well-balanced, well-portioned and well-presented. Tuna tartare was in particular a favorite of mine; the potato gaufrette was a nice salty contrast to the acid of the citrus in the tartare. It was the perfect introduction to the concept of the restaurant, and enticed me to return for dinner, which I did... Trip 2: a warm summer night in August. 7 months later, I skipped back with two old co-workers/friends - more the latter than the former - for dinner to celebrate. We began with an amuse bouche of parmesan and foie as the base notes in a ravioli. In addition to a bottle of the prosecco, this was a great precursor to the meal. For appetizers, we had the gnocchi, which was made with house-made lamb sausage, swiss chard, fennel beurre blanc. The gnocchi melted like heaven in your mouth and the beurre blanc was spot on, but the sausage had a rougher texture. I still loved the flavors of the dish. The halibut ceviche came in 5 shells, each with a bit of avocado mousse, a distinctly rich ending to each bite of fish. True confession: I ate less of the gnocchi so it would be less of a faux pas for me to take 3 shells. For the main course, I had the seven pepper crusted hanger steak. I love my pepper, but it wasn't as if this steak were peppercorn-crusted at a chain steakhouse. The flavors were subtle, enhancing rather than masking the essence of the juicy meat. Between the options of bordelaise, chasseur, peppercorn, horseradish, béarnaise, and bleu cheese for accompanying sauce, we chose a chasseur, which the waiter said was done with bacon as the meat base there. I had the privilege of trying my friend's spiced lamb shank with preserved lemon and jus. The spices were amazingly prominent and the lamb was literally falling off the bone, it was so tender. We also each had martinis with our meals - sex panthers, and some gin based ones, all of which were met with smiles. Afterwards, we checked out the rooftop deck on the 3rd floor, which was as swank as some I've been to in DC/NYC - except Epic had better views.  The only slightly sour note was where my friend was charged the full cost of the entire dinner on her card (in addition to the amounts charged on our cards) and the waiter said it was a mistake and that it didn't really go through. Receipts are printed for a reason, sir. Anyways, she checked with her bank for the next few days and sure enough, the full amount had been charged to her. Not the sweetest ending to a meal. I'll return though - the food and ambience are some of the best in the city. In fact, I'm going back tomorrow...",0.9965,0.844,0.131,0.025,0.46565170940170947

2010-08-14,1.0,"So my friends and I wanted to check this place out last night for some pre-dinner drinks at the rooftop. I'm usually a fan of large restaurants and I had high hopes especially for a place called Epic.  We make it up to the rooftop, everything is nice and dandy, get a few drinks and sit down at an empty table. Then the floor manager comes over and asks if she could move the empty table next to us (as an extension for a larger party), except then she decides to ask me to move it for her- halfway across the rooftop.  EXCUSE ME?!?!?! I'm coming here to enjoy a few drinks and then expected to move things for you? Of course I politely if she had anyone that could help her with that (a fellow waiter/busboy?). Then she gives a snide, ""Thanks for your help!"" and takes the table.  Then she comes back and tells us the table that we were sitting on was reserved and asks me for the time (of course it wasn't, but she didn't push it any further).  I'm just flabbergasted at the service here. Especially at a time when restaurants are closing left and right, you would think food and service would be more vital than ever.  This particular floor manager definitely needs to take a restaurant service 101 class, perhaps from Naha's reservationist who I found to be one of the most courteous and professional that I have ever talked to.  I could go on, but I think I'll stop there.

2010-08-13,4.0,"Went to Epic last night and I was throughly impressed. I was lucky enough to get to go as part of a business dinner - aka I wasn't paying.  Perhaps I would have been a bit more critical if it was my own moolah, but I most likely would not have gone at all since it's pretty pricey. We started out with drinks at the bar downstairs. The space is gorgeous - simple but dramatic at the same time. Apparently the building was originally 6 stories but they gutted it and made it three for the restaurant. So prepare for verrry high ceilings! Service was outstanding from the get go. Friendly, unpretentious, and helpful. I always appreciate when the server's recommendations are not the most expensive items on the menu. That's classy, yo!  We had the tuna tartare, gnocchi, and hamachi as appetizers. All were delish with the gnocchi being the most memorable. For dinner, everyone in our group ordered either the veal or the halibut (two recos from the server) and everyone but me cleaned their plate because I spent too much time filling up on all the delicious SIDES! OMG, the ""penne gratin"" - their fancy pants way of saying macaroni and cheese - was so freaking good. Crumbly bits on top and perfect consistency throughout. We also had the fries and the spinach - had to balance out all the carbs with some green on the table! The already amazing meal ended with the blueberry cheesecake and cinnamon sugar donuts. I wish I'd been able to enjoy those more but I'd already put the button on my pants through enough for 1 evening. We went up to the roof for a couple drinks after and it is lovely but very sceney. Not really my taste per se, but I can definitely appreciate a great view and awesome weather.  Apparently they charge an astronomical fee to reserve a table - something like $750??? All in all definitely worth checking out. This particular strip doesn't have many ""fine dining"" restaurants on it so this takes the cake in that regard. It's not cheap but makes for a fun night out for a group or something a bit more romantical for a date!",0.9986,0.739,0.241,0.02,0.580499533146592

Now, I don't mind waiting in line to get into a great bar if it's worth it and I heard Epic was worth the wait. So I waited...and waited.... The first thing that pissed me off (other than the wait) was the fact that if you were a friend of the bouncers you were automatically let in. No wait. No line. Just go up, kiss them on the cheek, and go in. Boom...done. But if you are not friends with the bouncers, prepare to wait.  30 mins later we are inside. We show our ID's, walk in and head over to the elevator which takes you up to the rooftop which was the WHOLE REASON WE WENT. Well guess what...it was at capacity!  Now, if you are known for having a great rooftop and it's a wonderful warm Chicago night you would have to assume 90% of the people waiting in line want to get onto the rooftop. So if it is at capacity let everyone in line know in advance so they can decide if they want to continue waiting or if they want to move on with the rest of their night.

The food was excellent, I had filet, and loved it even though I am not a huge steak eater.  I especially like that you can choose from a variety of sauces for your steak. I have also been to the rooftop.  I thought that the decor on the roof and overall atmosphere were great.  I just got a beer but two friends asked for basic mojitos and they were so terrible that they had to return them at the bar.  So I would recommend the rooftop as a place to hang out and have a beer, but not a place to get your favorite cocktail.",0.9684,0.784,0.162,0.053,0.69625
2010-08-07,4.0,"This was one of the best dinners I have had in a long time! Really, really enjoyed it. First off, I have to say that I have been wanting to go here for quite some time... and my bf surprised me with a fun date night out. The only real reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was way too trendy for me. It is the place to be after 10 pm on a weekend... due to the gorgeous Epic Sky. Expect to see many a dressed up ladies in their short dresses and high heels, and groups of well-dressed men lookin' to meet someone.  But let me get into what I loved about the place. First of all, the space is INCREDIBLE! High ceilings, open atmosphere, and modern decor. Really, really impressive. There are 3 floors to this place and it is just huge. I enjoyed a tasty pear cocktail at the bar before our table was ready. Then, we went up the stairs for our dinner. The meal started with a complimentary amuse bouche - a boar fried dumpling of some sorts. It was tasty, but nothing to write home about. And then they brought out some tasty rolls, crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. The only thing I was disappointed about was that the butter (which was creamy and soft) was not salted at all. My suggestion would be to do some herb butter with some salt... that would be amazing! We started out with some fresh oysters... DELICIOUS! But really, it is hard to go wrong with oysters at a nice restaurant. I loved that they came with a trio of sauces - a creamy dijonnaise, cocktail, and a meyer lemon creme. I was surprised that they didn't have horseradish, though, and that would have been a nice extra. For my entree I ordered the scallops. There were 3 good-sized scallops, seared to perfection, with a little garnish of mixed greens and sitting in a creme sauce. So good! My bf got the halibut that was pan fried to perfection and had the nice crisp skin on top. It came on top of a fresh corn salsa. Great quality!! For the sides we ordered the asparagus (just ok... nothing special except it did come with pecorino on top, which was yummy) and the french fries. I LOVED the fries.. mostly because of the dipping sauce it came with. It was a smoky paprika garlic aioli... it tasted like bacon to me. But I could have dipped everything in the sauce or even just eaten it in spoonfuls! The french fries were the hand-cut ones, fried just right. I was impressed... and it takes a lot for me to be impressed with fries. For dessert, we just wanted something sweet and clean so we got a scoop of the mango sorbet. It was the smallest scoop of sorbet I have ever seen... but it was quite tasty. Overall, it was a fantastic meal! We enjoyed every bite with a delicious bottle of Frog's Leap Sauvignion Blanc.  The service was pretty good... not extraordinary but not bad at all. It is a little on the pricier side, but I definitely think it was worth it for a nice night out.  After we finished our meal, we had to check out the Epic Sky lounge on the roof. Man, was this the place to be! If I were younger and single, it would be a place to see and be seen. We even ran into Dusty Baker up there and (most likely) some of the Cincinnati Reds players. It was a gorgeous night and a great view. When we left there was a line out the door to get up to Epic Sky, which totally confirmed that this place was way too trendy for us. I would definitely go back for dinner or a cocktail up at Epic Sky on a weeknight.",0.9994,0.758,0.224,0.018,0.5906527554842161
2010-08-02,2.0,"I started to write this on Sat. night just after returning home from Epic --in that first version of my review, I gave Epic one star.  After reconsidering, I'm willing to give two stars but will never go back to Epic again.  We were in a party of 12 and had a dinner reservation for 9:30.  We arrived a little early and headed to the roof for a drink. All the seating was taken but the night was beautiful and, aside from the awful music, it wasn't a bad experience.  Then we went downstairs for dinner and our waiter was like a deer in the headlights --  he seemed inexperienced in dealing with a large group.  To be fair, he tried but lacked the authority to take charge of the situation and take our orders.  After awhile some in our party left the table to visit the restroom or to go outside for a cigarette.  Finally the waiter took our orders and it was almost 11:30 before our food arrived.  By then the dining room -- which was never full -- was empty except for our table. When I complained about the slow service, we were suddenly swamped with waiters and managers falling all over themselves to apologize.  Our young, inexperienced waiter was clearly out of his depth -- why didn't he get the help he needed earlier?  Our food wasn't bad -- but it wasn't worth the high price or the long wait.  Epic seems like the kind of place to have a drink, but not a place to stay and have dinner.  Also, anyone over 35 is going to feel out of place.  If you're an adult and want good food and good service in this neighborhood, go to Shaw's or to Phil Stefani's -- don't bother with Epic.",0.9896,0.804,0.155,0.041,0.4907936507936508

2010-07-26,4.0,"If you are looking for an amazing rooftop that will make you feel like you are in Miami and not Chicago, Epic's rooftop takes you there.  It's important to note that Epic is not only a rooftop bar (it's also a restaurant and indoor bar).  But I heard the stories that their bar was amazing, and that's what attracted me here. So this review is based on the rooftop experience to help you get an idea of what you might find.  The crowd you can categorize as mature professional. This means, 30 and up, with some guys there feeling obligated to have a blazer on (such a lame look during the summer, but to each his own...).  I think half the crowd here valeted their helicopter when they flew in.  The only way to get more cool people here is if they put it on the menu. They should hire me and have me in the back room on stand-by, and I'd occassionally come out anytime someone orders cool from the bar.  I'm sure I'd probably have a few cameos a night to water down the ""Sooo, what do you do for a living?"" conversations, prompted by the lonely 45 year old guy who is salavating at a chance to tell the hot 32 year old bombshell that he just closed on a deal in Paris and is really bummed he'll have to go there every few months.  In spite of this, I will come back...probably a few times. And here's why:  the staff there were extremely polite. Even the tough guy security brethren.  Every person who made eye contact with me spoke (at least 5 or 6 people). They greeted me when I came in, and thanked me when I left. I appreciate that because some establishments forget that goes a long way.  This rooftop is also too incredible to not bring 3 or 4 friends to and make your own little world.  The space is pretty big and people are mostly just standing around chatting. Its an open space with a good amount of seating against the walls.  True, pretentiousness is alive and well.

Well for this fan of Epic, I wanted to separate out my experience at Epic Sky from that of the regular restaurant as the two are as different as night and day.  After the long awaited opening of this rooftop bar (bar only, no food is served up on the roof) I have to say it left me a little flat. Maybe they are still working the kinks out, but there are better rooftop bars in this city, in my opinion.  The views are somewhat limited- you look out onto Hubbard Street as there are buildings blocking the other views. The cabanas are pretty cool although they are always reserved. For who?, I've wondered each time I've been here. As for your drink-know in advance that your drink will come in a plastic glass, it's nice plastic, but plastic nonetheless and it comes with a pretty big price tag ($12 - $14) for a mixed drink.  The bar area is pretty large but it still gets crowded with the after work crowd. Your best bet is to snag a table if you can get one as the servers are quicker at the tables than at the actual bar on some days.

I'm not a huge lamb fan but they were very good.   I then went up to the rooftop and the first thing it reminded me of was something you'd see in Miami or Vegas.  There were a few cabana type seating areas along with other seating along the sides.  The bar was fairly long and most of the furniture was white so it really has a modern, chic feel to it. The wine prices were not bad by downtown standards and the selection was pretty good.  The crowd was a mix between single groups of guys and girls to couples.  Definitely a place to go if you're looking to meet people or just want to have a romantic night with your date.

The food was bleh.   We ordered the scallops, salmon, halibut, and potato puree as a side. There was absolutely nothing special about the food.  The scallops weren't as bad but the halibut and salmon has absolutely no taste. I understand that restaurants are leaning towards the way of not destroying the original taste of the ingredient with too much other taste but still...it's gotta taste like something. Our favorite of the meal was the potato puree...that is so wrong. For dessert, we had a rhubarb thing with foam cubes and a mint chocolate brownie thing.  They were ok on terms of taste, but I'll give them points for presentation.  The desserts were presented in a very modern and chic style.

""Uhhh,"" you might think (or stutter for that matter), ""So then, why are you reviewing this place?"" Well, smart-ass reader, I'm reviewing it because I've had my mind blown a little bit. And when my mind gets blown, I fully believe you need to know about it. Katie, meet Table Service. Oh, nice to meet you! Gosh, I've heard so much about you, I can't believe we haven't had the pleasure before this! Oh, and Table Service, meet my seven friends that I brought along tonight, one of which seriously needs to get hammered before she gets hitched! Hope you're up for a fun night! Needless to say, Epic was up to the challenge. I had booked a midnight-thirty table for eight for a Saturday night, and seriously, the gods must have been smiling down upon me, because Table Service saved the night. Not only was there a crowd of people outside when our party arrived, there was an even bigger crowd on the main floor, that, in no way could we have navigated without huge bouncer dude w/ earpiece. But since we had TS on our side, we seamlessly swam through the sea of humanity, climbed the stairs to our little oasis above the crowd, and instantaneously understood the importance of the all-mighty TS.  And TS treated us well. With a bottle of Ketel One for all, the drinks flowed and the dancing did, too. Bridey got her groove on, and we all got shmammered. Our lovely waitresses doted on us and if the glass was empty, it was soon full again with our choice of mixer.  Epic, I'd like to thank you for popping my Table Service cherry. I'd also like to thank you for playing Top 40 with a little early 90's thrown in. I thank you for your gracious servers, your well-oiled club machine, and for Ryan, the dude who took my reservation. Four stars? Because holy crap, when you're up on the second floor, and you've had a bit, it is a fuzzy pain in the a** to lumber down to the BASEMENT to take a tinkle.

I must say they have! We were a mix of 50-something to the teens, with majority being a very social group of 20-somethings but we all share a spoiled obsession with food.  The gnocchi won us over and all the seafood starters were a hit.

A couple people who got the lamb were in love.  The most memorable dish though was the dessert.  I got the earl grey ice cream with blackberries and pear ""soup"" and it was perfect.  There were a lot of fun ice creams in the desserts actually like olive oil ice cream - I love this and give kudos to their pastry chef. But enough about food - the scene was awesome.  It's definitely a place I'll want to return to again because of the vibe and I know my girlfriends will love it.  It hasn't been corrupted by douchebags yet, I see, so that's a major plus.  The drinks are legit as well - I'd keep the cocktails in the same level as Nacional 27, Violet Hour, and the like.

2010-04-26,4.0,"Let me preface this review by stating that I didn't dine at Epic, I merely entered this establishment to partake in some good ol' fashioned degeneracy with a higher class of clientèle. Epic is perfectly fashioned to attract fake tans and fake... well, you know with an array of striped shirts and (way too) deep cut v-neck t-shirts. A few of the guys appear to be trying to fit into their girlfriends t-shirts and a few of the girls appear to be wearing dinner napkins... But it also has an appeal to the normal people of this world. There are plenty of individuals wearing completely normal and socially acceptable garments to make sure you don't feel left out. We ventured to Epic on a Saturday night to celebrate the 13th anniversary of a friend's 21st birthday and decided it might be good to attempt to enjoy a beverage per annum. Epic is indeed a perfect name for this establishment, you walk in to an epically sized great room, featuring a modern but clean bar and some table seating across from it. You feel like a little kid standing in front of the bar, as the backdrop is nearly 30 feet tall with massive mirrors stretching the height of it. The space is double wide (by Chicago standards) with a 2nd floor mezzanine in the back up the stairs which serves as a great place for table service and private parties, or even VIP. You have an elevated view of the room from ""the Mezz"" and can see everything that's going on. I never made it up to the third floor dining area because we didn't eat, but also because climbing all those stairs just looked exhausting after all the drinks. I've heard great things, and via their website, they appear to have a pretty excellent lineup of chefs and management. I don't know any of them by names, but they look pretty fricken' Iron Chef and official with their arms folded in their chef's coats. I am a big fan of the décor as soon as I step inside. I was especially fond of the lighting fixtures. What I wasn't such a fan of was the epically priced beverages. I understand that this is a higher-end establishment catering to a pricier patronage, but I don't enjoy paying more for beer in a bar than I would at a ball park. Two beers one cocktail comes out to an epic $24. An $8 average price point is a little over kill, and one would think that in this economy, people would spend less time trying to impress mere strangers with purchases of bottle service or top shelf liquors and spend more time spending less money and having more fun. But don't let yourself be fooled, I was no fun sponge, I drank like they were $4 beers and didn't leave until my face was numb. Epic is a great destination for an extravagant evening out, but at this price point, it's a bit uneconomical to become a once a week/regular hot spot for me. For those able to afford this place as your ""friendly, neighborhood watering hole,"" Cheers! Perhaps I'll see you there once a month or so. Before walking into a place called Epic, you wonder, how can an establishment ever live up to such a name? Should we make plans to drink at ""Slightly Above Par"" just in case Epic isn't?  Overall, I want to give Epic a solid rating and recommend it as a go to spot for when the local watering hole just isn't cutting it, and you feel like putting on clothes that may even require dry cleaning.",0.9984,0.785,0.18,0.035,0.47251851851851845

We both also ordered scallops for our entre and were both pleased. The scallops were perfectly cooked. That was pretty much enough to stuff us and we passed on desert. The portions are decent  size at Epic and definitely worth the price. Drinks -at least the ones I ordered- weren't as good as I anticipated. I ordered a drink called a sex panther (or something like that) and it tasted like a mango juice with Splenda. Although, I don't think it had any Splenda in it?  Service was impeccable all around.

That's exactly what I did which led me to Brett D's awesome review of this Chicago new hot spot which opened this past December.  I can tell you Brett D's review is completely spot on and written better than anything I'd likely write so check her review out and check out Epic! It was perfect for the group I was with.  In the mean time, if you're not convinced yet, here are some additional comments I hope you find interesting and useful:  + Hands down the staff favorite seemed to be the House Gnocchi. Turned out to be mine as well. Wonderfully light and fluffy plus the lamb sausage mixed in turned out to be a great touch. The Fennel artfully dusted across the top made the dish as much visually unforgettable as it's flavors and textures.  + One of the staff raved about the Halibut as having replaced the House Gnocchi as her personal favorite. I was intrigued with this apparently new dish but how could I not try the Spiced Lamb Shank after Brett D's review?!?! So it was Lamb two-ways for me when you include the Gnocchi. And yes, the Lamb Shank was excellent.  + The Seared Sea Scallops were just average to me so I'd say possibly pass  + Executive Pastry Chef Christine McCabe really creates some unique and interesting desserts. Check out the restaurant website for pictures of her truly artistic work. I had the banana split which is not at all heavy like it may sound and liked it quite a bit ...or would that be bite.  + Seating in the dining room is actually really nice if you don't sit next to the elevator. I didn't even know where it was. I sat toward the front and then to the middle when we needed a bigger table. Both spots were great!  + The Lounge apparently has a slightly different menu and mixes in a few more casual items. Might be just right for a late night snack.  + On Wednesday, the dining room was packed until about 9 or 10 PM. The lounge had a great vibe going but wasn't overly crowded. This again was perfect for the group I was with. Note, there are some great seating areas to the back left which are really nice for just hanging out with friends.  + Insiders tell me the lounge is the most busy Fridays and Saturdays after 11 PM; absolutely jammed packed so. Maybe its the fun sexy drink list that draws 'em in. For example, try the Sexy Panther. The name alone makes it fun. Actually I did try it. Nice flavor but possibly too sweet for some individuals.  Thanks again to Brett D for steering me in the right direction. And I totally agree on the sauces with the Oysters, WTF????",0.999,0.768,0.225,0.007,0.5820221836066908
2010-03-24,4.0,"When electing a name like Epic for your establishment, you better be damn well sure every piece of the total package puzzle is exactly that... utterly impressive, larger-than-life, undoubtedly flawless to the nth degree. While my time spent here certainly was more than pleasurable, Epic it indubitably was not.  Let's not be mistaken, you absolute will not go wrong selecting this locale for a sexy date, notable client dinner, fun girls/guys night out, trendy group get together or festive birthday soirée... in fact, bookmark now for any of the above occasions, just fine-tune your expectations with the following handy when-dining-at-Epic guidelines.  Things that really ARE Epic..........  I. The bar/lounge is a genuine hotbed of attractive social activity. You need not venture further than this area to be fed yummy morsels like Tuna Tartare Parisien, sip a lovely, full-bodied Argentine Malbec and hang with the local hotties. Yep, this is where the pretty guys and gals play while the bartenders pour the most fabulous dirty martinis *ever* serving only to compliment the revelry.  II. Décor fabulousness. Visually, the restaurant is quite beautiful... clean, sleek, modern, sexy, just how I like it! Three full floors of expansive glass, glittering chrome, dark wood, muted cream-colored fabrics and very flattering lighting. Spot on.  III. The following menu items: a) Arugula Salad with honeycrisp apples, medjool dates and ricotta salata. Fabulous combo that works beautifully to open the palate and tastes like a sweet, peppery heaven! b) The delightfully buttery and light Chilean Sea Bass, totally fresh, fully fantastic, really well executed. c) Spiced Lamb Shank... OMFG! Loved it. Great cold weather 'comfort' dish, but could just as simply be devoured any night of the week. Trust in the power of this rich, meaty, well-seasoned and absolutely beautiful hunk of lamb. Now THAT is Epic.  IV. My gorgeous dining companion (and twin) Caroline A., I'd be quite remiss in neglecting to mention her more than Epic camaraderie. I highly recommend you take her everywhere!  Things that really ARE NOT Epic..........  I. Being seated less than 3 feet from a heavily trafficked elevator. The glare of fluorescent lights every time it opened was jarring and the butts of people waiting for it (in your face as you eat no less) is even more obnoxious. This table placed so unstrategically is unnecessary, poorly planned and makes for a less-than-ideal panorama.  II. Oysters + Mustard = WTF? Ordered a smattering of East and West Coast oysters only to have them arrive with an accompaniment of what seriously looked like ketchup, mayo and mustard. Upon further inquiring we were informed the unsightly trio was in fact a cocktail sauce, meyer lemon mousse and dijonaise. Uh huh. Again. WTF? Aside from the cocktail sauce, the other two just do NOT belong with oysters and quite frankly, were disgusting with the raw shellfish. Stick to traditional mignonette, Epic, this was a mega fail of the grandest scale.  III. Our server was nice enough, but seriously lacked the panache and flair you'd expect for a restaurant with such grandiose. Would have liked a little more excitement and a lot less snoozeville from him... our free glass of moscato at the end of our meal was a nice touch (though somewhat forced upon him by our boisterous neighboring table cohorts) despite the fact it took over 20 minutes to materialize. Psst! I'm pretty sure he was secretly hoping we'd just leave.  Overall a solid, yummy and fashionable time was had by all. Epic shoes are big ones to fill, but definitely not unattainable. Try, try, try again my friend... a little sweat and a lot of spiced lamb shank go a long - and possibly even Epic - way.",0.9981,0.725,0.211,0.064,0.5809706383762986
2010-03-23,5.0,"The smile on my face hasn't been so ""ear to ear"" the entire duration of a dinner visit anywhere (well, besides Joe's Stone Crab, but they always have my heart). I'm telling you, Epic is amazing and if you haven't made a reservation, you need to do so A.S.A.P.  First off, the space is huge. It's certainly much larger than I could have expected with a lot more detail. When you walk in, the hostesses greet you with a friendly smile. When we walked in on a Friday night for our 8:30pm reservation, the place was bumpin' as every table was occupied.  With multiple levels, there's a different vibe to each floor. We were sat in the loft area, overlooking a huge room full of dinner patrons (which was amazing). The floor plan is very spacious which is refreshing because there's nothing worse than a cramped space for a romantic dinner.  The service was fantastic and our waiter was very friendly and informative when speaking of the house favorites. They have a really fun drink menu and we tried quite a few (but I can't remember the names). We started off with the House Gnocchi with lamb sausage...it melts in your mouth and the sauce is out of this world. We ended up dipping the remainder of our sour dough bread in it. For dinner I had the Bershire Pork chop which my friends had been raving about. In my opinion, it may have been the best I've ever had. I find that most places over cook the hell out of Pork Chops which causes the meat to lose all texture and flavor. This slab of meat was pure perfection, juicy as can be. The boyfriend ordered the Spiced Lamb Shank which to die for and very flavorful as well. I was blown away and we need to get back there pronto to the try the steaks, which have also been highly recommended. Who doesn't love dessert? Well, if you don't, there's something wrong with you. Per usual, I wanted everything, but that would be out of control if I had it all right? The Mint Chocolate Chip Brownie was the choice of the night and it was fab. Just the perfect ending to a perfect night. Go here. If you don't, you're out of your mind. For warmer weather, they're opening a huge rooftop.

I love the loft feel with exposed brick, floor to ceiling windows and dark ambiance. The music and large screen televisions on the first floor did not impress me, but the atmosphere on the second floor dining area was nice.  Our only gripe was where we were seated. We were seated right in front of the elevator... ugh. So we saw people coming up and down all night. When we first got upstairs, there were two people sitting at our table, and they decided to move to the next table over (where we were supposed to be seated). Um... awkward.  Anyway... now that I got that out of the way. The food was fantastic. I had their cheesy asiago bread, and it was carb heaven. Add some delicious creamy French butter, and it was roll your eyes back amazing.  We started with the oysters... because that's how we roll. The condiments were not all that exciting though, especially the mustardy one. Stick with the classic cocktail sauce.  I had the roasted beet salad. While it was very good, it still doesn't beat the beet salad at the Publican.  For dinner, we shared the Chilean Sea Bass and the Lamb Shank. Both were slam dunks. The Sea Bass was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. Our neighbors thought the Lamb Shank was a little too salty, but I loved it. It fell right off the bone, was super tender and flavorful.  We ended our meal with petit fours, which was just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth.  Afterwards, we ended up chatting with our neighboring diners and had a glass of Moscato. While he was super cute, it was a clear indication that the tables are a little too close together!  Note: When we left dinner, the lower level was FULL of men.

It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night but considering the river north location I wasn't too surprised.   First off the space is great, very open loft style with modern design elements. The bar is on the first floor and quite large. Although we made reservations for 6 we had a couple more folks join us which wasn't a big deal at all, the staff was able to accommodate us all quickly.  The dining area is located on the 2nd and 3rd floors. You can take the stairs up or elevator if you're not up for the climb. We started off with the lamb sausage gnocchi, crispy octopus and tuna tar tare. I have to say that the gnocchi was a treat for the taste buds . . so delicious! Main dish I ordered a medium rare NY strip with the peppercorn sauce and a side of brussles sprouts. The steak was not bad but not great, I needed to dip every bite into the sauce. As a rule with a good steak you don't need anything else. The brussels sprouts were amazing though, combined with honey, bacon and chestnuts.  Overall the food was good and the ambiance was great. The music was very Miami Delano-esque but not too loud. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive.

2010-02-15,5.0,"This place is legit.  I went to Epic for the first time last week (on a Wednesday.)  And I was thoroughly impressed with the staff, ambiance, and even more so with the food.   From the moment I met the valet, I was impressed.  I never had a valet person tell me 'give your ticket to your waitress 10 min before you leave, so your car is ready.'  Now was that groundbreaking--No;  however it was a nice touch.  Everyone at the door was super friendly (which is expected but not always practiced to be sure.)  My guest and I sat at the bar due to the # of people, and Matt (the bartender) was awesome.  Here's how I define awesome:  making sure my drink is refilled (or constantly getting me a new one if mine looks empty, being funny/witty, and making good food recommendations when I've never dined there before.)  It's sometimes hard to do that when there's a crowd.  But this guy was a pro. Now on to the steak: it was superb.  I've been to a lot of steak places in Chicago, and this was in the top 5.  My guest had the lamb, and that was pretty good too.  The bill was totally in line based on the number of alcoholic drinks (3 a piece), food selection, and location of the restaurant.  And I define 'in line' as under $150. Again--this is 5 stars folks.  I hope this spot isn't just awesome b/c it just opened.  I'll be sure to write a follow up review in 6 months to see if it stands the test of time.   If you're skeptical, go in one night and pull up at the bar for a moment or two.  If you're impressed, stay there a while....and at the very least try their popcorn.  It's sooooo money!",0.9958,0.783,0.193,0.024,0.6627462121212122
2010-02-15,3.0,"The aptly named Epic is truly that from the moment you step in.  Aside from the tastefully modern decor, the structure itself is truly impressive, with a large bar on the first floor, a 2nd floor main dining area, and separate 3rd floor/lofted seating.  Amuse Bouche | Wild-Boar and Foie Gras samosa-esque something or other: the flavors were well balanced with the foie gras smoothing out what could have been gamey boar. Just a touch greasy as the whole thing was deep-fried, but otherwise very good.  Bread | Apple Roll : usually bread isn't worth mentioning, but when my boyfriend hands it over to me after one nibble, fair warning should be given that there is an overpowering taste of fennel in what was described as a sweeter (fruitier) roll. First Course | Red Wine Cured Foie Gras : possibly the best dish of the evening.  A very interesting preparation for the foie gras, but executed perfectly; you could taste the red wine without it overpowering the subtle flavor of the foie gras (which was of excellent quality).  It was paired with a crispy squab that would have been fantastic by itself.  It was incredibly juicy and definitely held its own against the flavor of the foie gras and the sweet 'sour cherry'  Main Course | Seared Sea Scallops : The sea scallops were fresh and seared perfectly, but were a bit boring.  Everything seemed to go to mush in the mushroom soup the scallops sat in.  The dish was not bad, but was also far from impressive; and the foam is so 2004 Homaru Cantu - the dish would have been better off without it and with a cleaner presentation. Main Course | Filet : Very safe but not amazing.  Understanding that Epic is not a steakhouse and should not be compared to the countless perfectly grilled steaks across the city, this is still a pretty darn good steak and everything you'd expect: It's a filet. It's grilled.  Drink : Interesting wine selection. I'm hoping that the specialty cocktail selection will improve, but there is a fully stocked bar and friendly bartenders to create just about anything you'd like.  That being said, we went safe with a bottle of Veuve. Service : Excellent - the staff to patron ratio was impressive and it seemed everyone was on their best behavior.  Our server in particular was helpful and patient (i'm fairly indecisive), offering recommendations.  Hopefully this will continue past their opening. All in all, Epic left a very good first impression and will most likely go into the regular rotation.  Very reasonably priced, excellent quality food and fun atmosphere.",0.9994,0.686,0.291,0.023,0.5718537616229926
2010-02-14,4.0,"3.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous today...it's Valentine's Day after all! The hubby and I continued the tradition of celebrating vday on the 13th. See review from last year's celebration: yelp.com/biz/takashi-chi… However, the 13th wasn't a quieter dining night this time around since it fell on a Saturday. I think Epic managed to fill every table inside this massive restaurant of many levels, floor to ceiling windows and sophisticated decor.  The service is spot on and we enjoyed chatting with our waiter, Scott, as well as his dozen assistants who came to check on us throughout our meal.  The food is good, but nothing that will blow you away.  My valentine and I both agreed that for these prices it really should blow you away. They've got the sides down. Mothers could get their children to eat brussel sprouts if they were covered with honey, chestnut and bacon like they are here at epic. Waiter Scott told me that the yukon potato puree was well worth breaking any diet and I have to agree with him. The rest of the meal was fine. Our oyster app was a bit on the fishy side, although I've never had truly good oysters here in Chicago. I was excited to try the crispy octopus, but there wasn't much to try since the portion size was extremely small. I did like my chilean sea bass, but if I went back I'd probably opt for the hubby's sea scallops instead. They were (almost) as good as those sides.  For dessert we went right for the banana split. I really enjoyed it, although my husband was a bit disappointed there wasn't a real banana in there.  I'd probably be more likely to go back for cocktails in the lounge than dinner. While I stuck with 2 glasses of a perfect tasting Riesling, I also enjoyed the few sips I had of my husband's cocktails: The Black Magic (really good) and the Berry Smash. Overall, it was a very pleasant Vday experience, which should be expected for the $200+ we spent on dinner. At these prices I'll most likely be back for the lounge and any special promotions (noticed they are participating in the upcoming Chicago Restaurant Week).",0.9972,0.784,0.192,0.023,0.47609599395313684

Dining area is on the second and third floors, which was nice because you can still hold a conversation without worrying about the music coming from the first floor. A open outdoor area on the fourth (rooftop?) is set to open by the time Spring or Summer hits. In Chicago terms, when the weather finally has steady summer-like temperature...in July. (Just kidding.)  We had dinner reservations for 9 PM on Friday, which worked because it wasn't as crowded as we expected it to be, even during this Hallmark holiday weekend. Our server, Matt (or Mark?), was great the entire evening. With our of group of indecisive gals, his recommendations for wine, entrees, salads, and sides were pretty spot on. We each got our own entree but decided to split a variety of sides among us. I went with the scallops, which was good but not great. I'm kicking myself now because I tried the lamb and thought it was better than the scallops. By the by, the lamb is huge. There was enough to go around twice (maybe three times) to everyone at our table. I thought the spinach side was f'n awesome and went well with everything I tried.   Our food took over an hour+ after ordering (and we finished our bottles of wine before our dinner was served), and they gave us complimentary desserts for the wait. Unfortunately, I was too full to really enjoy them.  We had a nice ladies night out with good food and wine.  I'm not sure if I'd go back for dinner any time soon, but I think the lounge area makes for a nice place to grab a drink, pre- or post- dinner.

The room was mostly empty and all tables were already prepared- definitely a ""please order a $16 drink from the bar while you're (unnecessarily) waiting"" move. Also, as I was leaving a few people at the hostess stand asked about our experience. I commented--benignly--that the decor and vibe seemed New York-ish.

I'm not sure why a manager of a brand new restaurant would want to attempt to belittle a diner about their own opinions (not to mention well-earned reputations) and risk turning them off to the establishment.  A place as large and expensive as Epic will need repeat business and referrals to stay afloat in this economy.... something I will not be giving.",0.5528,0.82,0.097,0.083,0.5121479677729678

2010-01-17,5.0,"EPIC To start, I'll tell you that I consider myself a lucky guy.  I have more than a few incredible friends who live life at a level most of us are not able to attain.  These people set high standards and push and push and push until their goals come to life.  One of those folks is Steve Tavoso, and he has just opened EPIC in Chicago. I was lucky enough to be invited to the Grand Opening Party for EPIC this past Thursday and after checking out the menu and sampling some of the food, I decided to try it for dinner the next night.  After spending 2 nights there, I think it's safe to say that no matter how EPIC you want your night to be (Do you want a special dinner of Kobe Rib-Eye with a bottle of Bond cabernet?  Drinks in the bar, apps in the lounge and then more drinks on the roof top with great views of the city? All of the Above?), EPIC can handle it.   That said, I thought that most of the dishes and the wine list are very reasonably priced when you consider the quality of food and service that you will receive.  Don't think that every night at EPIC has to be epically expensive.  To me, this restaurant hits the ""sweet spot"" of elegant urbanity, delicious food and attentive service.   The Space As other reviews have stated, the space is note-worthy.  EPIC has four floors and a roof-top lounge that will open this summer.  And while the place will impress you with its size, it is far from over-whemling.  Regardless of where I was in EPIC, I was comfortable and engaged by the lighting, decor, music and the crowd.   In the restaurant, the tables are spaced so that I was aware of my fellow diners, but I didn't overhear their conversations.  Still, there was a feeling of community in the restaurant that night and we found ourselves talking to two different sets of people about their dishes and comparing notes. Food At any aspiring restaurant, the food must be the star and I found that true here.  The kitchen at EPIC is headed by chef Stephen Wambach, the former corporate chef for Laurent Tourondel's BLT Restaurant Group in New York.  I thought his dishes were creative, sophisticated and well-balanced.  How about an octopus appitizer where the ""fish"" is brined, blanched, then cooked in olive oil and lemon juice, before given a paprika coating and then fried?  With one bite, my mouth was filled with crunch, heat, sour tanginess, and richness.  That's pretty special in my book. We then moved on to the Roasted Beets and the Red and White Endive salads and the house gnocchi that was stuffed with lamb sausage and swiss chard.  As an entree, I had the Kobe Top Cap that had a nice char on the outside and with a warm red center throughout.  If you like a Filet but want something different, give this a try.  For sides, we tried the French Fries, Parsnip Puree and the Brussels Sprouts.  All were very good, but the Brussels Sprouts were my favorite.  They were served in a honey sauce with bacon and chestnuts that made them sweet, crunchy and savory.  Not only would any vegetable-hating pre-teen enjoy these, but I could have had them for dessert. Speaking of desserts, ours were rich, creamy and full of different textures.  Our table had the Banana Split, a Frozen Chartreuse Souffle, and the Pumpkin Ice Creme & White Chocolate Cake.  Of course, all of the ingredients were freshly made by Pastry Chef, Christine McCabe. Staff and Service I thought the service, like the food, was top-quality but very ""approachable.""  It wasn't too formal or pretentious ~ that would seem out of place here ~ but it was considerate and attentive.  I've read reviews of a hovering staff, but I did not notice any of that even though I was an invited guest of the restaurant the night before.   My server was knowledgeable about the dishes and their preparation, yet wasn't preachy or condescending.  The General Manager, Rob, was present on the dining room floor and observant.  When I wanted to order a bottle of wine, I was able to quickly get his attention with a nod.  I love that.  I've been in enough restaurants where the staff are more pretentious than the poser crowd they ""serve"" (Does a certain sushi restaurant in the River North area come to mind?), and it's ridiculous.  EPIC gets it right and my hat is off to them for that accomplishment. Despite still being full from Friday's dinner (It's Sunday now), I am ready to return.  I want to sit at the bar and have Jude, the affable French bartender, pour me a drink and tell me about his travels while I try to speak to him in French and butcher his native tongue.  And just thinking about the food is making my mouth water.  I want to try the Tuna Tartare and the Spiced Lamb Shank next time I'm in town.  Some other time, I'll have to see what Chef Wambach can do with the Chilean Seabass.  One of our dining neighbors really enjoyed her dish.  And I'll have to return yet again for the Bone-In Veal Chop with a porcini-parmesan crust.  I think that 2010 will be an EPIC year for me.",0.9985,0.861,0.129,0.01,0.5174084595959595
2010-01-11,5.0,"Went here for some drinks at about 10PM on Saturday night. We were with friends of the owner so we were treated fantastic however, the staff seemed awesome to everyone else there as well. The place hasn't even had its official grand opening and it was already pretty rocking. We didn't eat, but the menu looks amazing and I look forward to returning soon for a meal.  The space is huge and has a great, cool vibe but doesn't come off as trying too hard. The roof top opening in the summer will be sure to rival any of the other similar destinations in the area.  Looking forward to enjoying more at this dining/social scene.",0.9874,0.714,0.275,0.012,0.7270370370370371
2010-01-10,3.0,"Like some men, Epic is designed to cover up character flaws by impressing with size. It's the Excalibar of restaurants- a gargantuan, multi-floor dining monster. To fill up the place, it may need to resort to flyering cars.   For appetizers, the octopus was distinct. These large cuts of semi-fatty crispiness are worth a gander. The tuna tartar and hamachi were asi asi. For entrees, only tried the sea bass. Unfortunately, it oozed water, slowly killing my Belvedere buzz.  Dessert was redemption, especially the delightfully rich mint and brownie. The service was earnestly chatty, though there was a distracting surplus of staff huddling near our table. In conclusion (why not finish off a Yelp review as you would a 6th grade paper), test drive the place for the views and use it to bookend your night with apps or dessert.",0.6749,0.823,0.104,0.074,0.5898809523809524
2010-01-07,5.0,"Epic was an epic experience. I have to say, I was surprised and impressed with everything from the time I walked in. From the outside I had no idea what to expect, but the atmosphere fits the name perfectly. Everything is big, and the exposed brick walls are classy instead of being cliche. The staff was impeccable; from the girls who greeted us at the door, to the wait staff, and even the sommelier who personally offered suggestions to us with each course. The gnocci appetizer was out of this world, and I think should be added to the menu as an entree as well. We also had the lamb shank which was prepared perfectly. I think it is Epic's attention to detail in each dish really makes the experience, you can tell with each bite that whoever put the dish together is paying attention to detail. We had three appetizers, two entrees, and three sides, plus the mint/chocolate dessert which consisted of a brownie type cake topped with mint ice cream made with real mint leaves, not imitation flavoring (delicious!).  So as a true Chicago foodie, you can trust my word, try this place, you will not be disappointed!",0.9899,0.809,0.177,0.014,0.5611111111111111
2010-01-05,5.0,"Amazing! I tried a bit of everything here, and I must say it is EPIC. I love the NYC Lofty feel of this restaurant - very chic and sophisticated.  And don't forget to save room for dessert - the banana split is like none other.",0.9441,0.6,0.351,0.049,0.5958333333333333
2009-12-30,3.0,"I am torn.   The place is brand new and I expect there to be a few ""bugs to work out"".  In my opinion, the service was downright obtrusive.  Our waiter was extremely pleasant and professional, offering ideas but not pushy.  However, between him and all of the stewards, we could hardly finish a sentence.  I am sure in the weeks to come, they will calibrate this.  I will say also that they mastered a very hip decor with warm appeal, and are not stuffy about it.  I did think the food was quite good, but rich and pricey.  Go try it for a special date or occasion or simply to have a drink in the absolutely gorgeous first floor bar.",0.9825,0.761,0.228,0.011,0.5331194599051742

2009-12-22,5.0,"WOW!  Epic is an excellent restaurant. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a nice night out. It's not outrageously priced but a bit more than I normally spend....a perfect place for a great dinner out. I went with a group of four ladies and we all loved every minute.  To start, the space is amazing - tons of tables, ceilings are exceptionally tall and the lighting is incredible. We each had a glass of wine at the bar before dinner and the bartender was extremal friendly. Afterwords, the hostess led us upstairs to our table which over looked Hubbard Street.  Our incredible waiter went through the menu and offered many suggestions. For our apps. we went with the tuna tar tare and lamb sausage - gnocchi. I loved both but the gnocchi was TO DIE FOR. I literally woke up today thinking about it.  Now.. onto dinner...entrees included 7 pepper hanger steak, pork chop, scallops and chilean sea bass with sides of baby brussel sprouts and yukon potatoes. Each entree was incredibly flavored and cooked to perfection. My favorite was the pork chop (topped with a slice of bacon!) followed by the hanger steak w/ bearnaise sauce, chilean sea bass and scallops. The bone-in pork chop was huge and juicy with great coloring. The hanger steak was sooo tender and delicious and I can't give enough props to the bernaise sauce. Each of the fish plates were excellent but the sea bass was the stand out in my mind. Yummy Yummy Yummy.  We finished our meal off with the banana split and brownie with mint ice cream desserts. Again, each were fantastic.  Although, I wish there was a bit more mint ice cream on the brownie b/c I've never tasted ice cream like this.  I was literally an explosion of flavor in your mouth.  All-in-all a great experience from start to finish. I asked the group what they would change about the night and we couldn't think of anything. However, looking back they servers kept asking if they could take our coats. That would be my only complaint....service was too attentive? Is that bad?   Cheers!",0.9985,0.728,0.246,0.026,0.7544761904761904
2009-12-16,4.0,"Ate there last night while on a business trip in Chicago, it was its second night of operation.  There was nobody there so I was a little nervous, but boy what a surprise.  The food was outstanding.  One of the best tuna tartare dishes I've ever experiencesd as an appetizer.  Then I had the veal chop which was a sight to behold.  Amazing.  Everyone at our table loved the food and wine.  Dessert: banana split, out of this world.  I'll def. go back.",0.9798,0.732,0.252,0.016,0.4302083333333333
