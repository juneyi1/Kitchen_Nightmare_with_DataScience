2017-06-10,5.0,Of the 4 things best about pizza I had 3 this time. The ones I love are 1-thin crunchy crust. 2-sauce that does not taste like a tin can ot too acidic. 3- generous with the cheese. The fourth is getting someone else to pay. I was alone so I missed that one. Well worth the visit. Thick crust pizza is artificial to Chicago. As a boy all the pizza here was thin. Someone made up Chicago style. It is more like a sandwich. Try the thin crust and you will be happier and skinnier.,0.8913,0.717,0.183,0.1,0.5194444444444444
2017-04-29,1.0,"I'm pretty sad to write this review as I've had pizza from here before and thought it was fairly good. I placed an online order at 4pm for a 7pm delivery. Within a few minutes, I received an email confirmation that the order had been placed and my credit card had been charged X amount. Ok, thought everything was good. At 6:30pm, I received a second email stating my order was ready and would be out for delivery with an estimated arrival time of 7:06pm.  At 7:45, I called the store to ask if my order was in fact on the way. The woman who answered said she could not find a record of my order anywhere, refreshed the online system, then read to me the names of all the orders they received on her shift (4 total, a violation of privacy in my opinion, and completely unnecessary for me to know). I said I simply wanted to make sure my card was not charged as I had received an email receipt that it was. She could not tell me this information so took my number to call me back. No call back.  I will never patronize Apart again, which is sad because the pizza's not too bad. But how can you have an ordering system that sends not one, but two confirmation emails to customers and you supposedly have nothing on your end?  The worst system of ordering and customer service I have ever experienced. I also have to now follow up with my bank to cancel the transaction that did go through for the order that apparently didn't go through. Wtf.

2017-04-08,2.0,"Decided to try something new and order from Apart which is within walking distance. Unfortunately the experience was not good. I ordered online and chose takeout and was given a time to pickup my order. I walked several blocks from my apartment and arrived after the time I was given but they had no record of my order. The two ladies behind the counter did some digging and also refreshed the online system. That helped as the order popped up and they said the online system must never have refreshed so they never saw it come through. They offered to push my ticket to the front of the line. I asked how long it would be so I could come back and was told at minimum 25 minutes or they could deliver it no charge but would take much longer (they just quoted a phone order 90 minutes for delivery). I chose to leave and come back.  As I arrived back at my front door(less than 10 minutes), I received a call that they found my order. Surprise! The order had come through all along, was prepared before I got there, but was told it was set aside for delivery so they didn't see it. So I turned around and went back, picked up my order with a side of ""sorry I'm pretty new"". I was offered a bottle of water or drink for my trouble, which I turned down.  Once home with the food, pretty disappointing. I could have forgiven an order error on a busy Saturday evening and new employees if the food made up for it.  I ordered garlic knots, which online said comes with red sauce and a side of ranch. My order had neither (maybe I should have checked after all that!). It wouldn't have been a big deal if the knots hadn't been horribly overcooked. Visbly you could tell they were burnt as they were a mix of dark brown and black. They were hard as a rock(I actually had to use a steak knife to cut them!), and super dry so that sauce would of made some of a difference. The pizza was just ok. The crust edges were cooked nice and crispy but the rest of the pizza seemed slightly underdone and was sloppy.  Needless to say for a place within walking distance, it's disappointing i won't want to go back.

I worked at a pizza place for almost three years so I am usually incredibly sympathetic and patient with others in these situations, but this experience was just too bad. I called and asked if they had gluten free pizza and they said yes which was great! I ordered a gluten free half cheese half sausage with extra cheese. They said delivery time would be about 45 minutes to an hour, reasonable and fair. They came early, after about half an hour and I took the pizza up to my dorm.  I opened the box and I saw the most despicable pizza I have ever seen. The toppings were completely slid to one side and it had the wrong toppings, it seemed as though egg was dripping out of one corner of the box onto my carpet.  I called calmly and told them the situation and they were very nice about it and they said they'd send another right away. Great! It arrived in about 45 minutes, totally fine, and this time I checked it while the delivery guy was still there.   I opened the box and it seemed okay except it wasn't cut. I live in a dorm and have no need for kitchen knives so I didn't know what to do. I called them, after the delivery man seemed to be fumbling around his phone for a few minutes and not making any progress, and they said they didn't have a knife to cut gluten free pizzas and it said that on the website. When I called I had to ask if they had gluten free so obviously I didn't see the website. Why sell gluten free pizza if they can't even invest in a knife to cut it?! I just said okay and went upstairs and cut my pizza with a plastic fork; safe to say it didn't go well.  Their lack of communication with each other is what makes them deserve one star. The pizza itself was fine I guess but it definitely did not have extra cheese so it's a shame I had to pay for that.

2015-08-29,2.0,"We've been loyal customers to Apart for several years, telling lots of people in the Chicago-area that they had the best pizza around. However, after several service snafus--and food that seems to have diminished in quality--I don't think we will be ordering again. The straw that broke the camel's back was our experience this evening. We have a newborn baby at home and family visiting. So, at 7:15, we ordered $80 worth of food from Apart, using GrubHub for our order. Our receipt was emailed immediately, and GrubHub said our order would be delivered between 8:30-8:40. At 8:45, I called Apart to inquire about our order. The manager who answered the phone seemed completely unconcerned about the fact that he had ""just received the order"" through his fax machine. I informed assured him that we'd placed our order at 7:15 and that we had a receipt (attached), but he wasn't phased. ""Well, I just got it, and it won't be ready until after 10:00."" There were no apologies. No offers of discounts or free product. No commitment to rush the order. The nonchalance was infuriating. I mean, c'mon, say SOMETHING. Instead, he completely pawned the mistake off on GrubHub and continuously said, with an attitude, that I could either ""cancel the order through GrubHub"" or ""wait until 10:15.""  When I asked for his name, he said ""it is GrubHub's fault"" and hung up on me. He's a 20-30 male, working as manager of the Bryn Mawr location on Saturday, August 29.  Long story short: I called GrubHub, and no one answered. Apart insisted that they can't cancel my order, and they still refused to offer any compensation for the fact that our pizza, which was ordered at 7:15, wasn't delivered until almost 10:15.  Though, judging by these recent reviews, many of which echo the same service issues, I'm not sure anyone will care that their restaurant is being handled so poorly.  Look, maybe this WAS GrubHub's fault, though many people on Yelp have said that Apart claims to have lost their tickets. Still, ultimately, Apart chooses to partner with GrubHub. Apart will get my $80. And Apart handled this mishap as poorly as they possibly could have.  So poorly, in fact, that they've lost this customer.",-0.9823,0.836,0.045,0.119,0.4494123931623931

2015-06-16,5.0,"I ordered take out on Friday 6/12/2015, had no issues with orders, sizes, etc.  Also, they answered the phone immediately.  I mention all of those because of other not so good service reviews.  Also, they were pretty friendly upon pickup.  Maybe not the friendliest, but perfectly fine, no bad feelings, even got a smile. Also, I've noticed most of the bad reviews deal with cold pizza.  Look, I don't know how else to say this - this pizza is thin.  Super thin.  Unless you live 15 minutes away, it's going to get cold unless you eat in.  I picked it up on a warm night, put the two small boxes in a foil lined grocery bag and zipped it, and covered everything in a towel and another bag.  Drove about 30 min home.  It was warm, not hot.  The ones in the foil pouch did better. I did then put them in a warming oven, and they heated right back up (I slightly wilted my arugula).  I don't do gluten free, I understand as others have said it's tricky - maybe it's not a good idea to get it here unless you're eating there?  I guess what I'm trying to say here after all of this is that it's NOT going to be hot.  I believe everyone that sometimes the delivery times are absurd, which is why I'll pick it up myself....but I'll also know that it's not going to be piping when I get home. Anyway, the pizza freaking rocks.  I spent too much time on a Friday agonizing on where to get good thin crust.  My husband loves it and I only love it if it's great.  I'm a thick crust girl.   This is oven fired, super thin crust Italian pizza, and it's very very good. We ordered the arugula pizza, the pepperoni/sausage/mushroom, a ham/brie/egg, and two desserts - nutella with banana and the apricot. Arugula pizza: Needed a LITTLE more salty flavor - I added fresh grated pecorino romano at home.  But still, 4/5 stars.  Pepperoni/sausage/mushroom: mushrooms were fresh and super thinly sliced, which is important, the pepperoni is great, and I'm EXTREMELY picky with sausage - it was great.  Super fennel-y, well seasoned, not gristly 5/5 Ham/brie/egg: Incredible.  I could die.  The ham is to die for and I'm now planning on getting more of their ham based pizzas.  Of course, I got take out, so the egg wasn't super runny, but still, didn't really matter. 5/5 Desserts:  both are really good, but they were heavy on the dough, and the fillings thin out at the tips of the crescent.  I cut both into 4, and really, only the middle pieces (the thick parts) had enough filling.  I suggest splitting only with 2 people so you get enough filling per person.  Also, note they are a little bit tough and not light/crispy.  They aren't bad at all, and the fillings themselves are well executed.  I just wanted to give you an idea of what to expect and know that the tips aren't full.  3.5/5",0.9692,0.722,0.155,0.124,0.61358893557423

2015-06-10,3.0,"My fiance and I had a random pizza craving last night at 9 PM, so we thought we'd check this place out. We've heard really good things about their thin crust pizza -- it's supposed to be as close to New York pizza as you can get -- and that's what we were in the mood for. The situation was a little awkward. We knew they closed at 10, but we got there at 9:15 and all the stools and chairs were put up on the tables. We had to double-check to make sure it was open and that there were actually workers in the place. But, we ordered our pizza and all went smoothly. As far as atmosphere, this place is pretty cool. It's extremely casual with a few tables and benches for people to sit. I wouldn't recommend going here with a large group of people, since space is fairly limited, but if you're there when it's slow, they have some good board games and for you to play while you wait. There's also a chalk board at front, but again, if it's busy, it'd be kind of awkward to draw on it, since it's right in front of the ordering counter. Going here during a time when they aren't about to close would probably be fun, and they're a BYOB place, so it's definitely now on our radar for places to hang out. The pizza itself was delicious. If you're looking for an affordable thin-crust pizza, this is where you want to go. For the two of us, it cost under $20, and we completely polished it off. We ordered a Queen Margherita and were pretty happy with it. The ""fresh"" tomatoes weren't as fresh as they could have been, but again, we got there fairly close to closing. The lunch deals are much better and we're going to try making this place a go-to for a Saturday brunch/lunch. Their combos are significantly cheaper during their lunch time (you can get a pizza that serves 3-4 and a 2-liter coke for under $20), and they offer free shipping from 11 AM - 3 PM. Since we went late night, we're not sure how this is going to work out, but we're excited to try.

We have given them several chances because the pizza is really good. But every single time they screw up our order. Like really screw it up. Every time.  One time they sent us a small instead of an extra large then made us wait an hour to ""exchange"" pizzas for our original size. That resulted in two hours of waiting for all of us to eat a cold rushed pizza and one of those hours was spent smelling the one we were supposed to turn in for the correct size. Any customer minded business would have comped their original mistake and let us eat it. They acknowledged it was their fault but made us wait. Zero apologies or concessions. They have put the wrong ingredients on (meat for vegetarians), forgotten all our sides, drinks or salads.  They called us one time because our (very simple) order confused them. Then blamed the web ordering system for their confusion which they ask everyone to use (rather than Grub Hub which a note on their pizzas explains takes a percentage) saying their online system isn't very good. Than why the note that they prefer we use that system? Tonight I had to call 17 times before getting through to order by phone thinking that maybe that would be better... it wasn't.  Last time I ordered (and waited 90 minutes), that the delay was because they proudly make their pesto (on their menu) fresh everyday and it was really good. Tonight I asked for pesto and the guy said they don't have pesto. I asked if they were out and he said they have never had pesto on the menu and don't have any there. Trying not to be argumentative, I said I was surprised because we had ordered it before. He kind of laughed and said ""You sure?"".  They also gave me a free coupon when the pesto pizza had taken so long, which I now understand was because they don't have any so they had to manifest it from the thin air ;) ... but wrote on it  for a free ""dessert"". That was nice, but they don't have desserts. I'm sitting here with the coupon clearly saying Pizza Apart on it and the words Dessert and the name of an employee Bianca...

When we pulled up, we thought perhaps we had misunderstood, and you could only order for take out -- it looks like a simple storefront with a window for ordering, but we took a chance and walked in. There are only three tables in this location, so we were lucky we got there early. It was a Friday night around 6:30 when we arrived and there was only one table left.   Since all three of us were new to Apart, we ordered a bunch of food to try different things. Starting out, we had the Garlic Bites. WOW! They were not like any garlic knots (as they are usually called) I've ever had -- these were pull apart, and had the perfect mix of doughy goodness and garlic, which were served with both marinara sauce and ranch.   Time for pizza! Still skeptical that there was no deep dish, I already was counting on not liking it, but I was pleasantly surprised.   Apart's thin crust is the thinnest crust I've ever seen. It's so thin you almost don't think it could hold any toppings. Hand-tossed and gluten free, it is absolutely perfect. The first pizza we tried was the Cacciatore: Ham, pepperoni, bacon, onions and garlic. The presentation was great and it was so homemade we almost felt like we had made it ourselves.   Next we tried the Greca: Feta cheese, peppers, fresh tomatoes, black olives and onions. I am not sure if the Greca is my favorite, or if the Pollo Tuscano is. That pizza contained more fresh vegetables and feta, and was served with oven baked chicken breast on top that was so moist, I almost wanted to order strips of it to take home.   I really liked the freshness of all of the ingredients, the uniqueness of the pizza combinations and toppings, how bright and clean the small dining space was, and that each pizza was better than the next. Though I was hoping to have dessert after seeing that almost all the desserts were made with Nutella, after 10 slices I was pretty much done for the evening, if not the next two days. Having eaten more than I think I ever had in one sitting, I was not at all uncomfortably full as I usually am after eating my weight in deep dish pizza. I attribute this to the crust not being so heavy?   There are so many pizzas, salads and desserts to choose from, I will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone",0.9983,0.789,0.181,0.03,0.5524524804697218

2014-02-03,2.0,"Personally I love the pizza here. I know it's not everyone's favorite thin crust, but I do enjoy it and there really are not a whole lot of choices in the area for delivery of any type of food. Unfortunately it is an incredible pain to order a pizza for delivery from Apart. I usually avoid GrubHub because the whole middleman thing seems to delay deliveries, but Apart rarely answers their phone. One time I called the other location to ask if this one closed, they told me to use GrubHub to order. So I used GrubHub. And I didn't get any food for 3 hours. No I am not embellishing this story. After 1 hr and 15 minutes I called the location and they finally answered. I was told that the kitchen didn't receive my ticket, so she apologized and added a free dessert. Another hour later I called again, she said the driver was on the way. 45 minutes later I called again and was told he should be there soon and my meal was comped. It's great that they comped my pizza, and I got over it. Until tonight when I spent the past 20 minutes trying to call before 9:45 to order a pizza. No one answered and I am obviously not going to bother with ordering from GrubHub anymore. Basically the pizza is pretty good, considering there are not many options in the area, but they don't seem to know how to professionally run a business.

I ordered the Capriciosa Pizza with a side of pizza sauce on a gluten-free crust via GrubHub. It took about an hour. Fine. It was small (10"", maybe) which was also fine. But it arrived cold, which destroys a gluten-free crust. I also received no pizza sauce, but got to pay for it (yaaaay). I said, ""Hey -- it's cold outside. Things get cold. I'll just reheat it."" Which made it disgusting. I threw the entire thing away and ordered another pizza from elsewhere. Which took another hour. I tried calling the GrubHub customer service line and hung up after being on hold for 20 minutes. And here's the thing -- I know stuff happens. I know gluten-free crusts are tricky. But if you're going to offer one, it had better be delicous and it had better be hot. I can think of many a thing I'd have liked to have spent $20+ for my birthday -- hookers, blow.

2011-05-09,4.0,"We've ordered delivery from Apart on Broadway probably 10 times.  I bought up a ton of the Living Social/Groupons when they were offered, with no doubt that I would use them before they expired.  So glad I did.   Their pizzas are great.  You can tell that they use good quality cheese and other ingredients.  I prefer a chewier crust really, but this is the closest thing I've found to floppy NY style pizza within delivery range since I've lived in Chicago.   Our most repeated choices are the arugula and goat cheese, and the one with ham, egg, and brie.  We've ordered lots of others that have been great though.  The signature, the one with all the meat and bacon and garlic, pepperoni, margarita, and arugula with tomato - some are light, some are really heavy, so chose wisely.  No complaints on any of them.   Their salads are great - when they get them right.  We often get the wrong dressing, the wrong salad altogether, or just one ingredient that's off.  Once we ordered the spinach salad, and instead we got a big container of arugula - no spinach.  We surely would have made a different choice had we known.  Sometimes you just want what you want.  The only other issue we've had is that the pizzas arrive cold.  Well maybe not cold, but definitely not piping hot.  Warm.  Warm pizzas, not hot pizzas.  We pretty much always have to throw a few slices on a sheet in the oven for a few minutes before we eat.   Neither the salad orders getting messed up or the cold (aka warm) pizzas have deterred us from ordering from here all the time, so obviously the end result is totally worth it.",0.8546,0.783,0.12,0.097,0.6271942110177406

The customer service is downright amazing. Really, service this good is basically unheard of these days. I need to be extremely certain that I won't get sick, so I down right grilled them on their GF process.  They took my concerns very seriously when I told them about my gluten allergy as they have family with celiac disease. The owner spoke directly with me and assured me the staff would make sure that my pizza never came in contact with any other flour. She informed me they have a pre-made Gluten Free Schar dough from Germany (to avoid cross contamination that could occur if it were made in house).  She let me know that it has more of Bruchetta in its bite, but I found it to be much 'fluffier' and 'pizza like' than other GF dough I have tried. They have a set process where they place it on a clean pan with foil to avoid airborne flour and do not cut the pizza to avoid mistakes where they accidentally use the same pizza cutter they used on the other pizza. We hosted a party with mixed pizza types, my family loved their gluten filled dough, and the GF types loved our pizza. The verde was my personal fav.

The staff was friendly both on the phone and in person.  I butcher how I say new foreign words pretty badly.  They were able to translate my attempts into what I meant.  Gold star to them.   Pizza... The box felt really really light.  Granted, I'm used to eating deep dish pizza where even a small weighs as much as a brick. We are in Chicago, Deep Dish is a bias even for us transplants (6yrs in the city).   Tasted good.  It had a nice sweetness to it, crust was moist without being mushy in the middle with a definite crunch the closer to the edge that you got.  Very little sauce, thin layer of cheese, with about 2 inches or so between pieces of sausage.  Somehow, this minimal approach worked.  I ate half the pie in a sitting, feel delightfully gross, and will be slipping into a food coma within about 10mins.   Would I buy their pizza again?  Probably, but I'd need to be in the right mood.  I'd do delivery next time.  At this point, there are other places that are much closer to me that I haven't tried yet.  Also, I live across the street from a Giordano's...I'm a regular there for a reason (with a waist line to prove it).    Raspberry Chocolate Filoncino Why have I not heard of these before?  Tis a tube pastry thingy filled with sweet concoctions.  The glutton in me approves of these things many times over.  I had no idea what they were going into this, I figured it'd be like a Sweet Pizza thing from Papa Johns or Domino's...and I was way off.  Eating it, I feel like I'm inviting diabetes into my life.   Would I buy one of these  Raspberry Chocolate Filoncinos again?  Yes.  Many times over, yes.  I think it might taste amazing frozen/chilled.  However, I try not to eat this type of sugar load more than once every month or two.   Conclusion: If they do a Groupon again, I'll buy it again.  If I move to within walking distance of the joint, I'll buy it frequently.  With where I live now?  Maybe twice a year.  Who knows, I plan on eating the rest of this pizza for lunch tomorrow, so if it is amazing cold/the day after, I might order more frequently.",0.9946,0.844,0.135,0.022,0.5134150849150848

I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant (which I understand is tiny and has a very strange soda fountain that is sits uncomfortably high). I find the pizza to be consistently good and delivered fast. We typically order early (between 5-6pm) and usually order 4-5 of their 10"" classic or signature pies (which more than feeds a family of 3). This provides plenty for dinner and leftovers for Saturday breakfast, lunch or midnight snack. They run a regular special (which you sometimes have to ask for) and offer a free can of soda with each 10"" pie.  As for the food. The pizza is very thin crust and I have not found the cheese to be greasy (as other reviewers have posted.) I'm not a fan of their onions since they are tend to be semi-cooked and not so good for my digestion. The Cacciatore (w/o onions) is yummy!!! So rich and flavorful. I enjoy the Greca, although I wish they would add sauteed spinach to it. The margarita is good, but too plan for me. We always order the Hawaiian for the kids and they love it. And we just started ordering the Pollo Tuscano which is also good and one of the few selections with Chicken.  My only bad experience with this place was a delivery that went awry.

Apart offers a pizza that seems most similar to the Neapolitan offered by places like Spacca Napoli: a light, thin crust, crispy around the edges yet soft where covered by a fine layer of sauce and cheese. I ordered the Hawaiian, which came with a well-proportioned amount of ham and pineapple. Nothing about the pizza was too intense or heavy, just rich and flavorful. I got carry-out, and the pizza had definitely cooled off a bit during the trip home, so I can see how people might have less-than-satisfactory delivery experiences. This does seem the sort of pizza that is best eaten at the restaurant, but don't let that discourage you from taking one home. It was still delicious eaten on my couch.

I ordered the caprese style salad and the very friendly employee informed me that, while he'd be happy to prepare that salad for me, the arugula they had available was not as good as usual. Then he recommended preparing it a different way so that I would not be disappointed... I have to say, this impressed me. It is very rare, in my experience, that an employee gives honest feedback as to the quality of the food, especially when it wasn't even solicited. I definitely appreciated being told upfront and given the option to change my order so that I wouldn't be stuck paying for a salad I'd be disappointed with.  Now, to the pizza.... We ordered a medium pepperoni and green pepper pizza and, I have to say, it was delicious! Love love love the super thin crust.

Got there to dine in at about 7 on a Friday night (we were going to do delivery, but based on previous reviews we just didn't want to take that risk) and had our choice of the three tables they have. The soda fountain was literally tall enough for me to take a shower under (I am not a short person). I actually had to reach my arm up to fill up my cup. Seems unnecessary, but I got a laugh out of it. Plus soft drinks are included in the price of the pizza.  We ordered two 10"" pizzas: the Capra-Ruccola (goat cheese and arugula) and the Cacciatore (ham, pepperoni, bacon, onions, garlic). Yeah that's right, a meat pizza. I'm eating meat and I'm a bad Lenten-Friday Catholic. What are you gonna do about it? When the pizzas came out I was a little disappointed to see that the arugula on mine was just thrown on top, raw. It took away from the flavor of the goat cheese, which was my main motivation for choosing the Capra-Ruccola in the first place. The chevre-to-mozzarella ratio was also kind of a bummer; the mozzarella diluted the earthy flavor of the goat cheese. The Cacciatore was a little more in line with my expectations (it's basically just a meat lover's pizza except with onions and real garlic). The bits of garlic added a great flavor. My main problem with both of the pies was the crust. It was a little too matzah-ey for my taste. I don't like my pizza crusts crunchy, and I really didn't like walking out covered in crust crumbs.

2008-04-03,5.0,"We had ordered from nearly a dozen pizza delivery places in the Andersonville/Uptown area in the past 15 months, and never quite found what were looking for: quality ingredients, imaginative menu, healthy options ... those types of requirements are usually reserved for sit-down dining. That is, until friends introduced us to Apart Pizza on Broadway.  Apart Pizza is a pizza flavor orgasm for your mouth with free delivery during peak delivery hours (!). They make incredible pies like the vegetariana (artichokes, corn, peppers, fresh tomatoes, spinach) and the cacciatore (ham, pepperoni, bacon, onions, garlic) ... and super yummy salads with brie and cranberries. The pizza is very thin, which normally I don't go for, but is so delicious I make an exception.  We will no longer order from the dozen other places... Apart is now our pizza home base.",0.9451,0.841,0.14,0.019,0.6661111111111111
2008-03-22,3.0,"When it comes to pizza, this girl isn't hard to please. Slap some sort of dough with some sort of cheese and wipe some sauce on it, heat...and give it to me. I'm happy.  So, it's Friday night. We just got about 57 inches of ""heart attack"" thick snow, and I don't feel like moving out of my corner of the world. I have one hard boiled egg, a lonely mini pickle and hummus in my fridge and despite my resourcefulness I cannot think of a way to concoct a meal out of these ingredients.  So, I want pizza delivery. In an attempt to broaden my 'za horizons I check Yelp, of course. Apart's got good reviews for both locations, but the Edgewater one is a bit closer so I ring them up.  2.5 hours later I finally have pizza. Sad, little, limp, coldish pizza. :( I know it was not the best of conditions and everything, but in 2.5 hours I could've walked there, made it myself, walked back, eaten it, walked the dog, read a good book and done my laundry.  The toppings, while good in theory were poorly executed. Note to self: never order a pizza with an egg on it, eggs are not meant to be mingling with pizza. They forgot the Caprese salad and I think instead I got a mini pizza with spinach, corn and tomato on it. Odd. Corn is another ingredient I don't find works with pizza, but that is just my opinion.  I truly believe this experience would've been drastically different had I been able to motivate myself enough to actually leave the house and go out for pizza. Hence, 3 stars and I'll make a return trip... But, no delivery from Apart for me again...I shall stick with Pizza Rustica. So much for trying to be inventive ;)",-0.2372,0.833,0.084,0.083,0.5826388888888888
2007-12-31,4.0,"Finally a neighborhood pizza place that my wife doesn't dismiss as ""too creepy"".  Realized on Wednesday it was open and tried it last night.  Apart will definitely crack into our take out rotation, giving That Little Mexican Cafe an occasional rest. Their pizzas are thin crust and creative.  We went with the Francese (yes, there is egg on the pizza; yes, it is good) and the Capriciosa (a lot of artichokes here - unless you are some kind of freak you won't likely need to ask for extra artichokes).  Both were great.  We also randomly tried the sweet filoncino (chocolate), and liked that, too.  To this layman's eye it seemed like pizza dough filled with a not too sweet chocolate cream and topped with powdered sugar.  What was ordered as a throw in became a highlight.   For $18 we got 2 personal pies, the dessert and two cans of pepsi.  Good deal. Star scoring key: 5 = Spectacular 4 = Better than average, really enjoyed it 3 = Average, don't regret it 2 = Disappointing 1 = Abysmal For more of my reviews see  travelcasserole.blogspot…",0.9888,0.769,0.215,0.016,0.6130555555555556
2007-12-13,4.0,"I really hope this place does well in this space, since several other establishments have not, and the corner could use something besides the Mexican restaurants. Don't get me wrong- I like El Norte, but sometimes I need some variety in my junk food.  Luckily, Apart seems to have a pretty good combination of qualities that might allow it to last for a while. There aren't many other pizza places that do free delivery and are open until 11 PM, as far as I've noticed. Eating there certainly does not come with the ambiance that comes with Spacca Napoli, but on the other hand it's sure not as expensive, and you won't have to wait for a table.  The pizza itself is very good and comes with a lot of nice, quality toppings in a thin-crust, more authentic pizza format. It's not too dry, and is appropriately cheese covered (or not if you don't swing that way).",0.992,0.752,0.248,0.0,0.5756382275132275
2007-11-03,3.0,"This pizza is a great deal! Good thin crust pizza is hard to find on the far north side and this place fits the bill. I still can't get over how cheap their pizzas are - but without sacrificing the quality of their ingredients! We've ordered from them twice now and been happy with the food and service both times. EDIT (12/16): I ran into the same problem Kate did the last time we ordered from here. 75 minutes after ordering and no pizza. We called & they said it would be another 25 minutes. 40 minutes pass - we call again & are told the driver just left. He showed up 10 minutes later. That is way too long to wait for pizza! We were told on the phone that the driver got into a car accident, which wasn't true according to the driver - I think they just lost our order. When the pizza finally got here, it had obviously been reheated and the crust was badly burned. Yuck! They did completely comp our food though, so I'll give them credit for trying to improve their customer service. 2ND EDIT (1/10): I WANT to love you, Apart Pizza. I really do. Your pizza is delicious. But your delivery service is horrible! I never get my pizza in under 2 hours. (I live a short distance away.) That is just sad. Yet I cannot stay away.

2007-08-14,5.0,"This place is SO yummy.  It's real Italian style pizza - hard to find in Chicago!  It's thin crust, made to order, with delicious and fresh ingredients.  Try the Greca.  Actually, do it now.   GO!  It's so good.  You'll thank me. It sucks that Kate had a bad experience but I hope she gives it another shot because the pizza really is fantastic.  I crave this pizza.  Crave it!  It's nice to have a pizza joint in the neighborhood!",0.9674,0.676,0.268,0.056,0.5871212121212122
2007-08-13,4.0,"I love Apart Pizza's Montrose store, so I was so excited when I heard they were coming to my neighborhood.  And I haven't been disappointed.  There seemed to be some problems with the store when it first opened (a few inexperienced staff members, and a few other problems that pop up when a restaurant is new) but everything seemed to sort itself out quickly.   The food is great, the price is extremely affordable, and the guys that work there are helpful and courteous (especially if you happen to be a woman in the 18-40 demographic.) Being a vegetarian I'm overjoyed that there is now a pizza place in my neighborhood that has several menu items that I can eat, and all of my meat eater friends like the rest of the choices on the menu.  If you like feta cheese, you should definitely try the ""Greca"" (the beautiful love-child of thin crust pizza and a Greek salad).  Also great is the Capra-Riccola.  Goat cheese and arugula never tasted so good.",0.9954,0.706,0.275,0.018,0.572041847041847
2007-08-08,4.0,"This is a delicious pizza; thin crust (soft in the middle, crunchy crust), quality ingredients (subtle tomato flavor so the toppings stand out), fresh veggies, enough cheese to pull it all together. This pizza is a good alternative to the cheesy and heavy (albeit savory) flavors of Giordanos, Lou Malunatis, etc. Highly recommend Apart Pizza! We've tried 3 pies - like them all - in order; Cacciatore (the smoked bacon completes this meat pie), Diavola (the peppers were fresh, generous amount of olives), and Greca (the Feta cheese adds a nice punch of flavor to the milder veggies). My husband and I order 2, 8"" pies, and end up with several slices leftover. We also tried the Greek salad with balsamic dressing. It was excellent; crisp lettuce, crunchy peppers and cucumber, generous amounts of olives and feta cheese. I read Kate's review; sympathize with her frustration! We have been to Apart on Broadway for pickup twice. The first time we ordered at the counter. They forgot our salad but had it ready in just a few minutes. The second time we phoned our order in and there was no issue when we picked it up. Both times it has been evident that the staff is new to the business, young, and more eager to chat with the occasional pretty girl who walks by the door than impress the customer. That said, I did find the staff worth the effort. The guys we dealt with, when engaged, were eager to please and brag about their new location. When we left, I told them that we're glad they're in our neighborhood and one of them responded, ""We couldn't be here if not for you. Thank you! Come again"". I'm hoping that Apart continues to hone their business skills like they have their pizza making so that they bring Kate back for another try, more residents in the door, and we have yet another yummy option in our neighborhood.",0.9944,0.805,0.175,0.021,0.4537603305785124
2007-07-17,1.0,"When I recently got a flier from Apart Pizza Company in the mail announcing they had opened a new restaurant in my neighborhood, I was excited. I've heard great things about the other location. However, my experience in trying them out for delivery left me very disappointed.   I called and requested a 14 inch vegetariana pizza, which costs $14.75. I gave the person who answered the phone my name, address, and phone number. I advised the person that I had a $2 off coupon. When I asked for the total, I was told that it was $19.75!  I asked what the delivery fee was and the person on the phone stated that delivery was free.   I asked him to confirm the price of the pizza as $14.95 was correct. He said it was. I then asked if he included the $2 off coupon in the total he gave me. He said he did. I asked him if he was telling me that he was charging $5 in tax for a $12.95 order. He said that was correct. After some further discussion, he concluded he was incorrect and told me the correct total was $14.07. OK, that sounds about right. He told me the pizza would be here within 45 minutes. 75 minutes later, no pizza. I called the restaurant and they said it would be another 20 minutes.  I asked them why would it was taking more than twice as long as I was told (I  live 3 blocks from this place - should have gotten carryout).  I was told that they did not make the pizza because they lost my phone number!!! What?!  That makes no sense. I told them that at this point, it really wasn't worth the hassle and wait and requested to cancel my order. All they said was ""OK..""  If they had done anything to try to make this experience better, I might possibly have given this place another chance, giving them the benefit of the doubt because they are brand new to the neighborhood and maybe they are still working out the kinks. However, between their trying to overcharge me and not even trying to make up for the fact that they didn't complete my order, I highly doubt I will try them again.  Too bad.",0.5209,0.867,0.069,0.063,0.5148693282026615
