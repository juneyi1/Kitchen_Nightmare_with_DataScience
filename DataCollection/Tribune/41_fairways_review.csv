We went in to grab some lunch and watch some football.  $50 got us a chicken club, primerib sandwich, a mimosa and a beer.  The chicken club had nothing to it. It was WAY more bread than anything else. Didnt even seem like a whole chicken breast for the entire sandwich. I was very hungry and left the restaurant still mildly hungry. (You do no get any side btw - we heard a guy get pretty angry at the table behind us.)  The prime rib sandwich was good.

2016-01-02,5.0,"We went here to celebrate New Years Eve 2016 based on a recommendation from a friend, though we had never been there previously. Overall we were very pleased with the decision! It was mostly late 20-mid 30s and was not overly crowded at all. We paid $65 for an early bird ticket and were able to reserve a table for our party at no additional charge, though we had the option of adding bottle service for a fee. Our coats were immediately checked as we were shown to our table.  Passed appetizers started around 8:30 and there was also a buffet dinner that was refreshed periodically throughout the night. I thought everything served was tasty and much higher quality than any other NYE bar food I have had. They served things like crab cakes, flat bread pizzas, chips and guacamole, bbq brisket, shrimp and prosciutto crostini, etc.  Overall, I was most impressed with the drink selection- top shelf liquors were part of the ticket price: Grey Goose Vodka; Titos; Makers Mark Bourbon; Knob Creek Bourbon; Don Julio Tequila; Glenlivet 12yr Whiskey; Hendricks Gin in addition to standard stuff like Captains and Svedka. I drank Moscow Mules and Dark and Stormys all night- and they had real ginger beer (not ginger ale) which made me a very happy customer! I saw many other customers with drinks that are rarely offered for large party events because they are more time consuming or liquor heavy, like manhattans, long islands and old fashioned.  The DJ was also rockin-- he read the room really well. While there was not a defined dance floor per se (and it would have been nice if they turned down house lights once people did start dancing) people definitely got up to dance and they  had consumed more liquid courage. Once the DJ found a genre that the crowd appreciated he played a lot of crowd favorites and his transitions from song to song were spot on. Lastly, it's not on a crazy crowded bar street so it was very easy to catch a cab after the party wound down-- which is a huge plus on NYE nights when you're often fighting with a lot of other people trying to catch a ride.  I would definitely head back to this bar for both drinks with friends and future NYE!",0.9959,0.82,0.168,0.011,0.4565223665223665

2015-10-24,3.0,"This is simply a review of the service*** My friends made reservations for my birthday.  We were a party of 10 (all mid-late 20s) on a Saturday afternoon for the mimosa brunch special.  We had plans to eat and drink, then head up to the golf area. Our server, Michelle, made us feel like we were the biggest burden.  As someone who has been working in the industry for over a decade, I totally understand that Saturday morning shifts aren't always fun and large parties of mainly women are always hit or miss...I get it! However, this is an industry where you need to fake it sometimes.  We were very tame and trying to celebrate a birthday.  Michelle was very curt and made no effort to go above and beyond her basic serving role (my drink was always full, and I never had to ask for more water).  We asked for 1 round of shots and decided to go with Vegas Bombs, she asked how to make them so we told her, but said that the bartender would probably know.  She responded with a condescending tone, ""oh I mean we just don't get many bombs"". Ok, I know these shots aren't great but the least you can do as a server is to go talk bad about me to the bartender or the other servers and pretend to enjoy my patronage while I'm sitting in your section.  Shortly after this and after several other backhanded comments I made the decision to get out of there as quickly as possible. I don't require much to enjoy a dining experience, and it really takes a lot for me to be upset about my service.  I made sure everyone still tipped 20%, because I'm not a monster. However, Michelle could have made a lot more money because we were planning on staying there for quite some time.  I will say- the hostess this morning (Oct 17th,2015) was fantastic.  Very personable!",0.8718,0.844,0.092,0.063,0.4762562003968254

I ordered the cowboy skirt steak, which comes with an egg, skirt steak and gravy and fried tortilla with guacamole. The skirt steak was very tender and the gravy was more dark and savory than traditional gravy, and both were delicious. The remainder of the dish was decent, but it was balanced enough for the flavors of the steak.  I also was able to try the chicken and waffles, which were great--crunchy, juicy and a little sweet but in a pleasant way. We also had French fries with the bone marrow dip. I found the dip to be strange and more of an acquired taste but our companions enjoyed it. The mimosas themselves were good, and it seemed like they used freshly squeezed orange juice. It's definitely a good deal for Sunday brunch! There is also an indoor golf simulator on the top floor, which you can actually test out for free. It's about $70 per hour, so I would suggest bringing a group to get the best value. The servers were attentive, especially when refilling drinks, and they were fast as well.

We came here to watch the Blackhawks the other night, they won so that's always a plus! First of all, I give this place 5 stars for TV's and watching a sports game. There's massive TV's everywhere, they play the sound too during the game and cut to music during commercial breaks. Overall great place to watch games. We had reservations and were seated right away which was also good. Where does it fall short? Well.. I'd say food and service. After we ordered some drinks and apps, we didn't see our waitress for almost 20 minutes, even though we wanted to order dinner. Finally we order dinner, and almost 1 hour later it comes out. Whatever, they seemed understaffed and they were super busy for the Hawks game. The food comes out, and its pretty large portions (see picture), but why the hell are they on tiny wood square plates with no lips? Now we have sauce and salad dressing dripping over the side of the wood block onto the table making a mess.. The burger was way too smokey and the bottom of the bun honestly felt like it was dipped in water before they served it, that's how soggy it was. I get it, buns get soggy. But right out of the kitchen? Come on. Then we had to wait 5 minutes to get knifes, no big deal, but kind of annoying.  My smoked brisket slabwich was falling off the plate everywhere because again, it's a small wooden block. The brisket was dry and wasn't that good unless it was smothered in the bbq sauce. The side salad was good though.

I coordinated everything with Mark back in January. I am not the easiest person to deal with when it comes to contracts/reservations because I've had some bad experiences in the past. I must have asked 30 questions via e-mail and Mark was always quick to reply back and explain things for me in further detail.  We rented out the entire top floor so that everyone could play golf and hang out. Mark was very attentive and even let us bring in our own cake the morning of the party. There was a small misunderstanding on my part from the contract when it came to payment and Mark was the first to compromise with me to ensure that it didn't ruin the party. From small things like having him send a ""fake"" tee time confirmation to my boyfriend, to letting us stay past the time proposed on the contract Fairways blew my expectation away.  Side note: our bartender Ryan was amazing!!! Knew how to make the best drinks and was so fast in making sure everyone's order was put in and taken care of.

Thank god for indoor golf simulators or else he would go nuts lol.  I made a reservation for two of the four simulators for my husband and a bunch of his friends to celebrate his bday. When we arrived (about an hour early), I believe it was the manager, who asked us if we really needed both simulators...said there were guys waiting for one to open. Well at the moment we only had four guys (still enough for two simulators, and me and another girl were willing to play until the rest showed up). The rest were running late so my husband felt pressured to cancel one of them, so he did. Should have stuck with what our reservation was for. Well, we had dinner downstairs to kill time-food was good! Def recommend the tacos and the bbq chicken flatbread.  After dinner we went upstairs to play. It gets pretty crammed in the area..but there are couches, tables and a few chairs for those (us girls) not playing. There's also a bar and a server. Had to take off a star because the service upstairs was soooo slow. We were always looking for the bartender/server. Anyways, more guys showed up, had about 12 total, and of course we wished we hadn't given up that second simulator Took off another star for being pressured to give up a simulator :( It was still fun though, the simulators were the best ones I've seen.

This place was great because: - The golf simulators seemed true to real golf. I've been to other simulators that are not quite right. These are the best I've ever used by leaps and bounds. - They provide nice clubs for you to use. - They provide a fridge of beer at each bay to help yourself to. No waiting for a drink order! The take inventory at the end and just tack it onto your bill. - The food was surprisingly good. I would go just for that. Think upscale bar food. - The service was fantastic. Very attentive servers. - The prices are super reasonable, even during peak weekend hours. 7 guys split 2 golf bays, ordered 6 apps to share, drank nonstop for 2 hours and we came in just under $325. Split that 7 ways, it's a great way to spend a few hours. Overall, It's just a unique experience that you should do at least once. Even if you don't play real golf, try it. It's just a good time.

Our waitress was always there when we needed anything and was knowledgable and helpful when answering questions about drinks and food.

The french dip sandwich was delicious, except that the dip itself was a bit on the salty side. But overall, very pleased with the food. Definitely well-above-average bar food.  I'd come back (or at least recommend it to friends in the neighborhood), and if it's usually not too crowded on the weekends downstairs, it'd be a great place to bring a group of friends.

2014-09-06,2.0,"Went here on a Friday night around 7pm because the burger and fries come recommended by Timeout Chicago. To be honest, I have no idea how this burger made it on the list. I'd much rather bring my own beer and head to the Butcher & the Burger down the street.  To start, there was only one other table in the whole place. When we asked the server if the place had recently opened, she noted that they've been open since December! If they don't get more people in the place soon, I don't see this place sticking around. There were no Friday specials (at least not that we were told about) and the drinks were on the higher end, with basic cocktails starting at $10 and nicer ones being around $12. I had a moscow mule that was fairly standard - I've had better, I've had worse but it wasn't really worth $10.  I ordered the Fairways burger and fries and was sadly disappointed. The meat was bland and the overall burger fairly tasteless, despite the fried onions, cheddar cheese, and tomato jam. There was a hint of tomato jam taste, but the fried onions didn't taste very fresh and the cheddar cheese was basically invisible under the jam. The burger was overcooked for my medium-rare order. There's too many other good burger places in this city to waste time and money eating a burger here.  The service, however, was excellent. Our server was very cheerful and did a good job of answering our questions about the drink options. The decor was impressive - very chic with big bay windows at the front that I think might open up during the summer months.

Even with the dipping sauces (the whitish one was congealed a bit, which was off putting), we couldn't eat them. The drinks were super watery, even the mead came with ice (in my limited experience, I've never had mead with ice), and neither tasted good.

Service was splendid from the get-go, as they e-mailed me back promptly about my reservation and was super friendly. I even called to let them know about running 10 minutes late and they did not have a problem and were very welcoming. We shared the shrimp diablo which was very good. Shrimp was perfectly cooked and tasty. The shiitake mushroom flatbread was also pretty good. Obviously, a little pricy and not huge portions, but was reasonable for this type of place. I had the No Island drink and it was pretty good. Could have been a tad stronger in alcohol, but by no means was it weak. My only qualm was there was only one lady covering the whole upstairs.

Came here for the Super Bowl with high hopes as this was our first time here. The hostess told us the bar was open seating and while we were looking around she then said one part of the dining area was open too.  We ended up sitting at the bar and the two bartenders were attentive but sort of dismissive. One told us SOME of the drink specials. Then handed us drink menus. Good thing I looked at the website online earlier or I wouldn't have known about the $3 coronas. Don't have drink specials if you don't really want to advertise them... Or train your staff to tell the specials in entirety. We had to ask for food menus. The three of us started with beers and ordered food later on. We got 2 orders of nachos, one plate looked pathetic compared to the other, it had so little toppings and on both orders the cheese was dried so they had obviously been sitting in the kitchen waiting for someone to deliver them. We didn't complain because by that point we had decided we would leave at half time because of the following: The managers, or 3 men who seemed like managers were walking around talking to their friends  There was only one bartender by the time the game started. She did a good job but servers kept crowding around the bar waiting for their drinks and we noticed they basically were standing around talking to each other when they could have been checking on other tables.  The 2nd bartender from earlier sat next to us with her friends when her shift was apparently over. The chef came out from the kitchen numerous times and he should have either noticed our crappy nachos or spent more time overseeing what his cooks were sending out.  Two of the three of us are food and beverage managers in the city and we were just very disappointed with the chain of events. We observed a lot of unprofessionalism.

Your website says you guys are open: Monday - Thursday  |  5:00pm - Close. WTF does that mean? You guys took a tee time reservation for 2 hours at 9:30pm.

If you don't have the money to run a place like this with set rules, then don't open it at all. Either that or just say you're closing earlier so you can minimize your losses. Good luck staying open.

The golf theme is consistent--from the menu to the decor. The only missing element was a beer cart girl or the wait staff dressing like caddies.

Six of us purchased the VIP tickets for 125/ticket, which included passed apps, premium cocktails, champagne toast, and access to the golf simulators. The group was pretty excited and given that the guys in our group are avid golfers, they were pretty excited to have gained this wintertime respite. However, we won't be returning. Our waitress was pretty nice and attentive so we don't fault her. I do however fault management. When purchasing our tickets the advertisement specifically said premium cocktails. When we were seated we were informed that our package included well drinks. At 125 ticket and given the place was empty we felt very taken advantage of. When she first told us this I chalked it up to not reading the advertisement closely. as the night proceeded and we drank this disgusting cheap wine that's already giving us a headache (there was only 2-3 types of wine available with our package and since none of us wanted well, we basically were drinking what I assume cost the bar 3 dollars a glass). The boys were drinking miller lite despite the fact they assumed they'd be able to have jack and cokes. As no one was buzzed by 1030 and the fact that we'd received 3 of the 10 apps advertised on their Facebook page that night, I decided to check my email and see did it actually say well alcohol?  Lo and behold it does say premium cocktails. As the waitress explained it meant ""premium well"" I asked to see manager. As we googled premium well as an industry term we came up short - premium cocktails means, jack, ketel, grey goose, captains , etc.  the manager came to our table and I explained our disappointment. He was very nice and while he explained that it meant premium well, he would honor our expectation and allow us to have premium cocktails   While I certainly appreciate the customer service, I didn't like the situation it put us in and I'm sure there were many other patrons disappointed.  Not only that we spent almost three hours of our five hour package drinking well. After all that the men we were with started ordering jack and cokes they were disappointingly served Jim bean, but after all the haggling decided not to argue. Then we decided to order a bottle of veuve cliquot - it's nye - knowingly at 110/bottle.  When the waitress returned we were informed they were out of stock of all champagne. On nye?  How does that happen?  Fine. The music shut off right around midnight leading to a less than celebratory atmosphere amongst the 20 people in the upstairs. We were served a champagne gelatin that was inedible. Then promptly at 130 we were told to leave the simulator because the owners' family was there. Awesome. Despite it being a nonstandard night, this experience left such a bad taste in our mouths we won't be hurrying back.  I will say the decor is nice and the simulator was fun - hence the two stars.

The golf simulators are cool and the restaurant provides good golf clubs for you to use.  Each simulator even has its own refrigerator stocked with beer so that you can self-serve.  The food was good but not great. Finally, the staff was very friendly and attentive.  There is one big problem with the golf simulation area that should probably be addressed sooner rather than later. The area, which houses 4 simulators and a bunch of couches and chairs, is too compact to accommodate the current setup. Patrons and employees often have to walk directly behind golfers in the act of swinging in order to exit the simulation area. If either the golfer or the person walking behind the golfer are not paying close attention this could easily result in some lost teeth or a giant bruise on the head. Even if they are paying attention, the person trying to exit the area must delay his departure until the golfer finishes his shot. Kind of irritating.  Overall, Fairways was a fun experience. I just hope they heed my advice and alter the setup of the simulator area before someone takes a RBZ right to the chin. 1/26/14 Addendum:  I went to Fairways again last night for a friend's farewell party.  She's moving to Tampa Bay.  Can't blame her,  given that the high temperature tomorrow is projected to be -6 degrees here in Chicago.  In any event, I was happy to see that Fairways addressed the safety problems in the golf simulator area.  I still think the furniture setup could be better.  There has to be a way to route people entering and exiting the area towards the middle of the room rather than through an aisle that separates the simulator and the chairs for the group of people at the simulator.  In other words, ideally Fairways will figure out a way for patrons and employees to enter and exit *behind* a group's chairs instead of in front of them.  It takes away from the experience if you get assigned to one of the simulators closest to the entrance/exit and you have patrons and employees constantly shuffling through in front of you.",0.9752,0.835,0.114,0.051,0.5454761904761904
