2016-08-24,5.0,"We stumbled here after being given the run around at another restaurant just down the street.  SO glad we did!! We had driven from the burbs to meet another couple to go to a BYOB dinner.  We were all dressed up,  had our wine, we even had a reservation (at a different restaurant) and we were ready to EAT and spend money!  Al saw us walking down the street looking kind of lost and asked if we had a reservation.  ""not here"", we all kind of laughed, and told him about the nonsense that Las Tablas had just put us through across the street. He immediately made us feel at home.  He moved around reservations and sat us immediately.  Tahvia, our server, was there instantly with waters and wine openers/glasses. Another server was there with bread (precut and served resting on a layer of olive oil and parm cheese). Tahvia was wonderful at making suggestions, pouring drinks and being delightful the entire evening.  It is a rather small, no, quaint place.  Small would sound like I meant crowded and that it is not.  The portions are generous and the food is delicious! We hada few apps which we all shared.   Mushroom tartlett: variety of mushrooms on a puff pastry with mild cheese sauce on the side Baked Brie with points, two jams, walnuts and grapes Entrees: My friend and i split lamb gnocchi. Served in a terrine and almost stewlike with diced carrots and peas.  Still had some leftover. Mussels in a wonderful broth with shrimp and andouille sausage (again SO much food!) Steak Frites: perfectly cooked new York Strip with just seasoned french fries.

2016-08-22,1.0,"I never write negative Yelp reviews. I work in search engine marketing and know how damaging they are to local businesses. That said, our dining experience at Bistro Dre was such a breathtaking fiasco that I have to make an exception. That evening, my girlfriend and I had tickets to an 8 PM show at the Athenaeum theater & decided to eat an early dinner. We chose Bistro Dre. The place was empty at 6 PM, so we got a table right away. 2 hours is more than enough to have a relaxed dinner, right?  (...right?!) 6:00. Bistro Dre is BYOB so the server directed me to a ""liquor store"" a block and a 1/2 south. I left my girlfriend to peruse the menu & ventured into the heat for a bottle of wine. I walked a block and a half. Then walked 2 blocks. Then walked some more. 20 minutes and a bucket of sweat later, no sign of a liquor store.  Hot and flustered, I returned to the restaurant empty-handed. Where was this place, again? ""Oh,"" said the server. ""It's a bar. They sell 'package deals.'"" 'Package deals,' huh? OK. I went out a second time to a dive bar down the street and, sure enough, they sell wine by the bottle to restaurant patrons. I had to wait an eternity for the barkeep to fetch it from the dungeon. 6:15. Before I left the second time, we placed our order & the server upsold us into a grapefruit salad. Why not? Grapefruit sounded good on a hot night.  6:30 In the space of 5 minutes, the place filled up like a tank of piranhas. Our server disappeared into the morass.  6:55. 25 minutes later, our salad arrived. It had two anemic grapefruit slices and was riddled with cubes of tasteless watermelon. No dressing. No sign of our entrees. At that point, we were starving so we horfed the whole thing. 7:15 - 7:30. Guests who arrived 45 minutes after we did finished their meals. My girlfriend and I could tell something was wrong, but still enjoyed ourselves. Until 7:30 came and went, that is. Still no sign of our entrees or our server -- she forgot us or went into hiding. Or both.  Finally we flagged her down. We're on a schedule, we said. She looked like she'd seen a ghost. ""Let me see what I can do,"" she whispered and disappeared. Again. 7:50 PM -- 10 minutes to showtime.  20 more minutes went by. Though we were hungry & half-drunk after sharing a bottle of wine with nothing but an anemic watermelon salad, we canceled our order. I found the server & delivered the news and my credit card. I've never canceled a dinner order at a restaurant in my life.  The second I sat back down -- of course -- an older woman appeared with our dinners. They looked delicious. I politely turned her away. On the lady's heels, like ballet, our server arrived with our bill for the small salad. The bill was for $17.  She rung it up with incredible speed. 7:55 PM. As we prepared to go, an older gentleman appeared at the table -- the owner, Mr. Bistro Dre himself. ""You realize when you have tickets to a show, you need to show up to the restaurant a few minutes early, right?"" he said.  My girlfriend and I blinked. ""We've been here for almost two hours,"" she said.  He appeared confused. ""The waitress said you were here for 24 minutes?"" then went on to throw his server under the bus, accused her of incompetence and of lying to him. She was standing right behind him and heard every word. (It was obvious she had said no such thing.) ""The food looks great,"" I said. ""We're just out of time."" He softened a bit when he saw we weren't that upset. ""OK, here's what I'm gonna do..."" he said with a magnanimous air and offered to comp the salad. ""She already rang up the card?"" said my girlfriend. The implication was clear.  ""Oh,"" Mr Bistro Dre shrugged, missing the cue. ""OK.  Well... we'll see you again!""  He gave a wan smile and lumbered off.  *** Why am I writing all of this? Mostly for a laugh, but also for a few serious reasons: 1. My girlfriend was a chef and I worked in the service industry for years. A manager should NEVER berate staff in front of patrons. At best, it makes you look like a lousy boss. Mostly it makes you look like a schmuck. Did the server cock up our order? Yes. Did she deserve to be humiliated by her boss for that in front of the customers? No -- a thousand times, no.  2. Though our server made some mistakes, she knew how to operate a credit card machine. Mr. Bistro Dre apparently does not. That we were charged $17 for a salad and a nonexistent meal isn't just appalling. It's funny! 3. I'm aware it's wise to eat early before a show -- that's what we attempted to do. Pro tip, Mr. Bistro: don't insult the intelligence of your patrons, esp. patrons that have received bad service & are being good sports about it. It leads to reviews like this. 4. We hope our poor server finds a better job. There are plenty of other places to wait tables in town. Life is too short to work for such a crappy boss.  So no, Mr. Bistro, you won't see us again. Unless it's at a bistro in Hell. You're off to a great start. :)",0.9217,0.788,0.105,0.107,0.47081298331298327
2016-08-22,1.0,"Food on point, service well beyond subpar. We went for brunch on Sunday. I'd made a reservation ahead of time, but there were still some open tables around. Relatively small place overall. BYOB, but CASH ONLY.  We were seated right away, but then we were just in limbo for over 5 minutes. We had empty glasses, 3 bottles of champagne, and contemplated what to do. After 5+ mins, the waitress came around and asked if the other server had come by.. obv not so she said she would be ours. Filled us up with water and then disappeared again for 5+ mins. Came back with ice bucket and champagne glasses. We asked for OJ and she disappeared again for 10 mins. We flagged down the other waiter and asked for a small glass of OJ. FINALLY after 20+ mins of being there we could start drinking! Unfortunately, they bring the OJ in a small glass which makes it IMPOSSIBLE to pour into champagne glasses. Please invest in small carafes Bistro Dre. I'd read about getting free banana bread when you sit down, we waited plenty and got nothing. The table next to us got service and banana bread within 5 minutes. WTF? What's up with the inconsistency? For food, we ordered croissant with nutella and fresh berries and a variety of dishes (Caprese Benedict, Smokes Salmon Benedict, Chicken and Waffles, and Salmon Hash). The Nutella croissant was amazing. Perfect way to start (or end) the meal. My Chicken and waffles was alright. Half a waffle and 2 pieces of chicken. The crispy skin would not stick to the chicken so by the time i was done with half, half the plate was filled with breading. The benedicts got great reviews from the table. The hash was meh. One of the benedicts and the hash both came with WAY overcooked poached eggs. The yolk was completely cooked. We asked for more eggs, which they brought on the side. But common, if you're going to serve brunch at least make your poached eggs correctly.  I had intentionally left my second half for leftovers. Asked our server to pack it. She brought the check and I asked about the leftovers and her response was ""oops"". Again, WTF?  Overall, we were very very disappointed with the service. The service was ridiculously slow (they were NOT that busy), we had to wait 20+ mins just to start drinking our mimosas, we weren't given the complementary banana bread, and they threw away my leftovers that i'd asked to pack. We will not be returning.",0.8114,0.847,0.085,0.069,0.5367813051146384
2016-08-21,4.0,"Best peach pie EVAR. But let's get something out of the way from the start. Don't go to this wonderful, quaint BYOB gem with an attitude or in a hurry. They are NOT your mama! Be smart. Plan ahead. And take a few bottles of decent pinot noir and un-oaked white of some sort because Chef Andre has really come a very long way since their humble beginnings.  See, we've loved this spot for so long... way back when it was the former Las Tablas property. Yeah. Long time ago. And Bistro Dre has really turned this into one of the best casual bistro styled restaurants Chicago's seen. But let's talk about that food! When Bistro Dre first opened we were naturally excited to have anyone try French styles with a BYOB policy.  While we appreciated the fried chicken waffles and mac n cheese dishes back then, it's what Chef is doing these days that strikes an incredible contrast to those earlier menu items. Check out the pics! Peach pie:  Luckily we ordered a few lighter dishes that made it possible to devour not only the best peach pie I've ever masticated, but maybe on of the best pie a la modes had in recent times. Savory, flakey crust. Fresh, exceptional peach slices that are certainly not from that industrial sized can of cling that the local elementary is slinging. is that creamy, slightly vanilla ice cream home made, hand cranked? Damn near wriggled out of my seat from a powerful mouthgasm, virtually hitting the 3ft tall spoon and fork hanging by the front door. Good gawwwdh. :o Asparagus ravioli: Unfortunately we showed up very late in the evening and missed both the lamb gnocchi and fried chicken offerings but maybe we won because this dish would put MANY of Chicago's 9,874 italian-theme restaurants to utter shame. The pasta was super delicate, fresh and the asparagus flavors so beautiful spring like and green. The chopped bits of whole kernel corn in the broth were just the touch. What a wonderful dish and it certainly went well with our pinot noir and unoaked chardonnay. Bacon crusted whitefish with quinoa: People who truly know me understand that I gave up pork back in 1991. However, reality dictates that most French styled restaurants like many Chinese places will definitely be quite heavy on the bacon fat, etc. I eat massive quantities of delicious fish and Chef Andre really knocked this dish out of the park. Grand slam. Everything came together. Super crispy, buttery crust while keeping the white meat tender and flavorful. Chopped fresh green onion really helped express the dish's elegance. Not big and bold but delicate ambrosia, for sure. Spinach and apple salad with baked goat cheese: Honestly, I wanted to slap my friend for coming along with me to a French restaurant and pushing hard order a damn salad. Insulted. But damn he was right on the mark with that call. Bistro Dre trotted out a tub of delicious spinach, bordered by almost Bosc pear like apple sliced lightly drizzled with tasty balsamic and that soft, pillowy puck of goat cheese just scattered a tasty universe of flavor, flanked by candied pecan and cranberry. What a salad! Wanted to lick the bowl. I feel quite ashamed for not leaving the south side as much as I used to after encountering such fantastic meals like this one. :D",0.999,0.716,0.229,0.056,0.5333564045773348
2016-08-16,5.0,"Plate-licking delicious! As we had been snacking at the Cubs game and could only get an early dinner reservation, our party of 4 ordered 3 starters to share.  - Roasted Beet Stuffed Beets, aka ""Beets by Dre"": Whimsical name aside, the flavors of this dish are out of this world. It was umami-intense with the balsamic and pistachio pesto, and the meaty beets were the perfect vehicle for the awesome sauce.  - Mushroom Tart: The tart is a puff-pastry rather than a pastry base with a filling. But the mushrooms were so earthy and nutty from the truffle oil and herbs. The brie fondue was served in a gravy boat so that you can control your cheese intake. - Scottish Potato Pancakes: The pancakes tasted like mom's cooking, with a dense center and crispy exterior. The capers, caviar, and creme fraiche were the perfect layers on top that provided salty and creamy contrasts.  We also shared the key lime pie and the triple chocolate fudge cake, which were SO decadent. Both are served with ice cream (mango sorbet with the key lime pie and chocolate ice cream with the latter) and generous heaping of whipped cream and fudge.

There wasn't a morsel of food left on any of the plates.   We were so full we couldn't handle any dessert although it looked good! Ambiance:  The restaurant is small but very conversant friendly. It is decorated in a country French theme and is very cozy.  We were thrilled that we didn't have to shout to be heard. We found the surroundings were very inviting and appreciate that it was not over the top glitzy as many restaurants tend to lean towards and charge you appropriately for it.  It had a a charming neighborhood feel so we felt relaxed and dined at a leisurely pace even though it was completely filled on a week night. Service:  We started with one waitress/hostess who was very friendly and helpful and then transitioned to another person who waited on the table.  The second person did not appear to be in a good mood and wore a scowl throughout the service and seemed to be annoyed when she learned the first waitress already explained the options.  However, she she did handle her responsibilities but we didn't feel she was very approachable.  This is the only reason I gave the rating a 4 star.   Overall, it was a great dining experience and we would definitely go back.

2016-08-03,2.0,"Wasn't super impressed with this place. The Mac n cheese lacked in flavor, needed salt, and the cheese sauce had a grainy/floury texture. It also comes with a $17.50 price tag which is a little crazy for how bad it was. For 17.50 I had high expectations. The steak in the steak frites was over-charred and had a very bitter flavor. The parsley butter on top had an overpowering parsley taste and texture with little salt. I would say overall the dishes are lacking flavor and salt. The rhubarb strawberry pie dessert was delicious, but they left the ice cream out which was a huge bummer. I know I got the dessert to go, but a warning would have been nice to set expectations. Service was slow and inattentive for an non busy weekday.  If you're looking for good upper-scale American/bistro food in a casual setting I'd head down the street to Farm Bar which in my opinion is better not to mention cheaper.

2016-07-07,2.0,"I had very mixed feelings about this brunch, on one hand it's BYOB, but on the other hand the food and service were just not there.  We went over a holiday weekend so it's possible that their normal staff was off that day or they were shorter staffed than normal but there was only one waiter and he seemed very confused, he spent most of the meal eating his own food in the back of the restaurant and didn't know how to handle the fact that we kept asking for a little more time to look over the menu as we were catching up and chatting. I ended up ordering the quinoa hash and here's where things started to get strange. I clarified that as I was ordering it gluten free it would not come with the breakfast pastry and the waiter agreed. However when I did get my meal there were clearly cornbread crumbs on one side of the plate as if it had been put on and then removed. Now this is not a huge deal but I was annoyed that I had to basically avoid an entire section of my dish in case there were crumb but I didn't want to send something back at this point. Another weird thing was that one of the poached eggs had been way overcooked and was essentially hard boiled. Again, not the worst thing but not what I was expecting. The worst thing was definitely finding a hair in my food, it was small and curly and 100 percent what you do not want to see in your breakfast. I flagged over the waiter and sent it back and he still seemed confused. At least when I got it back the crumbs and hard boiled egg were gone! Although the yummy roasted potato slices had been replaced by soggy French fries in the second iteration of the dish so not sure what that was about.  Overall I liked that it's BYOB but after a brunch that was more uncomfortable than anything else I don't think I'll be back.",0.9359,0.808,0.107,0.085,0.5335138888888888
2016-06-16,2.0,"Judging from reviews, the food was supposed to be stellar. My fiancee and I chose this place for our 5 year anniversary. I ordered the Steak of the Day and she chose the Steak and Frites. The reviews on yelp all complement the steak very highly and we couldnt pick just one. I terribly regret our decision. We both ordered medium, they both came back well done; virtually no pink meat whatsoever. Both steaks were mostly gristle. Her steak was at least one cut of meat, my steak came in 3 separate parts, and all of them were about 60% inedible. I suspect the restaurant ran out of steaks and gave us the last bits of meat they had left over, hence they were overcooked in an attempt to hide flaws? Thats the best case scenario. In either case, by the time I had finished, I think the majority of the ""steak"" was still on my plate from all the gristle I refused to eat. I would have much rather been told they don't have any good cuts of steak left than be served left over and over cooked cuts. They also have the nerve to charge an upcharge for ordering steak during the prix fixe menu (despite the sign up front saying ANY entree for $25, with the ANY being underlined). I had no problem with this when I was expecting a great cut of meat cooked to order, I think I'd have enjoyed a steak at outback more.  Credit where its due, the wine sauce on the steak of the day was great.  The service was also very good, the woman who served us did a great job answering questions and was very polite. The desserts were also great. Key lime pie and angel food cake were both awesome. They get 2 stars only because there were at least some redeeming qualities, had the main course been good (or even, edible) this would easily been a 4 if not 5 star experience. Maybe we were there on an off day, but I certainly was not getting the same steak as all the other yelp reviews.",0.7641,0.859,0.071,0.07,0.4915224089635855

Our server was polite, friendly and helpful and talked us through the menu as it was our first visit. We had the onion soup, the lobster bisque, poutine and the lamb empanadas. The food was ok but nothing to write home about - it definitely isn't enough to keep us going back. Price wise, I thought Bistro Dre was on the high side, and given the fact that there is plenty of competition in the area, I don't really think it can be justified. On a side note, the bathrooms were a bit of a shambles. They were not overly clean and are basically used as storage rooms with toilet paper and kid's high chairs stacked up. There was also a stack of magazines by the toilet - how long do they expect you to be in there? Overall it was ok, but there are far better options around.",0.9664,0.841,0.143,0.016,0.4451111111111111

The server was so off. We had finished the Brie and I was enjoying the chutneys. The server just came and picked up the plate. Didn't even ask if you are done, you need anything.

It was incredible, all types of good stuff in there and why this restaurant has a Canadian feel. The atmosphere is pretty loud and great for a big group, also a BYOB.

2016-04-14,2.0,"Our last visit to bistro dre was just not good. We've been there before a few years back and really enjoyed it, however this latest visit was much different. We had a reservation and were sat promptly. On a Wednesday night, the place started to fill up fairly quickly, but for some reason there were only two servers. This caused an obvious problem as service suffered. We brought our own bottle of wine and it took 15 mins for them to open it. Waters were never filled once despite empty glasses remaining on the table, and there was not much interaction with our server. Rightfully so since she was responsible for about 6 other tables at the same time. Now onto the food.. Bland and not worth finishing. We did their special for three courses, I ordered the lobster bisque and it was fine. Nothing I would crave again. My friend ordered the French onion soup and didn't come close to finishing it, saying it was too sweet. We both got the fried chicken and waffles ... Zero flavor. It was as if there was no seasoning added, just chicken and fried breading. Lastly, we ended with the chocolate cake that came with a raspberry sauce and scoop of ice cream. Took one bite, and it was dry and not a good combination of flavors. Definitely not worth the calories and I am not one to ever pass up chocolate cake. Super disappointed about this place and probably won't be returning given all the other amazing restaurant options in the area.",0.939,0.793,0.127,0.08,0.5214635854341736

The first time that I dined there I had the Brunch Poutine.  This was a ton of food between the fries, eggs, bacon and gravy.  My only criticism was that it was a little on the salty side.  Also, out of the blue, our server came out with an order of nutella crepes for the table because the chef was working on perfecting them, and told us that they were on the house!  They were definitely a highlight, as they bananas and nutella went very well together. The second time I went I ordered the Brisket Burger and was very impressed.  The egg on the burger was cooked just right to run all over the plate when I bit into it.  I've had many brunch burgers in which the egg was overcooked and the yolk was dry.   My only issue is that the service tends to get a little slow at times, especially if you are sitting by the windows (aka trapped in the corner) and away from the main walking areas of the servers.  I tend to drink coffee like it's going out of style, and I kept having to flag down our server for refills.

He said some rude stuff right off the bat and then continued to be rude. I quickly realized that he was joking around and I joked back with him. By the end we got along really well; however, I wasn't expecting Ed Debevic's style of service. I didn't realize that was part of the Bistro Dre experience and it seemed as if the table next to us wasn't as tickled as I was. They had sour facial expressions and seemed annoyed with the timeliness of service and I felt badly for them. Secondly, we didn't like the food. The cheese and charcuterie board was alright but nothing special. We loved the salads and I heard that the ravioli was good from my friend. My fish was a beautiful texture and an interesting presentation; however, it was too salty for me. Everybody tried it and agreed that it was good, but too salty. I also ate some fried chicken and macaroni and cheese and did not like either one. We got two crème brulees and one berry pie for dessert. The crème brulee was too eggy and the server said that it was a preference in preparation. Okay. Well. Nobody liked it and they were a waste of money. We all liked the berry pie. The atmosphere at Bistro Dre was boisterous with lots of things hanging on the walls and ceiling. There was so much that caught my eye.

The restaurant is BYOB, which is in my opinion, the best kind of ""drink special"".  The space has a lot of character; from the quirky wall décor to the charismatic servers.  Also, note that brunch is CASH ONLY. I didn't find this out until we were already seated, but there's a Chase right across the street. While dinner is served as shared plates, brunch is individual. The portions weren't overwhelming, and I think everyone was more than satisfied after their meal.  As somewhat of a chicken and waffles connoisseur (lol), I had to order them when the server mentioned that they were a ""fan favorite"", which they even offer on their dinner menu. My other friends got the Shrimp & Grits, Poutine, and the Crab Cake Benedict. The menu we had was slightly different from what is online.  The chicken and waffles were phenomenal. I just got butterflies thinking about them. They may have been the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. I don't know what it was about the waffle they served, but I almost requested a second one before I realized I was too full to even speak. It was literally perfection. Two of my other friends also ordered the same thing, and were equally pleased. My friend who got the shrimp & grits expressed that the sausage in the dish was incredible.  Our bill was $98.

However  on both occasions ( at an interval of about 3 months) my companion ordered the steak and it didn't taste good. It was cooked okay, but the cut of meat or whatever is not good tasting. I had fish both times and it was well prepared and tasted good: whitefish once, salmon the last time. Get the lobster bisque. It is luscious.  The charcuterie platter ( not part of the price fixe dinner) vastly improved. Desserts are limited, more American than French. The cheesecake sparked a spirited discussion about the different styles of cheesecake. They are very accommodating about BYOB.

Give him the benefit of the doubt. We were going to have a good time no matter what.  She ordered the steak of the day. I ordered the shrimp scampi. When the food arrived they brought the wrong steak. No big deal. She said she'd eat it, but the waiter insisted he bring her the right steak. The guy was earning points until he brought her the same steak (the cut was exactly the same and it took about five minutes to fix. I'm also a general manager at a restaurant) which they covered in an obviously pre-made gravy and a few handfuls of blue cheese. The shrimp scampi was edible but unmemorable.  The waiter ignored us the rest of the meal until it looked like we were ready for the check. I realize this is BYOB, but I've waited tables for years and I always pour a tables wine. I also asked them if the food is good. He seemed thankful we were leaving.  At the end I went to the bathroom and had to dodge baby chairs, a changing table, and random stuff I won't mention. It was clean, I'll give them that. But there's a difference between homey and someone's home. This place leaned toward the latter. I won't be returning. I can say my curiosity has been satisfied.",0.9652,0.823,0.122,0.055,0.44169772256728773
2015-08-05,2.0,"It pains me to write this review because I've had many great meals at Bistro Dre. However, one horrendous service experience has marred my opinion of this establishment. I live in the neighborhood so have frequented Bistro Dre about ten times. The last visit was for brunch back in June. Our server, Nathan, who also turned out to be the manager was incredibly flippant and unapologetic for the mishaps of our meal.  The trouble started when we were ordering. There was no way to describe Nathan other than rude and disengaged. He honestly acted annoyed with the questions we had about the menu and my husband's request for crispy bacon. I could look past this, but then the first two brunch dishes arrived for our party of 4. These dishes were fine, but what was not fine was the absence of the dishes for my mom and I. After a few inquiries the other two dishes arrived 15 minutes later, after our dining companions are all but finished eating. Also, a table that had come in and ordered ten minutes after us received their food before my mom and I did! What's up with that?  When I asked why our table's food was served so far apart, the answer I received from Nathan was that ""dishes came out as soon as they were ready"", which is totally fine when true. However, this excuse made no sense because both of the late dishes came out cold! My mom's dish was totally inedible as the creamy sauce had gotten gummy and hard since it was not served hot. Everything on the plate was slathered in the sauce so no opportunity to eat around it. This dish (couch potato pancakes) is delicious if served hot so mom was super disappointed. When I asked to speak with a manager I was surprised that our server was apparently the manager too (because he was so dismissive and uncaring about our experience). Typically managers want to make things right! There was no apology or offer to correct the inadequacies. Nathan was actually defensive when I expressed our discontent! He blamed the food taking long and not being served together on a big party (maybe 10-12 girls) that was the ONLY other table in the restaurant when we arrived. Um, if you can't handle three tables during brunch then what do you do during Saturday night dinner rush!? Nathan did give us 10% off of our bill, but this was not a sufficient remedy considering one of the meals was untouched and the amount of time we spent there waiting. Totally disappointed with how Bistro Dre handled our subpar experience. Bistro Dre - Please help yourself out and hire a more professional day manager who actually understands the value of superior customer service!",0.9758,0.809,0.118,0.073,0.4813809523809524

2015-03-01,1.0,"First off, these are not small plates.  We ordered the roasted beet (Just blah.  I expected more interesting flavors for $17), poutine (absolutely disgusting), and the steak.  We did know the steak was entree sized, but assumed we weren't ordering too much since we expected only a few bites from the two other orders.  From the menu it appeared that the concept was small plates, coming out as they were ready, shared by the table.  The beet came out within minutes of placing the order, so we started the meal by feeling we were being rushed.  We were only half way through when the poutine was ready, which would have been fine if both plates were staying on the table.  Apparently, however, we were expected to chow down on the beet, because our plates were removed and replaced with clean ones for the poutine.  The waiter then informed us that the steak was on the way.  Are you kidding?  I hadn't even finished  my first glass of wine and the meal was halfway over?  My husband asked him to slow it down and was given an annoyed look and told, ""it's already cooking.""  The waiter came back a minute later and said they would hold it after all.  What 'hold it' meant, apparently, was to keep cooking it until we were ready, turning our request for 'medium' to decidedly well done.  We had tried to eat the (just really gross) poutine, just because it seemed wasteful otherwise, and so were full by the time the steak arrived.  (Again, if the misnomer 'small plates' were not on the menu we would not have ordered three.)  The waiter didn't ask why we were asking for a doggie bag for steak with two bites eaten, as he clearly didn't care about our experience at all.  We were rushed in and out in 45 minutes, and even that was dragged out at our insistence.   The rest of the restaurant seemed to be having a wonderful time, so I don't know if it was just our waiter, if they wanted our table (the restaurant was full), or a combination of both.  Even if our experience was isolated, it was a terrible dinner all around and we both left in irritated moods.

They do take reservations, which is great to know. We walked in without one and were easily seated, likely because of the gross weather. The patrons were mostly couples and big groups of girls, it's BYOB so mimosas were flowing. Our waiter came over right away and was attentive throughout our meal. We ordered coffee and then decided to share several items, which is how their menu is intended to be ordered. A really nice touch to Bistro Dre is that were given bites of delicious pumpkin cake to start which successfully curbed our hunger before our entrees arrived. We went with the pumpkin waffles as our sweet dish and these did not disappoint. Huge portion, strawberries and whipped cream rounded out these tasty waffles. The pumpkin flavor wasn't too overpowering, we loved these. One of the savory dishes we shared was the salmon benedict. This came with tons of tasty vegetables, lots of salmon, and a poached egg on top. My only issue was that it was slightly bland, hot sauce was necessary. The other item we had was a Spanish omelet that was pretty standard. Chorizo, peppers, cheese, this was flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary. If I return for brunch in the future, I'll probably go with more novelty items, like the potato pancakes. Overall, nice addition to the Lakeview brunch scene!

And despite his disgusting behavior, the couple still tried to pay for their meal, and he told them ""I don't want your money, get the **** out."" Feeling extremely uncomfortable, my group and I were about to get up and leave when he walked into the middle of the restaurant and proceeded to go on a 10-minute long rant which was rage-filled and made us feel almost unsafe. We could barely understand him because he was slurring his words and wasn't speaking in full sentences. Then, as one of his staff members was trying to calm him down, he shoved him into a wall. As soon as we saw him leave the room, our group grabbed our things and left. One of the staff members profusely apologized to us as we were walking out and said something along the lines of this is a regular occurrence here.",-0.7885,0.846,0.061,0.092,0.5142246642246642

I was honestly thinking at the end that I would come back here, but  what happened  next was unreal. I literally thought i was on tv. No way this could be real. . . The chef (who turned out to be the owners son) started yelling at this couple at the bar telling them to get the f out. Literally yelling in there faces over and over again. He was visibly drunk and likely on drugs. I thought the couple did something awful to this guy but I came to find out they did nothing. In fact, they were too shocked to yell back at this guy and were essentially forced out with this drunk guy following them and cussing at them. At this point, the entire restaurant went silent watching this guy and it was frightening. After forcing the couple to leave, this guy walked back into the restaurant and addressed everyone in the place. Rambling on and on.... cussing and being inappropriate. My wife caught this part on video. It's hilarious footage. At the time though my jaw was on the table. It was almost painful to watch this man have a breakdown. I've read the other reviews and let me tell you that no one is exaggerating. In fact it was way worse.  I feel sorry for the staff. In fact, really sorry. This place needs to close immediately.

I mean this loser is cooking your food, no wonder it's so terrible. Fred Durst Jr was playing rap music inside an supposed Italian Bistro.

We had 18 adults and 6 kids, and everyone was overwhelmed by the amount of food and the quality. They couldn't stop talking about their experience. And to top it off, they served the kids a separate kids menu, and it was free! Everything was delicious! The chef even added the brussels sprouts and asparagus because he felt it would compliment the steak. It just showed that the chef truly cared about our dining experience. We brought our own beer and wine, and they even allowed us to bring our own cake, but that didn't stop them from still bringing out dessert to sample. Amazing!

Quite possibly the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten at a restaurant. The brisket was ""smoked"" but completely burned and inedible (tasted more like ash anyhow). The fried egg, sat atop the heap of garbage I just ordered, inexcusably stiff, like a egg mcmuffin patty or something? The gravy was fine, but there way hardly any of it. The fries were so fat they were over cooked on the outside and still raw, mealy and gritty on the inside. I never ever ever send food back when I dine out, but I had to make an exception today.  I ordered some potato pancake thing in its place (one of my friends had it and said it tasted good). The rest of my table finished, the removed their plates, and then about 5 minutes later, my replacement food finally arrived. About halfway through my next dish, the waiter ran by and dropped off some poached eggs, which were evidently part of my friend's (who got the same thing) and my dish. He had already finished and they cleared his plate.  Service was fine, but food was absolutely disgusting. I don't think anyone in my 4 person party really enjoyed their meal.

Between the table we ordered three different dishes, the blueberry french toast, apple topped waffles (can't remember the exact name of the dish), and the salmon benedict on a croissant. We all got coffee too, which was also notably terrible.  Honestly, this was in the top three worst meals I have ever had in a restaurant. Both toppings (blueberry and apple), seemed like store bought canned pie filling, very corn-starchy, cheap and utterly flavorless. Appalling. The apple topping was actually cold, and the waffles were soggy and lukewarm. Couldn't taste the french toast under the mountains of dark gloppy blueberry gel and watery whipped cream. The salmon was gritty and poor quality, and the salmon benedict only included ONE egg. There was also lettuce on the eggs benedict? Huh? Who on earth devised this blasphemous rendition of the deliciousness that is eggs benedict and then tacked on a $12 price tag?  Despite the restaurant being virtually empty, the food took more than half an hour and the waiter practically ignored our table, I had to chase after him to get refills on water and coffee. The silver lining per the service was the exceptionally friendly and polite busboy that paid more attention to our table than our waiter (who was too busy chatting up a table of cute girls). Too bad we couldn't insist on tipping him separately.  Yuck, yuck, yuck. Definitely pass on this one. I'll bet my life that you'd have better food and service at the Golden Nugget next door at 3am on a Tuesday than you ever would at this place.",-0.7194,0.83,0.078,0.091,0.5854166666666667
2014-10-13,5.0,"My husband and I were looking for a BYOB on a Thursday night so I yelped for a place near by and up came Bistro Dre. It was almost like Yelp knew us and was reminding us of ""that cute restaurant we always pass on our way to our favorite coffee shop"". We walked into Bistro Dre thinking it wouldn't be a problem to get a table for two on a rainy Thursday night. At first, they said there was a rehearsal dinner for 40 people coming into the restaurant in ten minutes and that they had no space, but then Nancy, the owner, came over and asked if we wanted to sit at their counter. Thinking my husband would say no, I looked to him and he had the biggest smile on his face and nodded excitedly. Just by walking in the door, my husband knew we would be in for a delicious meal!  We sat at the two seated counter and looked around admiring the homey and romantic decor. I was shocked to learn that the restaurant had only been open for two years after the decorations of cookbooks and a mishmash of pictures looked like they had been collected and hung over decades. It all just added to the charm of the place.  Our waiter introduced us to the menu and explained that they do ""small plates"" that are meant for sharing. I use the term small plates loosely, as there was nothing small about these portions- quite the opposite really! He also let us know that they had one order of fried green tomatoes left. Neither my husband nor I had ever tried this dish, but we both knew if there was only one plate left than we needed to have them! We made the right choice... they were PHENOMENAL! Even though we don't have much to compare them to we know they have to be close to the best fried green tomatoes in the city. We also split the ""mini burger"", which was the size of a regular burger--- amazing!  But last but certainly not least we ordered the FRIED CHICKEN! O.M.G. I did not know fried chicken could ever look or taste that good. Even though all of the other dishes we ordered were great, we wish we focused our appetite on the fried chicken alone. Next time we go back, which will be soon, we will loading up on that dish. The food was amazing but sitting at the counter added to our experience. We talked to Al and Nancy, the owners, all night and got to know them and their story. It was such a fun night and was exactly what we were looking for on our weeknight date night!

I've gone there with just my boyfriend, a small group, and more recently a party of 14 for my birthday.  Peter, the cutest waiter of all time took excellent care of us.  I highly recommend the chicken and cornbread waffles. This is not something I would usually order (nor have I ever had chicken and waffles anywhere else) but it's a dish that you can't miss.  I read others' yelp reviews and decided to give it a try...SOOOO GOOD.   We also always get the mac and cheese (with sun-dried tomatoes and scallions in it) and the brie cheese board. I tried additional dishes with the large group and everything was delicious.  You definitely need a reservation because it's so popular.  Oh and it's BYOB!!",0.9876,0.761,0.239,0.0,0.6512380952380953

2014-04-05,5.0,"My sister reserved this quaint spot for her post wedding dinner. There were 7 of us total and we arrived late due to traffic. The waiter informed us that we had to finish up by 8:30 as there was another reservation after us which was completely understandable as the restaurant is quite small and we did have plenty of time to enjoy our meal.  We brought bottles of sparkling wine and regular wine and the waiter brought out buckets of ice to chill our beverages and he served them as well - champagne flutes and all.  I had saved up for this meal the whole day as had the rest of our party. We sampled the steak frites, pork medalions, white fish, chicken and waffles, quinoa salad, vegetarian flatbread and poutine. The food came out really fast - which was great since we wasted no time and were ready to devour the napkins.  Every dish was better than the next. Steak and pork were cooked perfectly. First poutine experience will be hard to beat by any others after this. Also our first chicken and waffle experience - holy mother of god that was so good - the boneless chicken thighs were crispy and juicy and the cornbread waffles - to die for.  Also the beans are made with freaking root beer - party in my mouth - f yeah! Chef Dre came out to congratulate my sis and her new beau which I thought was a nice touch and we got to tell him how much we enjoyed his food - he is a true culinary gem. They sent us some complimentary desserts as well and accommodated our table as we had some folks with nut and chocolate allergies. We tasted the banana bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream and pop corn and apple cobbler. WOW - perfect end to a wonderful meal. I think the banana bread pudding was the winner for me - I am a sucker for caramel. The patrons are also great - one came over and gave us a half bottle of wine they weren't able to finish. It would have been a sin to let wine go to waste so we graciously accepted it. Another patron helped take some photos of our party - very thoughtful folks here!

The waiter was attentive but a bit awkward or aloof, like perhaps I wasn't supposed to be there. I spent about 5 minutes with the brunch menu and ordered coffee and the Belgium Fries--thick-cut fries with White Truffle Cheddar Fondue / Roasted Brisket / Herbs / Fried Egg. The food came out quickly in a lovely cast-iron bowl and tasted very, very good, with plenty left over. The coffee was just okay--I really would have expected a restaurant of this caliber to have perfected their coffee.

What started out as a wonderful evening, ended as one of the worst dining experiences ever had. Bistro Dre is certainly adorable on the inside, our waiter was quite pleasant and the food was delicious. Some items we enjoyed were the lobster bisque soup, the vegan flat bread, Belgium fries and the seared quinoa whitefish.  The complete and utter disappointment came once our desserts were ordered. We had only been dining for about 2 hours at this point. Our waiter had not paced our meal, nor did he inform us that we needed to be out by a certain time. We were asked by one owner to move tables, but no tables were available, then we were asked by the other owner to move to the bar, but there was no room there either. We were then asked again, to hurry up and pay our bill and leave, because now we upset one of the owners since we didn't move fast enough. We quickly paid our bill and moved to an open table that was finally available. There were a few dessert plates left from the previous diners and we just moved them off to the side, one of the owners came by again and asked us to stop moving the plates and said, ""You know I can kick you out of here!""  We left immediately, knowing we would NEVER go back again, nor would we recommend anyone supporting Bistro Dre's customer harassment.

I noticed they were turning on space heaters but it was still extremely cold. The service was friendly and very good. The server brought some extra banana bread and a tube of applesauce for the baby. The food was pretty good, except for the steak that came with my eggs. It was tough and appeared to be a somewhat inferior cut of meat. The biggest reason for knocking off 2 stars is that it was absolutely freezing in the restaurant, in spite of the space heaters. By the time we left, our feet were feeling numb. A painfully cold environment detracts from the quality of the food. One person also complained about a foul odor (like sewer gas) wafting through the place.

2014-02-16,1.0,"We found this place walking in the neighborhood last summer, thought it was super cute and have looked forward to trying it ever since. We made our Valentine's Day reservation there in January. Unfortunately, I honestly think this was both of our worst service experience in a Chicago restaurant. When we arrived, we were followed through the door into the nonexistent waiting area by a large party, which allowed no room to move. After about two minutes waiting here, the person we took to be the owner saw us and slowly walked over, unphased by the crowd at the door. We gave him our reservation name to which he responded by looking around the restaurant and telling us to hold on. He then helped the large party, whose reservation they either didn't have or was messed up. After several minutes of standing in the middle of the ordeal, my boyfriend chimed in again and was basically told we'd have to wait until someone finished their dinner, no time frame.  After about 25 minutes of standing awkwardly at the back, surprised at how unapologetic anyone was about overbooking their tables, watching other parties be seated because they were the right size for the available tables, we got a place at their bar. The server there basically threw down some bread, poured our wine, then didn't come back for 10+ minutes because an even bigger party had just arrived, was seated, and was apparently also his to cover. Eventually, another waiter walking by noticed we were just sitting there waiting, asked if we'd been helped. Well basically we hadn't yet, so we told him no. He was the first person to actually explain the basics of the menu to us and show any interest in treating us like more than warm bodies. We put our order in and then the first waiter started arguing with him from behind us that he was already covering us.  While waiting for and eating our food, multiple people stopped back behind the bar, leaving dirty bar rags next to my boyfriend's arm, which was kind of gross. Then, another party who was forced to wait at the back asked if they could open their wine, and was handed an opener so he could stand next to my boyfriend's arm and struggle to open it. At least a server could've opened their wine behind the counter so the person wasn't breathing down our neck as he tried to do it himself. He then left his wine sitting there, and the first server walked by and started to pour it into our glasses before we stopped him. We also watched the owner wander around aimlessly, not helping much, while the servers seemed to be struggling to keep up. The food we had was good except for the salmon, which had way too much cream sauce.  We understand that this is a small space that a lot of people were working around each other in, and that it was Valentine's weekend so things were busier and slower than usual. But there are ways to provide good service and speak to people that respect their time and money in coming to your establishment, especially for a special occasion. And no one except our eventual waiter Mike made any effort to thank us for our business or treat us like anything more than an annoyance that was taking time away from the huge parties they'd overbooked, when we'd had our reservation for weeks. Maybe a normal day is very different and more enjoyable here, but with so many restaurants in the city that have friendly hostesses and waitstaff, I doubt we'll take the time to give it another shot.",0.8794,0.873,0.073,0.054,0.4375899470899471

The fries were cooked Belgian style (double fried) , the red wine gravy was very flavorful.  The touch of cheese and fried egg just made this dish all the more decadent.

I wasn't feeling the dessert from the description on the menu, but when our waiter shared his opinion of it and described the dessert in higher detail we just had to try it. The banana bread was so good! it was very moist. The salted caramel was tasty and adding the popcorn to the dessert added another level of experience.

2013-12-30,4.0,"::driving by:: Me: Bistro Dre? Him: Dre? Dr. Dre opened a restaurant? ::snickers:: Since we're so mature, we giggled at the name for months every time we passed the place. We started to take the place seriously when we noticed the steady crowds and heard glowing reviews from friends. Bistro Dre sits in the old Macondo space and has been beautifully transformed. The layout is very similar, but the space feels much less cluttered and warm, almost homey. The tables are small and fairly close together; it felt a bit like communal dining and fitting all of our plates on the table was a bit like a game of Jenga. I wouldn't do an intimate dinner here, it's BYO with no corkage fee, which means it's a mecca for larger groups and can get noisy. Much of the Bistro Dre menu is meant for sharing. For two people with very different eating habits, it becomes a complicated venn diagram of choices. To start, we went with the macaroni and cheese. The plate came in a 5x7 casserole dish and was a heaping portion. The macaroni, served with sun dried tomatoes and green beans, was delicious and decadent. In hindsight it probably wasn't the best dish to start with as we had trouble leaving room for our entrees. For our entrees, he ordered the fried chicken and cornbread waffles* and I ordered the blackened whitefish. The timing of our dishes was a bit off; his meal came out nearly 10 minutes before mine, which meant I filled up on even more macaroni. I don't eat chicken, so the only part of his dish I tried were the waffles. The waffles were excellent, sweet and moist they almost convinced me I should invest in a waffle maker. For what it's worth, he raved about his dish and wondered why he was given a steak knife - everything was so tender. My whitefish was served over red lentils, carrots and fingerling potatoes. The hearty portion of whitefish was deliciously moist and flaky, although missing the essence of heat most blackened dishes possess.  Aside from the timing of our entrees, service was very friendly and attentive. Waters were filled, plates were cleared, and our wine was relocated when it became clear we'd run out of room on the table. We left stuffed to the gills and no longer snickering at the name; Bistro Dre brang it. * Tuesdays chicken and waffles is half price.",0.9878,0.832,0.123,0.045,0.5543650793650793

The atmosphere is warm and since it's small, when you walk in, it smells fantastic because the kitchen is right there. The service is super friendly and the food is delicious. I highly recommend making a rez because the secret is out on this place- it was packed when I walked in at 8:45. Now let's talk food...we had: the mac and cheese, chicken and waffles, poutine and the brisket flatbread. All were DELICIOUS but I have to say for me, the standout was the chicken and waffles. They brought it out with some gravy, honey and syrup too and omg...sweet and savory goodness! Be still my heart- if I ate like this all the time, my heart probably would be still (see what I did there?).

2013-11-24,2.0,"My partner and I attended dinner on Tuesday, November 19th. IT was my partners birthday, and after reading such rave reviews about your restaurant, we figured we'd give it a try. The atmosphere was great--very cute and cozy. The food, however, was less than mediocre. We're not the type to complain, however, nothing seemed as fresh, or as good as it could have been. Upon finishing our meal, we headed home, where both our stomaches started hurting. Vomiting and diarrhea ensued, and we have both been ill since. I am not sure what we eat that was contaminated, however, a doctor told us that it was obviously something from that dinner.  We ordered: Fried green tomatoes French onion soup Roasted pear salad NY strip with bleu cheese The most upsetting thing to us was the steak--my partner was able to salvage only 1/2 of it, since it was so fatty. We suggest including the cooking method on the menu--a broiled steak is never appetizing. Also, perhaps serve a smaller, better quality piece of meat, rather than a 16oz mediocre one. Although the service was good, we remain to be disappointed with the food. A $15 dollar salad should include more than just some arugula and an ounce of cheese. A blue cheese crust should be made with crumbles, not slices of blue cheese. The french onion soup was good, as were the tomatoes, however, both seemed to have been sitting under hot lamps for quite some time before being brought to our table.  We appreciate small-businesses, however, the food falls more into the ""mom and pop"" type restaurant, rather than the ""bistro"" category as it us under. I am not complaining solely to complain, just stating my opinion, and reporting our food poisoning incident.

At first glance the interior is cute but a little kitchy. Either way it didn't matter because we sat outside. The outdoor seating is very cute and we had the added benefit of live music which we could hear from Oktoberfest on the next street over. The BYOB feature is great and our server poured us each a glass of the Pinot Noir we had brought. The service is honestly fantastic. Our server was nothing but jokes all night, and VERY attentive. Maybe a bit much for a couple or an intimate affair, but perfect for our night out. For food we ordered two cups of Lobster Bisque (delicious), the Poutine Duck Fat Fries (delicious, but a little heavy, easily enough for 5 people), the Apple/Baked Goat Cheese Salad (ORDER THIS, this was exactly what we needed to lighten the meal), the Sausage/Proscuitto Flatbread (my favorite, although two other diners thought it was just average), and Cinnamon Apple Pork Schnitzel (also delicious, but we were so full by the time it came that we couldn't finish it). As far as ordering goes, I would have only ordered 3 dishes for the four of us since we had the soup as well. Know that the portions are VERY large and they mean it when they say family style. For the amount of food we got, our bill of $94 seemed extremely reasonable.  The only reason Bistro Dre is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the interior decor.

2013-08-08,3.0,"I do love Bistro Dre...or at least I did when there were 2 of us that come over for dinner.  We had the eggplant flatbread, foie gras burger and chicken and waffles - all very good.  I did like it so much, that I wanted to come back here with a bigger crew to try everything else on the menu. Voila - perfect occasion - my mom's birthday.  Getting 12 people should be enough to try just about everything on the menu!  Well, the only thing that we couldn't buy that evening, was timely service.   Reading some of the larger party reviews, I decided to be prepared and pre-order some cold food to be on the table as the party arrived.   Problem solved, right?  Well, the 4 things that we ""pre-ordered"" didn't all show up until almost an hour later.  Cheese plate showed up in 25 minutes, but the cheese was cubed cheese from Jewel, not what I was expecting from this place.   After a while, food started to come out pretty fast, but that was 2.5 hours into our meal. Since we weren't getting the food in the beginning, we over-ordered a bit and once all the food actually showed up - it was excellent.   The steak was overdone, but they took care of it.  The short ribs were just ok.  But the piece de resistance - chicken with waffles, was great as before.   Bottom line: 1. Go there with smaller parties, no more than 4 people. 2. Order the chicken and waffles (table favorite)  3. Order the eggplant flatbread (another table favorite)  5. Bring lots of wine, just in case you have to wait I would give this place 2 stars if it was my first time there, with this larger party.  I added as star because we did have a good experience there when it was just the 2 of us.   And the people at the restaurant are actually great and try very hard...despite the lack of organization.",0.9944,0.805,0.173,0.022,0.612470238095238
2013-08-05,2.0,"Food - 3 stars for dinner, 4 stars for brunch Ambiance - 4 stars (very cute and quaint) Price - 3 stars (love that it's BYOB) Service - 1.5 stars for execution, 4.5 stars for effort In a nutshell, Bistro Dre has pretty good food but glacial service.  I have now been to Bistro Dre a couple times over the last month. I first tried to make a reservation on Open Table and found that they were completely booked, so I thought I was missing out on something good! The next weekend I made another Open Table reservation.  For dinner, we walked in and the host (an adorable older gentleman) had no record of our reservation. Kind of annoying if you are going to use Open Table, but fortunately (?) a couple who had already been seated was looking at the menu and chose to get up and leave. I think they were turned off by the prices, which seem high until you learn the plates are meant for family style sharing.  The Belgian Fries were delicious and decadent. I had a salmon dish that was a little too salty but overall pretty good. Overall the food was okay. I left thinking our fatal flaw was not ordering the mac n' cheese.... maybe next time.  Where the evening fell apart was the slow service. There seemed to be miscommunication among the servers as to who was serving which table. We waited 15-20 minutes to order our food. When he had clearly completed our meal, we had another 15 minute wait to get the table cleared and another 15 minutes to get the check. The servers are all nice, accommodating, friendly... it's just hard to get their attention! Our server had said they were ""slammed"" and a little short staffed. Considering the reservations were completely full, they had to see this coming.  We went back for brunch this weekend with a group of 5. We got in at just the right time and had great service. Then, four or five more parties walked in, and we were forgotten. Again the server said they were down one staff person, but it seems to me this is a common occurrence here.  The brunch food was FANTASTIC!! We enjoyed it much more than what we chose when we were there for dinner. I ordered the quinoa hash which was unique and delicious (and a huge serving). The sweet waffle was delicious. Complimentary banana bread - YUM. My only suggestion was that the servings were so huge, we could have approached the meal by sharing maybe 4 plates instead of 5. At $12 - $15, an entree, this would have been a good option. I realized it is shared plates for dinner, but no one mentioned that might be a good idea for the brunch menu as well.  Again, the service was somewhat slow with the worst waiting for our check for 25 minutes.  Overall, I really like the place and will probably give it another shot as I love having a go-to spot just around the corner from our house. You can tell they really care about the food and enjoy serving their guests. I just hope they work on staffing and the coordination of their servers so things run more smoothly.",0.9986,0.753,0.202,0.045,0.547233382936508

2013-07-03,4.0,"Bistro Dre:  Another New Restaurant You Should Try ~John  I collect restaurants. I found another one to add to my list, it's called Bistro Dre.  I remember seeing it when it first opened, the decor alone caught my attention, distracting me from my conversation with it's French bistro influences, its carefully decorated but informal flair. Finally went last night.  BYOB.  Nice.  I've never truly appreciated the value of this until last night.  No corking fee. Our $6 Shariz from Trader Joe's started off a nice evening. Brad our culinary guide suggested ordering 3 entrees, which worked well. We started off with the Spinach Salad (Fuji Apples / Goat Cheese / Candied Almonds / Pomegranate Seeds / Balsamic Syrup).  I'm sooo picky and this dish so delivered.   It achieved a nice balance, the trick was to make sure your bite included some of the cheese, and some of the pomegranite seeds and so on.  Very well done. Brad then brought out the the oysters, which I think were a special as I don't see them on their website.  Breaded (it was actually nicer than breaded but I didn't ask what it was unfortunately), the oysters were paired with a sauce on the side, that was spicy and which was a nice complement.  We both thought the sauce was a wee bit too hot, but there were no leftovers. Next we had the chicken and waffles.  Cornbread waffles.  Very cool.  Corn gravy.  Yes, very good.  The potato salad with little bits of pickle?  Memorable.  I want to make it that way now.  The chicken?  Excellent.  I'm a sucker for fried chicken, and they used chicken thighs which are far more tasty.  Let me repeat, the chicken was excellent and this needs to be one of the dishes you order.  The chicken split into 5-6 different pieces, very easy to share. Impulsively, we ordered a 4th entree, the Mac'n Cheese.  Oops.  Too full, we only managed three bites apiece.  Very nice.  I might have the leftovers later and update my review. To recap, Bistro Dre is nicely decorated and captures the bistro feel.  The food was very good, like Chicago foodie good.  Like tell your friends go back and try other items on the menu good.  Brad brought out a dish every 10-15 minutes and the pacing was perfect.  Street parking was abundant during the week when we got there for our 6:30 reservation.  Bon appetit!",0.998,0.736,0.218,0.045,0.6798271343169303

When i learned that a new restaurant had come in, I had to try it! Dragged a friend here for brunch, it was rather empty when we were here. My take is they just opened. The interior didn't change much from before, but they definitely make better use of the space. I think the were trying still to figure out this place since things seemed a little messy (the menu was a piece of paper). Services was a little spotty as well, our waiter disappeared and someone else came to replace him without introducing himself - I was so confused. But they were all very nice, and I understand in the beginning there are lots to straight out.  I wanted oatmeal, and there was none on the menu. I asked the server. Few minutes later, the chef walked out and asked who wanted oatmeal. Uh oh, i didn't do anything wrong, I hope. I mean, nothing's wrong with just asking right?  I admitted that I just want something warm and simple (this was about 2 months back so it was still a little chilly outside). He said he'd take care of me, and he did. He whipped up a delicious oatmeal that was on point - and it wasn't the simple stuff I make at home - this was some serious oatmeal - rosemary, apple, brown sugar, cinnamon and some other spices work so well together to make a warm, hearty and aromatic brunch. Chef even came out to check on me later - I felt so special.  And he sure does know how to make his customer feel special. The table next to us ordered 2 items for brunch and ended up with a lot more. He kept sending out things from the kitchen. Their tables were overflowing with huge plates of food.

The servers provided extra cups for the wine we had with us and provided plenty more cups and ice for cocktails when asked, then checked with us regularly throughout the meal to see if we needed more plates or water or any other services. The food was delicious and very generously portioned - everyone was sharing bites around and we didn't have anything that wasn't really tasty and even with sharing with a table of 10 or so people we weren't running out of the most popular things like the Belgian fries. The servers brought us more of the delicious cheese sauce since we ran low quickly with the sharing. The beets were delicious, the pistachio pesto a nice lightly salty balance to their rich natural sweetness (and ours weren't soggy, as some below were described).  The macaroni and cheese was so good and the steak's seasoning (from the bite I got) was delicious. I loved the toasted fennel seeds in the quinoa on the whitefish.

The other dishes we had were really divine -- the beet stuffed beets (sounds strange) were incredible.  Beets stuffed with a a mixture of beets, dill, pistachios, served on top of a pistachio pesto -- the complementary flavors of beets + pistachios again were unlike you see many places.

We had 8:30 reservations from Opentable - I'm seeing in a number of reviews that they don't have any sense of what a reservation means - we arrived and were told they didn't know when they could seat us. We lingered at the counter area and drank a bottle of wine, they sent us a complimentary flatbread.  Unfortunately it was all downhill after that. Ordinarily I would have walked out after nearly a 90 minute wait, but it felt like wine with friends etc so we stayed. When we did get seated, we didn't get our food until nearly 10:30 - when we brought this up to our server, the chef's girlfriend who we'd been chatting with reminded us again that she had already worked a long day at her other job and was really tired etc. In addition she joked that she would ""stab us with one these (steak) knives"" she was bringing for our meal. Incredibly inappropriate! When I said that I understood she had a long day, but this isn't how a restaurant is supposed to work - not two hours later, not with reservation etc - at which time she sent the owner over. He launched into his ""we can't control how long people hold onto tables"" speech - he continued that he has no restaurant experience (it shows!) and he told us that ""you know what happens to people who are unhappy? They don't come back"" - great! You got it pal! We are never coming back!  The food is barely worth mentioning. The flatbread was tasty, the pea stew was nothing special (watery soup with peas and ham) and the steak frite was tough (the fries however were good). We all got our mains at different times - the final one arriving 25 minutes after the first one. So even at nearly 11 pm they couldn't get four mains out at the same time. The kicker? Nothing was taken off the bill.

The space is nice, and the restaurant knows what it wants to be, but just fails, epically I might add.  The service plays on the whole hipster care but not care persona, which is fine, but you have to know when you've crossed the line into complete incompetence and realize your patrons may have a life outside of your restaurant they may want to get to.   The food was seriously horrendous. Everyone has different taste buds, I get it, but when an entire table agrees that the three steaks you ordered are inedible because they've been doused in a quarry of salt, something's gone horribly wrong.

Apparently, the menu changes fairly frequently, which I like the idea of. Wednesday night, Dinner for 2 dudes-  2 soups, a salad, 2 entrees, 2 ice creams = $73 total, so a little more with tip. It was very filling and we did get the most expensive things on the menu: Asparagus soup- pretty good- too salty, not enough cream, but close to really good French Onion soup= really good, a bit salty too Asparagus 'salad' - grilled asparagus topped with a bernaise-like sauce with yellow cherry tomatoes and a duck egg on top- good stuff Pork Chop - nice and large, size of two pork chops, it was filleted, so easily split between two people- could easily be split by more. Real good NY Strip steak- ordered medium- was cooked right, but it was so thick, the rare part in the middle was hard to chew. Its clearly a choice cut meat, so will cook up nice as reheated- it was a big piece of meat though- pretty similar to what you get at Tango Sur- side of mashed potatoes was excellent too, and the red wine sauce was Excellent as well. Anyway, it would probably be better if it wasn't such a thick cut. Ice cream desert- you can get 1 scoop each of the 3 flavors available- the oatmeal something was the best- vanilla was very smooth too though. Overall, the knocks are that some dishes were too salty (and I like overly salted foods) and the service was a bit lacking. Our guy had 3 tables and we were still wondering where the hell he was. Also, serving the steak without first bring out the new plates and silverware (steak knives) we needed- rookie mistake sort of thing.

An affront to onions everywhere.  The ""fries"" were these guys' attempt on poutin.   Epic fail.  We were the first party seated on a Saturday night and they only had 1 of the chocolate desserts left?  Huh?  The server didn't want to be there any more than we did, recognizing the food was garbage.

2013-03-10,1.0,"To preface this, I know that this review is terribly long, but I urge you to read on to see the testimony of two people that really love food (but are not snobby about it)  as they experienced possibly the worst restaurant experience ever.    Last weekend, Luke and I, unwillingly, spent an hour and a half at the incredulously 4 star yelp rated Bistro Dre.  How this establishment has been able to receive this high of a rating baffles me. Upon entering, we noticed that the place only had one large party already there.  On a Sunday.  In Lakeview.  I should have known this foreshadowed the horrible experience that was to follow.  The service was awful from the moment we entered.  The hostess/server greeted us and offered us a table after a good three minutes of just standing there awkwardly.  She sat us at the table by the window offering no water, menus or silverware.  Luke and I sat chatting, trying to stare the woman down in an attempt to get some service.  After about 10 minutes, we were given one menu, and our glasses were filled with water.  We looked over our menus and saw two dishes that really appealed to us.  We were ready to order fairly quickly, but figured it would take at least 5 minutes for her to come back to us.  We were wrong:  It took her another 15.  Did I mention that there was only one other table there?  We ordered our food:  fries served with melted white cheese, an egg (served any way you'd like), and brisket and an order of croissant french toast served with caramel ice-cream. I ordered a coffee as well.  I got the coffee after a while, which was absolutely disgusting.  There were little bits of who knows what, swirling, twirling, and floating in my mug.  I was afraid to drink it.  I tasted it tentatively, and was not shocked to find that it tasted terrible.  It did not even taste like coffee.  I paid $3 for that coffee.  I could have gotten amazing coffee from Heritage Bikes down the street for less. As we waited for our order to come, another couple came in and another large party.  About 15 minutes after ordering, I realized I never told her what kind of egg I wanted on the fries.  So I flagged her down and asked her, ""did you need to know what kind of egg I want?""  She replied, ""Oh, I assumed you wanted over easy.  We can change it if you'd like.""  I told her it was okay... I mean, we had already waited that long.  To the server at Bistro Dre:  Please remember that phrase about assuming... So we waited. And waited. And waited. I saw the tables that came in after us get their food before us. We finally got ONE plate of food, the fries, after another 15 minutes and dug in praying that the food would compensate for the god awful service and coffee.  At least we wanted to dig in.  However the server never gave us silverware...  We tried to flag her down, but we ended up having to get our own silverware from the hostess stand.  Sadly, the food did not live up to its 4-star rating.  The food was cold, which was a disappointment after waiting so long.  The brisket was tough, and hard to cut with a knife.  The egg was also overcooked and barely runny. We finished quickly and the second plate, the croissant french toast, came out another 15 minutes after we finished.  The server told us it was on the house since everything took so long.  I guess even they realized their service was terrible.  We asked for our check as soon as she put the plate down in order to end the seemingly torturous restaurant experience.  The french toast was okay in itself, but it was hard to enjoy at all because we just wanted to leave. The server apologized saying that they are ""new to brunch,"" (not totally true), and that they were still ""getting the brunch thing down.""  Really?  I think you should have your ""brunch thing down""  when you are handing out cards for customers to vote for you on Time Out Chicago as a best of anything... As if it weren't painfully obvious, we are never returning again. SIDE NOTE:  We had heard the couple sitting next to us talking about all the things they wanted to try, but they left after just trying one plate because they thought the service was terrible too.",-0.4698,0.831,0.082,0.087,0.5423559809598769

The best brunch I have had in Chicago in a looonggg time. How can I relay this to you through the computer screen? You must go here. You must.

Or what kind of toast does this come with?   She had to tun back to the kitchen every single time which i thought was alittle odd but whatever is what i thought at the time. The coffee refills weren't that attentive compared to any other brunch place.  And mind you the tiny restaurant wasnt even half full.   Then the kicker is when im sittig there talking to mu better half who was eating his brunch when he suddenly asked me where the heck my food was.   We realized it was at least 50 minutes! Since the waitress took my order!!! I flagged her down and she said its on its way out in a few minutes.   No apology.  No explanation.  Never bothered to even have the courtesy to check in on me during the time i was waiting for my food.  At any other establishment if the wait time for your meal is delayed the server always comes out to let you know and apologizes.  I expressed my discontent with the Bistro Dre  waitress and she just walked away.

2013-03-04,5.0,"My sister has been raving about Bistro Dre for awhile now so when looking for a place to celebrate a good friend's birthday Bistro Dre seemed perfect.  I have to start out describing the ambiance of Bistro Dre. Upon entering you are transported to a romantic and cozy spot. All of the tables are made of a warm wood and are close together, but not too close. Everyone there was sipping on wine over enormous plates of delicious looking food and everyone seemed to be relaxed and having a good time.  My friends and I were immediately seated at a cozy little table for five near the front door. We were a bit flummoxed by the menu at the beginning as it said sharing plates but the portions seemed huge. Our outstanding waitress gave us a recommendation about how much food to order for the table and it made things much more clear. There were four of us eating so we chose the sesame spinach, the brisket fries topped with cheese fondue, the bacon macaroni and cheese and the crab potstickers. Every dish was absolutely outstanding!  - Bacon macaroni and cheese: crispy bacon, rich cheese sauce and perfectly cooked rigatoni resulted in the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had (and that's saying a lot) - Crab potstickers: these were delicious and hearty, definitely a unique take on the potsticker. they came with an aioli and a soy sauce.  - Brisket fries: these were outstanding! the brisket was tender and juicy and the fries and fondue were great as well - Sesame spinach: cannot go wrong with spinach, they gave us heaps and it was very flavorful  Our amazing waitress also treated my friend to a free dessert for her birthday. We got banana bread cake, a dessert I normally wouldn't go for but one bite of this had me coming back for more. It was topped with a rich caramel sauce and ice cream and was incredibly delicious. I also have to mention that Bistro Dre is a BYOB with no corking fee. I love BYOBs and am frequently disappointed there are no many that serve American food in the city. Bistro Dre is the perfect anecdote to that problem and the fact that it is BYOB makes it even better!  I would say stop whatever you're doing and make plans to check out Bistro Dre.

2013-02-28,4.0,"I discovered this new neighborhood gem on a cold winter's night searching for BYOB restaurants close to home.  I was happy to see they were on Open Table, and I secured a prime time Sat night reservation.  I also went back the snowy night last week (this is the perfect restaurant for those kind of nights!), and noticed some changes that I'll mention throughout. As a fan of Grocery Bistro (former BYOB in the West Loop) back in the day, I was excited to see that the chef had opened something new.  Upon walking in, I immediately felt comfy and warm, and was surprised to see tables open.  As the night continued, it filled up, but my guess is that this will change as word gets out.  There is room for improvement when it comes to the waitstaff service.  But as long as my wine gets opened and poured quickly, I become very patient. Back to the food - it is sharing plates.  I'm so used to sharing plates meaning two bites, but as the plates were coming out, I realized the portions would not easily be conquered.  I recommend three plates for two people.  The lobster mac and cheese and fries with white cheddar are rich, but each bite gets you wanting more.  The highlight is the fried chicken and waffles (bacon cornbread waffles, btw).  It was decent the first time I tried it, but it was very good the second time.  The chef was talking to the tables throughout the evening and mentioned how he constantly tries to improve his dishes until they get to a point where he doesn't mess with it anymore - and the chicken is at that point.   The restaurant is actually in the running for Time Out Chicago's magazine ""newest byob,"" so I recommend trying before it gets the publicity. The only thing that surprised me was the size of the dessert.  With all the other dishes so massive, I was expecting a huge dessert portion.  It wasn't small, but the glutton in me wanted more.   My recommendation:  Come hungry and ready to eat!  If you're counting calories, this is not the place for you.",0.9947,0.839,0.154,0.007,0.5424168514412416

The whole place was empty when we first got there, and then slowly people started to trickle in. What a little Lakeview gem.

2013-02-23,4.0,"It was 5:30 Friday afternoon and with no plans yet on where to eat I decided to take a mental walk in my head thru the neighborhood and pictured the restaurants in the area. There was Fish Bar and DMK, Lou Malnaties, Pennys. Papacitos hey what was that place across the street from Papacitos  some bistro small plate place. I looked it up on trusty yelp there it was Bistro Dre, BYOB, shared plates and local lets give it a try. It was early Friday and we had no reservation so I called and the host said come on in and they would find a place for us. We arrived about 6:30  the place was not full very cute warm interior small place with a little bar in back you can eat at overall very comfortable and quaint atmosphere. Even though there were many open tables we where seated at the 10 seat communal table not my favorite but we had the end of the table to ourselves and the table itself was wide so lots of room for our wine and food. The waiter opened our wine poured us a glass  and we took a look at the menu, good start it was great one of those menus where you want to try it all. It's a one page menu that changes daily or often based on season and ingredients. We started with a cheese and meat board $18 it was very tasty good portion a good variety of items to mix and match but only one meat item, a duck terrine, which was excellent but would of been nice to have at least one more meat option. As I mentioned there where numerous great sounding dishes but we settled on fried chicken and waffles with gravy cost about 21 bucks. What a good choice the 3 good sized chicken thighs where boneless cut in half juicy and moist but perfectly crispy with perfect seasoning, the waffles were made with corn meal and had a sweet flavor in a waffle I never had and the gravy was so good we asked for another serving of it to dunk everything in. We finished with a apple cobbler with oatmeal ice cream it was fabulous and a great portion for 6 bucks enough for 4 to share for sure.  It was a great meal and we where very happy with the food, service was good and the people where friendly, we even had fun chatting a bit with people at the communal table, but here is my issue. Everything on the menu that day was $17 or more even the spinach salad which makes it hard to try a lot of things unless you are with 4 people or more. The least expensive item other then sides and dessert which cost about 6 bucks each were truffle fries for 8 bucks. There where numerous things we wanted to try but spinach salad, quinoa or other dishes that would be considered more starters  but cost almost the same price of a steak,fish or a chicken dish makes no sense. The thing that confuses me more is the menu on Bistro Dre web site had the prices totally different then the menu price at the restaurant, a spinach salad is 10 bucks which is fairly priced but $17 at the restaurant, the meat and cheese plates are $12 on the web but $18 when you get there, The onion soup is $5 on the web site and $8 on the menu at the restaurant, the rest of the menu on the web site seems priced out so you can try more then 2 things if you are a party of two, with more standard small plate or starter prices. Maybe they should divide the menu to big and small shared plates so a couple or a large party can mix and match more easily and at a fair cost. Being a party of 2 with all the dishes being so expensive it's hard to get more then 2 items unless you have not eaten in a week or just don't care about the cost of your meal. Bistro Dre is listed as 2 $'s but I think with all the items being $17 and up its more 3 $'s.  Overall the food was very good as was the service, the atmosphere and who doesn't appreciate a BYOB. My only issue with Bistro Dre was the pricing as it made it difficult to order a starter and try numerous things which  is kind of the idea of shared plates. The menu changes and maybe the prices do also we will be back and maybe bring a few more people so we can try more things.",0.9989,0.811,0.156,0.033,0.5600681605975725

Despite having a 7:30 reservation (and confirming the day before) when we arrived we were told the reservation was for 8:00. Oh well. We waited and I'm pretty sure that the host asked the earlier party seated at our table to leave so we could be seated. The menu is ""small plates"" but isn't really small plates. Which makes the fact that things come out as they're ready a little odd since the food is not in fact designed to share.  Clearly the kitchen was also having a bad night. I heard our waiter comp dishes to multiple tables due to how long they were taking. Most of the food was bland (quinoa ""salad"", spinach salad, beets) except for the excessively salty steak. So salty that two out of four orders were inedible. And the third was so overcooked it was tough to chew. We also ordered risotto and mac & cheese that wasn't served until we had asked for our check. For those of us planning on eating that as a main meal we really weren't left with anything to eat. In total it took us 4 hours to be seated and served, which was not only ridiculous but extremely disappointing.

Waited over an hour for food.  1st out of three dishes arrived and it was cold, and missing a key ingredient. Couldn't be bothered waiting another 20 mins to get the waiter's attention so we got up and walked out.  I dine out 2-3 times a week and this is only the second time in my entire life I've walked out of a restaurant.  Terrible, terrible experience. If they could not handle the crowd or were severely understaffed that day, they should not have opened. Every other customer in the place was also unhappy, and waiting for their food for an inordinately long period of time.  It's business suicide as far as I'm concerned.

Our waiter was not helpful or attentive, and the place was relatively empty so I don't think he was just slowed down because he was too busy.  We saw on the menu that the dishes are to be shared, but we weren't really feeling it. We were a party of 8, and we all wanted to order our own dishes and we'd just steal bites of anything else we wanted to try. He came to take our order, but after he took 5, he left (reminder there were 8 of us!). He went to the kitchen for a while, then came back and served another table, then took another table's order. We had to flag him down and tell him he didn't get everyone in our party, and he was really confused. The food came out horribly staggered. Maybe that's how it works since they are supposed to be shared plates, but we told him we were each ordering our own meals and it was pretty obvious we were stealing bites, not sharing the whole dish. Even if we were all planning to share all the dishes, the order was awkward. We had a plate full of fries as the only dish on our table for a while. Then we got a couple of main dishes, then some more sides. Then 20 minutes later our final 2 entrees. One had been ordered in the first group and one in the second, so I'm not positive how that worked out.

Reservations were easy to come by which was surprising.  The menu isn't really tapas. There is a section of soups, meat and cheese plate, and a few small-normal sized sides like Truffle fries, Truffle mac n cheese, Quinoa, and the like. The entrees could be shared between 2 or 3 people if need be. Look out for the flatbreads, they are yummy. We ordered the whole gamete. Accidentally got 2 orders of Truffle Mac n Cheese, which is served as a huge portion, so no worries there! It was fantastic and so were the drenched Truffle fries.  I heard the french onion soup is fantastic but the meat and cheese plate was disappointing. Why, you ask? They hardly serve you any meat. Maybe about 6 tiny round slices of what looked to be the same kind of meat. Unimpressed. The cheese, however, was plentiful and there were several kinds, including brie which I love. Moving on. We decided to split the country fried chicken and the whitefish. The fried chicken w/pumpkin waffles was a bit more fried skin than anything. I guess that's what happens with fried chicken. If you're Eric Cartman, you have no beef with this. The whitefish was nice--I probably wouldn't split it 3 ways though if you only had one appetizer shared. All in all, I liked this place. The service was very strange and another friend of mine concluded the same as well at another table. The owner seemed confused and the waitress's head seemed in the clouds. It doesn't affect my food, so whatever, I'll take it. Great date spot and BYO of course.",0.9762,0.784,0.146,0.07,0.5596969696969697

The flatbreads were a hit with the table, but the guys described them as toppings on tostitos. I loved both the eggplant and meat flatbreads, but to be fair to the guys the bread part was rather thin and flavorless. The chicken and waffles had a lot of potential, but the chicken was just too breaded. My table also sampled the french onion soup and the hummus platter without complaint. I believe only the cheese plate was met with lackluster reviews. The small plates are not small at all. Perfect for sharing between 3-4 people.

2012-12-28,4.0,"Bistro Dre is quite a bargain; the menu is a fusion of Parisian and contemporary American cuisine and best enjoyed tapas style (i.e. ordering a few dishes and sharing).  Dinner is served Wednesday through Sunday and brunch is available on the weekends as well. Tonight I dined with as a party of eight with my BYOB dinner club and everybody greatly enjoyed the meal. We ordered approximately ten savories (about half the menu) and all three desserts. While there was not a single dud, the lamb dish was my favorite of the night; nicely seared and a perfect medium rare. The flatbread with fennel sausage and Telaggio cheese was quite delicious as well and ranked as my second favorite dish. Bistro Dre is small and cozy, but a nice space. There is a lot going on with the decor (French paintings and artwork, tin ceilings, chandeliers, a bookshelf - even a book about Noma - the world's top restaurant, a couple red walls, some wood paneling, and most impressively the single stall men's room contains 19 framed pieces of art, two mirrors, three lights and a fuse ball table)! Despite the decor being busy, it works and there is a pleasant ambiance - perhaps the only knock being that the tables are a tad close together and the noise can become a tad on the loud side. As we had a largish party it is hard to evaluate service, but I certainly have no complaints. The owner (Chef Andre Christopher) is quite visible (always a good thing) and spent a few minutes chatting with our party at the conclusion of our meal. The food at Bistro Dre is the star; most of the dishes are quite hearty (i.e. meat wrapped in bacon, fish 'n chips, cheddar fondue mac n' cheese,  fried chicken with waffles, thick cut fries coated with truffle infused globs of  cheese and topped with brisket etc.) - not the place if you are looking to shed a few pounds, but a prime choice if you want richness and flavor. For the price the food is exquisite; complex yet tasty, well cooked and high quality ingredients. About the only knock on the food is that the menu is a tad on the small side and they were out of two of the four meat dishes and one of the two seafood dishes. Not sure if it had to do with this being the holiday season or if they were busier than normal, but as a fairly new venue I will give them a pass here - but this is something they must improve on going forward.  Adding to the already incredible value is the venue is BYOB. Both red and white wine stemware are provided as well as buckets to keep the whites cool. Another plus is desserts are accompanied by Black Dog Gelato, my favorite gelato in Chicagoland.  Our final tab came to a ridiculously low $21 per person (including tax and over 20% gratuity) and all of us left comfortably full. There are few venues in Chicago churning out food of this quality in this price range. Bistro Dre is a well above average venue in a very competitive Chicago food scene; their food appeals to a wide range of palates and I predict big things to come. They recently commenced accepting reservations on Open Table; they were quite busy tonight and if they can establish a Facebook presence and develop a website (it is hard to find much information online other than Yelp) they will really soar.",0.997,0.813,0.155,0.032,0.49084649310001427

Not that big of a deal. The serving staff seemed disorganized, brought us the wrong food, different servers throughout the night. There was one good server she had brown straight hair pulled back. The Food: Started with the cheese plate. For $14 we got about 6 pieces of bread the size of croutons, 4 or 5 tiny bites of apple, a little bit of cheese, and 4 small slices of meat. The presentation? looked like someone just dropped it all on a cutting board. Couldn't have given at least real pieces of bread? The apple that was cut up was probably 1/5 of an apple! Got the pierogies next, (im polish, so had to try them) these were the same pierogies that you buy for $4 at the grocery store, small and 6 of them. Cabbage with no flavor. Beans were only okay. Petite beef was okay, didn't expect it to be a stew. French fries were tasted good, but the fries were undercooked. Deep fried raw potatoes... awesome. Then we were excited for the cobbler. Horrible, didn't even finish it. Tasted like Thanksgiving hot cranberries.  I am not some grumpy food critic. My self and the others I dinned with definitely know our food though.

We were seated right away and given menus, which to be honest, are pretty disappointing (looking) after taking in the care that went into designing the rest of the aesthetics. They're printed in Times New Roman font on colored printer paper-- no bells and whistles, at all.  Regardless, the dishes on the menu did not disappoint. We ordered the cheese board, which was delicious, though I agree with another reviewer that slices of bread would've been more appropriate than the crouton-sized chunks. Next, my friend ordered the beet tartar which was fresh and a really beautiful presentation. We also shared the butternut squash mac & cheese and the fennel sausage flatbread. The only minor critique I'd have about the food was that the butternut squash was sliiiightly underdone, but otherwise everything was phenomenal. Not to mention, the menu states that plates are ""sharing plates"" which is usually code for ""tiny plates, hope you only want one bite of each thing."" Not so in this case-- the portions were quite generous, practically the size of a normal entree if you're not in the mood for sharing. Everything was delicious, and we all loved the rustic presentation on old-fashioned wooden cutting boards. The total bill was about ~$25/person including tip.

2012-10-21,4.0,"a great place to take vegetarian friends. we sometimes have trouble selecting a restaurant that will satisfy foodie vegetarians and vocarious meateaters (myself).  this place is perfect. all the entrees are upscale comfort food favorites, like chicken pot pie and meatloaf.  the small plates, though, are mainly veg.  the beet-stuffed beet was delicious and well-flavored.  the green beans, arancini, and frite were yummy also. a suggestion about the cheese board: the bread on it were the size of croutons; they need to be bigger.  also, i think it would be helpful to have the server explain the offerings on the board so that we knew what we were eating.  and so i wouldn't have shoved a crouton full of garlic in my mouth, thinking it was honey.     overall, though, a great first experience, and i will definitely be back.",0.9879,0.742,0.241,0.017,0.5047619047619046

2012-10-15,5.0,"We really enjoyed this little place. We expected more of a french bistro experience but as it turns out, their menu is more comfort food with a twist. We ordered the stuffed beet, the cheese platter and the meat loaf which was so flavorful (my kids nearly ate the whole thing by themselves). The service was great and very attentive. I love having a little bit of variety in this area and will continue to support them.",0.9732,0.761,0.239,0.0,0.5208333333333334
2012-10-14,5.0,"Love this place and its BYOB! Great food, atmosphere, service, and price. The owners (family-owned) were on the floor the entire night and stop to chat with us. They have so much passion for their business; the wife makes the desserts daily and their son is the chef.  We had a group of 5 and ordered around 8 dishes.  They were all fantastic! The bill was $27 including tip per person and we were stuffed by the end!  Our waitress was super friendly and on top of it. She never let our water glasses get empty and even worked with us on the timing of all the food. Also to note the place was pretty packed and she was still able to keep up.  As for the 1 bad review (Jon D), this place has only been open for 5 weeks. It's probably worth another shot as many places are working out the kinks in the beginning.",0.9737,0.788,0.169,0.042,0.5666666666666668

2012-09-29,5.0,"I like surprises, mostly, well sometimes and only when they're good. Flour and Water falls right into that. A great new find and surprise! I love to see people LOVE what they do and you can tell the chef here digs the craft. Very creative, interesting well thought out dishes. Food was excellent! Very nourishing as well, and just to pile on the goodness, very reasonably priced. There is nothing bad to say. This is how a neighborhood bistro should feel. WE LOVE IT! Get in here right away....BYOB, no corkage, woot, woot!!",0.9946,0.545,0.438,0.017,0.6514150432900432
2012-09-29,5.0,"I love finding a new gem to go eat!!!  When walking in the atmosphere is inviting and warm.  From the bright red walls, the expertly decorated bathroom, the perfect placement of coat/purse hooks, and the fresh flowers on the table, everything has been thought of to make dining here as pleasing to the eye as the food is to the palate.  It's a BYOB place with no uncorking fees!!!  The menu is ever changing, seasonal, and has a great variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes.  The dishes are topas style but big enough to let another person have a bite (if you're willing to share!!).  Everything is fresh and comes out as soon as it is ready to allow for the best flavor.  Dessert is to die for!!!  They are expanding their hours and have brunch as well; I definitely need to try that.  And with only being open a short time already have repeat customers; I know I'll be one of them!",0.9802,0.755,0.207,0.038,0.5363636363636364
2012-09-27,5.0,"I'm always looking for a new neighborhood spot, and I think i found it! The interior is very fun and inviting, and almost feels like you are in someones house. The decorations almost tell a story of a well lived life. Even though it hasn't been open long, it's always decently crowded when I walk past or go in. The staff are super friendly and always remember me when I come in. They are very helpful in navigating the menu, which can be a little overwhelming your first time, bu the staff is more than willing to guide you through it and make awesome suggestions. They have a cute little 'bar' seating area that is fun to sit at when I go there alone. I love that it's BYO with no corkage/opening fees!!  My favorite dish so far has been the bell peppers with goat cheese--- soooo delicious! They have a huge selection of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free items. I definitely need to go in and try their brunch!",0.9934,0.713,0.265,0.022,0.6232484848484848
