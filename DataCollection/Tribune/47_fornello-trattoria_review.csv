2015-09-08,3.0,"Reviews of this place and the main restaurant are polarizing. I knew I had to walk past it this evening, and I would see it often passing by, so I figured I would try it. I enjoy the general taste of pizza, so I'm an easy pizza date, and despite many negative reviews, I saw no reports of food poisoning, so I decided that trying a slice from Fornello's Express would be a at worst an appropriate snack. Sorry, for the serial commas. It was OK. First, for the price, it's pretty good. I've seen a lot of criticism of the cost of a slice; this one is $4.00 for a one-topping slice and a fountain drink which you will wisely top off during the 5-10 minute wait. Other jumbo slices without a drink are around this range. One topic of size... ... size is also OK. I wouldn't call it a jumbo slice, perhaps just a pretty large slice. Still, for the price and drink addition, this is an attractive deal. And taste... was also OK.  It just didn't have much depth. But it was an adequate combination of ample but dense cheese, kinda blandish thin crust and not much sauce. My recommendation for anyone getting an inexpensive slice like this is pepperoni; peps are hard to F--- up. Sausage was on the dry side.  Will I be back? probably; probably to try the main restaurant. Really easy thing to do for you, Fornello X, throw that slice under the broiler when someone orders pepperoni, so that the peps become crispy and turn into little grease cups.",0.953,0.839,0.119,0.041,0.5466205837173578

2015-01-23,2.0,"I lived right next to Fornello on Irving Park Road for about 3 years. Well, I actually lived right next to Byron's, which is right next to Fornello. You get the idea, I've given Fornello more than their fair share of opportunities to win me over.  Their staff is pretty inconsistent, sometimes you can get a super friendly and helpful server, and other times you can get a cranky server who has no interest in really helping you. They have a few people that just sit outside from time to time in the summer, and I'm not sure what their affiliation is with the restaurant, but they just sit there and talk to the staff. Very strange. Their food isn't bad. It isn't great either. It's certainly not something that's worth their prices, as a dinner for two and a couple drinks or wine can really add up here. I have absolutely no problem footing a big bill for a nice meal with great service, however Fornello doesn't (consistently) provide either of those things. They do have two really nice things. 1.) In the summer they have a rather large and nice patio. There's probably 8 to 12 tables on the patio, it's covered, and nicely decorated. There's also great people watching, which is an absolute must for me when sitting on a patio. This is a prime location for Cubs traffic as well as people coming and going from the Sheridan Redline, so there's no shortage of foot traffic. 2.) Their bread is delivered fresh daily. I know this because I would walk past it every single day and I saw the bread being delivered each day. Their bread is really good, I will say that. All in all, I really wish I could give Fornello more than two stars, I really do. But, I've given them at least 10 opportunities to change the way I feel, and honestly I'm not sure why I gave them so many chances. Probably because I lived right there and nothing beats convenience.  The only circumstance where I'd say it's worth stopping in would be if you're already in the area, there's a spot to sit on the patio, and all you want is a drink and a snack (their bread).

2014-07-03,1.0,"I have ordered delivery from them quite a few times and, no joke, they would screw up one or more of the items I would order about 75% of the time. In their defense, they would usually address it appropriately if I called to complain, but no matter how clear I placed my order, I would usually not get what I ordered and the ""I'm sorry's"" got really old. The last two times I ordered from Fornello's were to final nails in the coffin so to speak.  Well, my last delivery was the pizza margarita. I ordered it with extra cheese this time b/c they never put enough cheese on it. Well, the pic speaks for itself. Got charged extra but didn't get any extra cheese. When 1/3 of the pizza is just tomato sauce, you didn't put extra or even enough cheese on it. Paid extra too. Called and was told the manager would call me back. Of course he never did. Ignorant.   The second to the last time I ordered from them, I ordered a side salad, minestrone soup and pasta.  When ordering my salad, I specifically said that I only wanted romaine lettuce & requested that they add mushrooms & crumbled blue cheese (for an additional charge of course).  Well, the picture shows what they delivered to me. All head lettuce with literally one or two cherry tomatoes and one cucumber. That was it. The picture says it all (the two cherry tomatoes were hidden under the head lettuce). But literally, that is all that was on it. They, of course, charged me extra for the crumbled blue cheese that I never got. Now onto the minestrone soup. I kid you not, it tasted like vinegar or lemon or something. It was the WORST minestrone soup I have ever eaten. It was pretty much inedible. Totally bitter. And look at the picture I posted. They served my soup with a whole tomato in the soup! How in the world do you not cut up a tomato when adding tomatoes to the stock of minestrone soup?? I also ordered the Cappelacci di Zucca but requested that they use the sauce for the Bow Tie Pasta dello Chef. I even said, ""you know. The balsamic cream sauce that has the sundried tomatoes and mushrooms in it."" Got it delivered with balsamic cream but just chunks of pumpkin in the sauce. Way too much gourd going on! They messed that up too. Basically everything I ordered was bad and/or wrong. I stopped ordering their entree sized salads a long time ago b/c they were always such a disappointment. This is how their entree sized salads go. 20% of the salad is made with the lettuce that they tell you that they will make it with, 60% is made with head lettuce, which is not mentioned at all in the description of the salad and the other 20% is about only 1/3 of the toppings that you would reasonably expect to get on an entree salad of that size. It's a container of head lettuce with a little good stuff mixed in a bit. You get a bunch of head lettuce even when the menu says the salad comes with romaine or mixed greens. But of course, the menu makes it sound like the salad will be a beautiful mixed greens salad with a lot of toppings and then you open up the container & the majority of the lettuce is head lettuce with about two cherry tomatoes, two cucumbers and two artichokes and one or two olives. That's it! That's their LARGE salad. One time I called to complain that I ordered a salad with mixed green, not head lettuce, and the guy told me that next time I call for delivery I should tell him that I don't want any head lettuce. You have GOT to be kidding me. Oh... I'm sorry... I thought if I ordered a specific salad by name & that salad is listed on your menu by that specific name & the menu clearly describes with great detail all the ingredients of the salad & that it is made with ""mixed greens"" & the description makes mention of no other lettuce, then I, the customer, should not have the burden to have to order the salad by saying, ""I would like the XYZ salad but I don't want any head lettuce or romaine lettuce or bibb lettuce or boston lettuce or red leaf lettuce or Escarole lettuce or baby spinach leaves or..."" and proceed to describe all the different things on the planet that I don't want put into my salad. I have a better idea Einstein - how about your restaurant actually makes the salads and food the way the menu says your restaurant is going to make the salads and food?? That should clear things up. It will be really streamlined that way. Plus, that way, your menus will actually serve a purpose and be relevant to orders! Eureka! What a great idea! Just think of your menu as your chefs' guides to inform the chefs of what the customer wants made for them. Brilliant concept, huh? Why would it ever be my burden as a customer to tell you to make the salad the way your menu says your restaurant serves the salad?!? Ahhhhh... it wouldn't be. Ever. Ciao Fornello.

2014-04-23,4.0,"I'm really surprised to see all the negative reviews, Fornello hit the spot for us. We came in late on a Saturday and were probably 1 of 5 tables occupied at about 9pm. The décor of the restaurant was new-looking and accommodating, unlike some very similar places that are dated and cram all diners together like sardines, despite serving the same type of cuisine. The 80's-sounding Italian music was fitting at first, but after about an hour, we grew a bit tired of it. Nick, our server, was probably the best waiter I've had in months. He was friendly, knowledgeable, funny, and went out of his way to get us what we wanted and make our experience great, even at a seemingly unwelcoming time of 9pm. Questions were answered in great detail, recommendations given, check-ups regular, and yet it didn't seem like he was hovering or rushing us in the least bit.  The bread with red sauce and cheese was surprisingly tasty, even after I had my doubts that there was no traditional olive oil to be found on the table. We started with bruschetta, and did pay the upcharge for added prosciutto, which was worth it, and I highly recommend it. Next, salads all around. 2 Caesars and one caprese, which were all monstrous, we probably should have just gotten 2 total salads for our group of 3. The Caesars were delicious, not under or over dressed, complete with what tasted like homemade croutons and fresh parm shavings. The caprese was simple, yet good. I have a weak spot for fresh and thick mozzarella cheese, commonly found in caprese.  Next, I ordered a drink. Can't recall the name, but it was of the martini/cocktail variety that I believe contained gin, berries, mint and chocolate, but it tasted similar to a sweet coconut. This was just fair, and I'm not sure it was quite worth the $10+ I paid for it. Probably should have gotten some vino instead.  Even after bruschetta and salad, we ordered our own entrees. The veal marsala was pretty good and very tender, sauce was even better. My friend's Brick chicken was also a pleasant surprise. He opted to pay over $25 for the whole bird, and planned on taking some home. The sauce was quite flavorful, and the chicken cooked perfectly, and seasoned well with a crispy outside and tender inside. Our waiter kindly bagged up the rest at the end of the meal, gave him specific reheating instructions, and even had the chef cook up a special batch of extra sauce at no cost! Awesome. Lastly, I opted for one of the signature/special dishes which was stuffed gnocchi. I get this at most Italian places, its one of my favorite dishes whether it be cheese or potato stuffed or with pesto/other sauce. Fornello's stuffed gnocchi contained asiago cheese and was topped with a brandy butter sauce. I opted to add grilled chicken as well, which was a pretty good decision, otherwise my entire entrée would have been a bit mushy in consistency. The gnocchi were cooked perfectly, and the sauce had some great bite to it. The fusion of asiago and brandy with the grilled chicken was a great combination. The sauce did seem a bit powerful at times, but nothing that warranted a complaint or negative feedback. After we had finished gorging, a friend opted for a bizarre 10pm cup of coffee. I know this probably isn't the most crucial item to judge at Fornello, but he reported that the coffee was terrible, and didn't finish it. Maybe that's what you get for ordering coffee at 10pm at an Italian restaurant, maybe you other yelpers should avoid the coffee altogether? I'm not exactly sure.  Now for the bill. We discussed with Nick how we wanted the bill split up, and he made sure it was correct before bringing it. Most hasty servers aren't this careful, and the level of communication was very assuring, making the financial aspect of our meal painless, despite our confusing splits. Overall, I give Fornello 4 solid stars. The service stood out the most to us and I wish Nick could be my server at every restaurant I go to. The food was tasty, but just a tad bit pricey, and the drink also didn't impress me with a sticker price of over $10. These are the primary reasons for subtracting a star, along with the fact that I seldom give 5 star ratings, as the experience has to be textbook perfect to deserve a perfect rating. This is a solid neighborhood Italian place that shouldn't disappoint you, and I'm sure we will be in again.",0.9992,0.743,0.2,0.057,0.5476925731273556

2013-10-03,1.0,"The people who own and run Fornello are perfectly good people and I mean no harm to them personally, but I have to write honestly or else they may not change their misguided ways. The high-top where we sat outside under the heater on the patio was pleasant. Our server was a nice woman who asked for our drink orders and brought us very good bread and a little ramekin of red sauce. The sauce was good - off to a good start. I was thinking about wine, or maybe beer and then I noticed they had something called a martini flight for $13 so I chose that. For dinner, we ordered the baked clams to start and we split the gnocchi special - potato gnocchi in a butter and sage sauce with pine nuts and butternut squash - and a side of rapini. And then, in an instant, our good expectations began to evaporate.  About 3 minutes after taking our order, 4 mini martini glasses that reeked of every regretful night in college and tasted like a melted popsicle diluted with Aristocrat arrived on the table. They glowed like highlighters in a black light. When our clams came, they were mounded with bread crumbs and arranged in a coagulated butter and garlic sauce slick. One decent, albeit bready clam in, Erynn made a face usually reserved for an encounter with a heavily used porta-potty. The clams were sandy and rubbery with overtones of sea-bottomy flavor; the type of rubbery that makes food perpetually expand in your mouth as you chew. 0 for 2 for the night.  As they took away our shells, our waitress asked about my martini flight. ""It's not exactly...what I expected"" I said, trying to be polite but honest. ""But they're specialties! They're a little different! They're fun!"" She shot back. I'd offended her. I didn't push. It wasn't her fault they weren't what I wanted. So the mini glasses sat and glowed at me, untouched. Dinner arrived. First, a shallow dish of badly overcooked, minced broccoli rabe. It tasted like it was seasoned only with the mop water it was boiled in.  Then our plate of obviously up-until-recently-frozen rubber bullets with soggy sage leaves, scorched pine nuts and scattered with hard chips of butternut squash that must have been prepared using a wood chipper was coated in a flavorless slime that was closer to Vaseline than anything edible.  Nothing had salt.  I've had plenty of bad meals in my life, but the difference with Fornello was price. For this spectacular example of carelessness, we ended up dishing out nearly $50 plus tip. It could have been a bad night. Maybe the chef didn't show up or they didn't get a delivery or something, but this experience has set me off of Fornello forever. On a positive note, our waitress did give us 2 free drink cards for our next visit.  If I start to hear better things about this place, I'll try it again.

For one thing, it sure seemed to me like the menu hadn't changed an iota since when I first frequented this place back around 2008.  I mean, I understand that every restaurant has their signature dishes and all, but I'd think you'd want to at least rotate your appetizers and a few of your entrees, to keep things new and interesting. Fornello's has a vibe like it may have been trendy or good a long time ago, but everything has gotten somewhat tired or stale since then. In my opinion, the food here is very expensive for what you get, especially when you have such a quality local Italian place like Pizza Rustica around the corner, who make their own pasta and pizzas from scratch for a lot less.  I'm also just not that impressed with the overall food quality at Fornello's.  I mean, Fornello's does offer a lot of veal dishes, and some classic wine-based chicken selections, but they come across as rather pretentious as compared to what they really are, which is really a rather mediocre, overpriced sit-down Italian place.

Alas, my search for authentic East Coast or Neapolitan pizza delivered to north Edgewater continues unrequited.  I adore Jimmy's, but they don't deliver more than a1/2 mi. radius from Lincoln & Foster. Apart almost makes the grade, but for the inexplicably solid outer crust. Piece won't deliver this far north and Coalfire not at all. So it was between Pizza DOC and Fornello, It came down to size (DOC's is too small to make delivery worthwhile) and my memories of having had Fornello's wonderful frutta di mare pizza 20 years ago: cut into wedge-shaped slices with that indefinable balance of thin and resilient crust. First couple of Yelp reviews that mentioned the pizza still extolled it, so I took the plunge. Props for prompt delivery, which saved this review from being one star. The aroma emerging from the insulated delivery bag was quite promising, but was the promise fulfilled? Feh (""meh"" is too generous). Probably the second-worst pizza I've had in Chicago (and I've lived here nearly 35 years), almost as bad as Pete's. At least it was filling and I didn't break a tooth on the crust. Imagine my disappointment as I opened the box and saw those stupid little squares into which inauthentic pizzaiolas (and I use the term loosely) in this town feel compelled to hack with a chef's knife so you can't tell exactly how much you've eaten (a dealbreaker for dieters).  The crust was denser around the edge than Apart but dry and burnt---and tasted like unsalted Saltines or hardtack. I've done better using store-bought dough. Not even the equal of frozen from Target. Gave me very bad flashbacks of Shakey's in small-town Washington State. I expect a ""margherita"" pizza to have tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and a decent amt. of basil. Strikeout on all three counts: rubbery dried mozz, bland canned sauce, and a couple of shreds of basil as an afterthought (with a couple of black olives, which I didn't order).

It's definitely not the same as pastas in Italy, but for Lakeview, it's pretty good. Portions were huge, too.  The service was very nice and polite.

2012-03-10,1.0,"The pizza is solid, most of the other things are not (either over priced or sub par or both) If I was rating Fornello solely on its cuisine it would be somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. The customer service is 1 star and their neighborhood presence is downright offensive. I used to live on the same block so I frequently ordered the pizza. More than once they told me 20 minutes and I would arrive 25 minutes later.  I would stand at the pick up window and have no one take notice I was there until I flagged someone down.  Then I would be told that they didn't have the pizza ready and to come back in another 20 minutes....they hadn't even started it yet!, this happened about one in three times. Good thing I lived right down the block or I would have been waiting there alone until it was ready.  My other beef is that they block the alleyway with their deliverymen and screw over the people that live on the block.  Again more than once I pulled in off Irving Park road to find 2 or 3 cars parked in my way. When I asked them to move they just ignored me,  these guys are always there too, many times I was forced to call the police on them  to open up the alleyway, they couldn't have cared less about the neighborhood they operate in.

2012-02-18,1.0,"Try to avoid ordering on a Saturday night, you will be on hold for quite a while. Substitutions are not accommodated either. The employees on the phone are very short and vague with descriptions and don't seem to care about customer service. This is all great if you want a speedy order, or hate talking to random people on the phone who you don't trust with your food. They are quick to hang up, but then again it is Saturday night and I understand that it is busy. But is it hard to say, ""thank you"" or ""bye""? I don't think so.  The employees on the phone know very little of the menu. Like they grabbed a bus boy to pick up the phone. Every time I asked a question he had to put me on hold to go get information about my question. ""How many is in this?"" ""Give me a second..."" ""Can you sub balsamic for red sauce?"" ""Give me a second..."" I'd like to place an order for delivery."" ""Give me a second..."" ""How are you this evening?"" ""Give me a second..."" It was too much to handle and I became frustrated. Of course that's not the order in which it happened, but that was generally the conversation. Vague City. I only hope this is because of the time period we ordered and not the everyday experience.  We got the food fairly fast, they had said an hour and it took about 40 minutes. I give them credit there for the fast delivery. With that being said, they had acknowledged a coupon I had and said it was applied to the order when my card was processed. Looking at the receipt the delivery guy gave me the total which read the original price, no coupon. The driver had to call his boss and confirm that the coupon would be applied, this took about 5 minutes and was very tedious passing the phone back and forth.  The food, oh my god the food. My girlfriend had ordered the linguini with calamari, and it had to be the worst calamari I have ever tried. Very over-cooked and chewy, like they chop the ears off of bad employees or people who give this place bad reviews and create makeshift ""calamari"" (watch out). It was an absolute chore eating them. Paying the money for a dish only to have the main ingredient inedible? Red flag. Absolutely terrible. I ordered a meatball sub, I will say that it was pretty good because how can you fuck that up? I'm very surprised they didn't.  The only satisfaction I got out of this meal was bashing it right now on Yelp. Stay away. There are far better italian places in the area.

Unlike some of the other reviews I read before going to Fornello, we had a great experience. First, it's very easy to get to, just steps of the Sheridan red line stop. Our waitress was kind and attentive, but never pushy. They had a great list of special pasta dishes and my boyfriend and I both selected our meals from that list, on a plain 8x11 piece of paper tucked inside the regular menu.  I had the linguini Alfredo herb and it was very tasty! I highly recommend it if it is still around when you go there. Liguini noodles in a cream sauce that was very light compared to other Alfredo dishes I've had, plus tender chicken, asparagus, and cherry tomatoes. My only complaint is that I wished there was more asparagus because it was SO good. I saw other reviews that praised the asparagus salad, so asparagus is apparently something Fornello does well. It was a huge portion, and I have enough at home for lunch today and possibly even dinner again if I wanted! My boyfriend wasn't as satisfied, but he also decided to be a little more adventurous and tried the canneoli di carne, which is basically a lot of meat stuffed into giant noodles and smothered with meat sauce and cheese. He was thinking it would taste similar to lasagna, but the meat had a different texture that neither of us were crazy about and he mentioned there was too much cheese for his liking.

We had heaps of leftovers because of the misdirection but when he brought the leftovers back to us, they had been cut in half.  I was too pissed to complain.  It then took me getting our coats on, and standing by the register for him to understand that we also needed our check.   I am a minimum 20% tipper on my worst days because I worked my tail off serving tables and behind a bar while I was building a career.  I respect the profession and those who choose it.  Maybe he was having an off day.  Maybe he was irritated by having a woman and her toddler at his table.  The service was unacceptable.  ABSOLUTELY unacceptable.

The flavors were decadent but not quite sharp enough - I would have liked a bit more sage; a more pronounced savory element to the dish in general. The mozzarella cheese sticks could have been cooked a tad longer as the cheese wasn't gooey, melty and stretchy (told you I was looking for comfort). But the cannoli... oh, the cannoli! Spot-on, every last morsel.  Fornello definitely deserves another shot - next time a craving for Italian strikes, I'll stick to my usual plan of action: A pasta in some type of tomato cream sauce. And of course - don't forget the cannoli. You can never forget the cannoli!",0.9145,0.826,0.107,0.067,0.4504884004884005

However I have 2 major grievances: the food, like I already mentioned and the delivery driver. The food: 1. buffalo wings: Yes it was huge. Each wing has the drummet and the wing, so it was the equivalent of 2 wings. but there were still hairs left on the wings.  But 40 terrible wings is still 40 TERRIBLE, hairy wings. 2. the fried chicken had no flavor. Literally eating the fried skin tasted like eating crunchy fried shoebox 3. Even the Italian sausage had no flavor. Is that possible?!  4. The only things that were decent were the french fries, onion rings and the jalapeño poppers. The Delivery Driver: Showed up within an hour like promised which is great but when he showed up he had no change. Like none. He had 2 $20s and 2 singles. How can ANY delivery driver, make deliveries (AND ON SUPERBOWL SUNDAY) without change?! He left me with all the food, in my sweatshirt, in 6 feet of snow, in -20 degree weather while he ran around from store to store begging for change.  Ugh...NO-NOT COOL",0.8553,0.79,0.124,0.086,0.5953703703703703

2011-01-11,4.0,"I'd really rather give this a 3.5 star rating than 4 . . . here's why. I met two friends for an early weeknight dinner. The restaurant was pretty much empty except for us. So, I can't complain about the service! Well, not much, anyway. The waitress was probably bored until we showed up. She wasn't terrifically friendly or engaging, just very businesslike. A welcoming smile would have been nice, but we didn't get that. We did get everything we ordered in a timely manner, but we would have gotten the same thing if we'd ordered through a computer. Maybe she warmed up as the evening progressed and more people came in - but we weren't around to see that. As a former restaurant employee, I think I should at least get a friendly hello from the wait staff, and I didn't get that here. The place is very cute. I would like to be there sometime when other diners are present. It's hard to tell how a restaurant operates when you're sitting at the only occupied table. I was still looking at the menu when my friends' pasta dinners arrived. OMG, the portions are HUGE!! There were enough there to feed a small country for a year (slight exaggeration only). If you think the prices on a pasta dish are a tad high, remember that you'll get a couple lunches out of it, at least. One friend had spaghetti with carbonara sauce, and the other had the radiatori giardinetto. I had a taste of both, and they were delicious. The radiatori eater thought it was a little too spicy, but I thought it was just right. That kind of pasta should have a little spiciness to it. And the carbonara was creamy and delicious. I knew that I did not want to be eating pasta for the next week, so I ordered the large caesar salad. This was one of the odder caesars I've ever had. The dressing was spread over the top in concentric circles, like the rings on a bull's-eye target. And there didn't seem to be any croutons. It was a salad, but not a caesar. Still, I ate the whole thing, and it was the right amount for me. They seem to have parking places, but I found a free spot on Irving Park Road, only about a half block away. That sort of thing always adds to my dining experience. They did have a wine list. I was the only one drinking (not the first time that's happened). I had a glass of cabernet, and it was very good. My friends were drinking coffee.  There was way too much food to arouse an interest in dessert, even for me. Wine is usually my dessert anyway. Bottom line: I'd try it again.",0.9955,0.819,0.147,0.034,0.5281944444444443

Food: Ordered Bruschetta, grilled calamari and caprese salad, with a glass of wine. I had to remind our server to actually bring me the glass of wine, and when it arrived, it was bordering on hot, as is the bottle had been on top of the dishwasher, or something extremely hot. Not an ideal temperature to serve a red wine at.  I can quickly sum up the impression of the food. Extremely average. The tomatoes in the caprese were not flavorful, nor was the bruschetta mixture anything special. Maybe tomatoes arent in season now? But these tomatoes were waxy, and flavorless. I expect to find tomatoes like this at Jewel, but not at an Italian restaurant. The grilled calamari had a slight fishy, less than fresh flavor to it, although the sauce it had prepared in was strong enough to mask this until you really started eating the calamari.  One of our guests found a piece of plastic in her food, and was told it was for microwaving the dish? Forgetting to remove it was incredibly sloppy, but also learning that they had to microwave her dish was an even bigger disappointment.

Now, this was my first time ever having it (not just from Fornelllo's) and I found it to be the perfect sweet and savory combo. It also traveled well.  The chocolate cake was moist, rich and cured my chocolate craving (for the night). The cheesecake was really tasty (I stole a bite) but for the price, I was expecting a bigger piece.  The not so good: the sauce in the cheese ravioli was runny/watery. While my husband didn't think the dish was bad, I prefer a thick, chunky sauce and this didn't do it for me. The cheese sticks were nothing special.  They tasted like a box of frozen ones you'd buy at the grocery store. When you order $25 + for delivery, you get the option of a free item.  I wish we'd picked something else! I know I would absolutely get the pumpkin ravioli again whether we dine-in or get delivery and I'd be interested in trying out some other dishes.",0.9891,0.757,0.179,0.064,0.648639455782313

I found Fornello Trattoria and liked the fact they were a couple blocks away from me. I ordered 14"" Pan Fornello Special (your choice of any 6 toppings).  The delivery time was accurate, the pizza was steaming hot. The pizza is great!! Fresh toppings (I had some veggies and a meat). The cheese was nicely melted and stringy, not a single mass of grease.  I believe the pizza is all in the crust; the crust was neither too hard or soft, it had a perfect bite.  Toppings to crust was proportional.  Fornello Trattoria simply serves a great pizza loaded with quality toppings and a perfect crust. I will order from them again and I recommend.",0.979,0.786,0.188,0.025,0.6478495270161937

The last time I dined at Fornello, it took 45 minutes for our appetizer and our server was far from attentive. There were four of us, and all of our meals came out at different times. When the server didn't even go so far as to apologize or acknowledge that we were unhappy, I asked to speak with the manager who ended up being the owner. The owner was stand-offish, rude, and told me that it wasn't their fault for being so busy and having a backed-up kitchen (There were literally only seven sat tables in the entire place). I worked in the restaurant industry as a server for years, and I know when a restaurant is slammed and they were far from it.

He said he would be eating it for breakfast this morning, in fact. I didn't try his pizza but the pesto on it smelled fresh and like pesto awesomeness.  I was torn about what to order. In another review I mentioned that I'm just shy of being a pumpkin junkie. I LOVE pumpkin almost everything (except pumpkin burgers. that just went awry in all kinds of ways). Fornello had TWO pumpkin-related pasta options: pumpkin ravioli that had a white cream sauce and sun-dried tomatoes AND cappelaci di zucca with a pumpkin ricotta filling, pine nuts and butternut squash in a brown butter sauce. What's a girl to do? Not wanting to eat a heavy cream sauce, I went for the capellaci. GOOOOD choice. The pasta was fresh and the filling was flavorful. I'm not sure how brown the butter was--it didn't taste like other brown butter sauces I've had and it was in a black container. The pine nuts and butternut squash were the perfect compliment to the pasta.

Nonetheless, Fornello's continues to be my preferred Italian restaurant, until someone convinces me otherwise.  Situated around the corner from the Sheridan red line stop, Rachel Ray took time out of her schedule to notice Fornello's existence, giving praise to their pizzas. Surprisingly, I haven't tried their pizzas yet, but they're on my list of things to eat! I have partaken in the pastas numerous times, and recommend any pasta involving seafood or prosciutto. I just wish that Fornello's would bring back the special dish that I had on the night I first dined here: cup-shaped pasta with prosciutto and shrimp, in a white wine sauce. MMM! I've also enjoyed their salmon risotto, though it doesn't keep well as leftovers. I wasn't terribly impressed with the eggplant parmigiana, especially since the accompanying pasta was bland. The portions are large and unless you're voracious, you will be taking leftovers home. You can also split dishes with your friends but they charge a splitting fee. As for desserts, the sorbets are delicious and come in their original fruit shells. I settled on the sorbet because half of the dessert menu was unavailable at the time, thus disappointing my crave for some tiramisu. As for ambiance, Fornello's is best by candlelight on a Friday or Saturday evening. Yes, some have complained it's too dark, but I've tried dining here around 6 pm on a weekday and felt like I was in a diner because there were so many regulars. Besides, the restaurant's frescoes garner their full effect in twilight. Also note that during the summer, al fresco dining is available.",0.9882,0.796,0.157,0.047,0.45416666666666666

I was about to start my late evening looong commute home when I thought, ""oh! a nice, warm restaurant visit will make it all the more bearable!"" And I'm so glad I stopped in, for it was to begin a love affair.  My first visit was solo at the bar by their fireplace/oven. I had their Lobster-Zucchini stuffed pasta, a little spicy, creamy, AMAZING!!!!! I paired it with an Italian beer. I've since had their food catered to my office, and gone back with various groups of dining companions. Any you know? Every time I order the same thing: the lobster-zucchini stuffed pasta dish. THE BEST! In fact, everyone at my work loved it, and once our Italian waitress said it was her favorite menu item! I've come to this restaurant with a 1st generation Italian friend of mine, who says the place is great- the real thing. She says some of the dishes are traditional things her mom will make, and that this place is right on. This has to count for something! Yes, true, the wine is pricey... but they have good wine! Split one bottle with friends and it adds a worthy touch to the meal.  In sum: nice staff, nice interior, great food. I suppose some menu items are better than others- but if you go... get the lobster-zucchini pasta dish- trust!!

Setting is intimate: dark with candles and tiny tables. Big groups are welcome and I think they might deliver as well.

2009-05-24,1.0,"All I can say was that we had a super strange dinner experience, and the food and price weren't worth the headaches. When we arrived we stood awkwardly in the front area until someone finally noticed us--there's a bar, and the restaurant, but not really a foyer or anywhere to wait to be seated.  Once we were seated, the older waiter (who was probably the manager/owner due to his age/apparent power) kept telling us he'd be with us in a minute. At least 20 minutes passed before he even took our drink orders and at that point we knew what we wanted to eat as well.  The menu was limited, to say it nicely, and everything seemed over-priced.  To save money, I opted for a salad and then an appetizer of either the clams or mussels, depending on what he recommended.  Firstly, I asked for the dressing on the side.   He said ""oh, we don't do that here"" and assured me it was very light, but when it came it was swimming in vinegar.  Yuck.  I could barely eat it.  Then I asked which he preferred of either the clam or mussel appetizer and he said 'neither--we are out!'.  I asked if this meant they also couldn't do the seafood risotto (my third choice) and he said he'd make it with salmon and shrimp instead of the mussels and clams. Much to my surprise, my meal came out with plenty of mussels and clams!  Sure, that sounds good, but I wanted an appetizer that was only $10 and I ended up paying $19 for the risotto dish.  Don't you think he should have told me???  At least the portions were huge so I have a second meal. Also, when they brought our wine they had spilled it all over the stems and bases of the wine glasses, dripping red wine on both the table and our plates every time we picked them up.  Very odd. I felt kind of guilty thinking negatively of the place, though, because there was a woman with a voice more grating than Fran Drescher's in the corner demanding a reduced bill because ""the food was mediocre and the service sucked.""  I wasn't going to be that confrontational, but I have to say I agreed. The final straw came with dessert, when we ordered gelato.  IT CAME IN A PLASTIC CONTAINER--I KID YOU NOT.  I guess we should have taken the hint when only a portion of their desserts said 'homemade' but I never suspected high school cafeteria style gelato.  Sure it tasted ok, but six bucks for a plastic carton?  I have expected a wooden stick-spoon to eat it with. Needless to say, we will seek out better Italian than Fornello's.  And I won't trust Rachel Ray in the future. P.S. The brick oven was a-blazing but I saw NO PIZZA anywhere on the menu.  Ciao, Fornello's!  Have a nice life.",0.9732,0.842,0.1,0.058,0.5311943476577623

If there were indeed four cheeses as advertised, it sure didn't taste like it.  I got a mere hint of gorgonzola on one bite. Had there been more sauce and a better mix of cheese, it would have been good. Finally, the man who took my order over the phone was brusque almost to the point of discourtesy.

Sure. Oh, nice, more bread because we're waiting. So we waited. It was nearly an hour before we got our food. Note, no salad nor soup was offered, which was a disappointment given the amount of time we needed to wait. My rotini carbonara was a generous portion to be sure, one that served well as a leftover lunch in addition to dinner. The flavor? It was good, I'll admit, but nothing spectacular. The rotini was done very well, and the sauce was solid but not sock-knocking. There were ""Italian bacon"" bits here as well (prosciutto?) that gave a little more interest and texture to the dish. I probably would have been better served by even adding some pepper to make this more interesting. The prices are high given the lack of soup or salad and the slightly-above-basic-ness of the dishes.

I deducted 1 star for my experience last night.....stick to the pizza for now....maybe I will try the pasta dishes.",0.9736,0.799,0.174,0.027,0.6118170426065163
2007-04-23,2.0,"UPDATE REVIEW... JULY 9... They are getting damn freeking cheap, from cutting out stuff in salads to using really lame chicken breasts in the Limone Chicken. I have moved on. The pizza is good, but that is now the ONLY thing I would order from here",-0.2952,0.849,0.041,0.109,0.8357142857142856
2007-02-09,4.0,"This place isn't as classy as they try to be- I was very surprised when I saw a sign on their door announcing that Rachel Ray's Tasty Travels would be filming there. The food is good, and seems authentic (-no Fettucini Alfredo here-) but the place is kind of tacky and a little expensive for the experience. I was there a little late and I got the feeling that they wanted me to leave soon, so I did. I have ordered for pick up a few times now, and I feel better about this place. The food is always tasty, hot and quick. I definitely recommend it for pick-up, just not a romantic date night.",0.8766,0.81,0.139,0.051,0.6266666666666667
2007-02-06,1.0,"We got food to go and when we got it home there were ants in the bread they had given us.  Gross!  We called and went back in to show them and instead of apologizing they said that it could not have come from their restaurant like that. It was awful!  I lived nearby and had been a regular customer for a couple of years and that really turned me off.  Not the ants (although gross) but the way the manger dismissed me as crazy, like I had put them there myself.  I haven't been back.",-0.4374,0.86,0.051,0.09,0.2721153846153846
2007-01-25,4.0,"Ok, there's two different sides to this place - there's the actual restaurant and then there's another door to the right of the main one that you can get pizza by the slice from.   I've only eaten at the restaurant once and it was pretty good.  But the pizza by the slice I've had at least 30 times and it's SO GOOD.  They load it with the toppings of your choice, and by load I mean make a mountain with them.  I always get green peppers and mushrooms and it's pretty much the best pizza I've ever had.  Don't get plain cheese.",0.9655,0.819,0.181,0.0,0.5321056547619049
2006-12-16,1.0,"I have been a regular at this restaurant for over 5 years. My husband and I had our first date there and I have sung their praises to other foodies. This is why I feel betrayed, violated, and abused. After a extensive meal last night, there was some confusion over a gift certificate. When we asked to speak to a manager, I was escorted to a backroom where I was verbally attacked. The ""gentleman"" accused me of being a ""cheap scammer"" along with a string of other profanity laced insults. I have been in this industry for over 15 years, and I am sensitive to those individuals that try to take advantage of particular offers. The manager did not inquire to the specifics of the situation, but rather chose to falsely accuse me and my husband. I was so upset last night that I became ill. I have never been treated so poorly. My only solace is to warn others of this vitriolic man. I hope the neighborhood will avoid this one time favorite until it is run under new management. What a waste of excellent mussels.",-0.9285,0.727,0.092,0.18,0.4786001036001035
2006-11-15,2.0,"I've only had take out from this place, so the review is going to be based solely on the food. The Pumpkin ravioli was okay,  but the sauce tasted like it was missing something. When I called, the staff was fairly friendly so that's a plus.",0.7351,0.772,0.174,0.054,0.5125
2006-11-14,3.0,"My husband and I ate here on a Friday early evening. Upon entering, you're impressed by the brick oven that you're facing which is built into the wall, and serves absolutely no purpose. The dining room is small, and the tables are uneven (as is the flooring) the dining chairs are of the metal fold up variety, which I find tacky with white top tables. I ordered a glass of Chianti (which was sour and returned for a Cabernet) and my husband had a beer.  My entree was the Veal and spinach stuffed ravioli in a saffron and butter sauce. The pasta was undercooked, and the filling was a little bitter, but the sauce was EXCELLENT. My husband had the chicken with Artichokes and a side of pasta in a marinara sauce, which he said was just so so although we both agreed that his sauce was terrific too. We had a bland tiramisu for dessert, and our total bill came to $80.00. I would not return to this restaurant because it lacks any ambiance. I feel that the dining room was cold as was our server, and the food simply could not make up for that.",0.9313,0.898,0.084,0.018,0.6053221288515407

2006-05-01,5.0,"My favorite place for dinner in our area, hands down! Not always what I want to spend to stuff my face but great for a night out thats not too pricey.  (approx $11-15 an entree). The wine is amazing and the caprese salad is something I crave on a constant basis. Good patio in the summer too! The restaurant itself has a very authentic feel to it with waiters who clearly only speak English as a second language. The only complaint is the seats by the window where across the street is a carnival like sign for the local Mexican joint. This flashing colorful sign may make induce epileptic fits.  My advice be the first in and push other dining companions out of the way so you can sit facing the restaurant and not the carnival across the street. Yum enjoy!!!",0.9823,0.792,0.191,0.018,0.4808641975308642
