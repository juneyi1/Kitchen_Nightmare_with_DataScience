We thought it'd be great since they had more options. First problem came when the menus had no sides listed as paleo. The waiter was helpful when explaining what was and wasn't but the options were a little too limited. I ordered one beef skewer and the stuffed mushrooms. The meat came out warm and with not much flavor. Disappointing for $17. The main problem came at the end of the evening when I presented my Groupon I had bought. They took it back on my phone and took off $50 from the bill. However, Groupon had made a text mistake since it should have been for $25. Now here is where I am upset, I in no way needed all $50 off. What I  am upset about is that they brought the check out said they had taken 50 off, which I said wow to and then left. Then they come back in a frenzy and ripped the check off the table saying there is a huge mistake and that it's only $25. It was completely embarrassing and totally unprofessional. They should have checked before placing the check at my table. They made me and my friends feel like we had done something wrong. It was just bad business. Because of this, I won't be back.

We had the sirloin, bacon wrapped dated, and mahi mahi. The beef was a tiny bit dry, but the sauces worked to even it out. My favorite was the dates, because well bacon.

Clearly something went wrong at some point. The food was okay for the most part but is WAY overpriced. Like 1.5 times the amount it should cost. Seriously, $20 for four grilled shrimp with drawn butter? $15 for a flatbread? $8.00 for ""creamed corn"" that was clearly frozen corn dumped in tasteless and heavy cream sauce? (No excuse for that shit during corn season and with so many other places offering amazing elotes). Most dishes were underseasoned and there were no salt or pepper shakers to be found.

The waiter remembered that one of us was vegetarian so it was nice of him to bring out the dish with the bacon on the side, so we could both try it.

2015-05-22,5.0,"Rarely does a restaurant exceed expectations like mEAT did for me tonight. And we actually came in with already high expectations with all of the positive reviews. mEAT lived up to their reviews and then-some. As I mentioned before, I really wanted to try mEAT due to the reviews but also because it's three blocks from where I live, making it quite a convenient restaurant. We walk and were immediately seated at a nice table by the kitchen. I noticed they had some outdoor seating (in the form of swings) which I will surely take advantage of on a return visit when the weather is a tad more agreeable. First and foremost, the ambiance was pleasant, the restaurant was clean and stylish, and our waiter oozed charisma. He was extremely friendly, funny, and made great recommendations for drinks, appetizers, entrees and sides. He took care great of our table making sure we never went too long without a refill. Personally I always really enjoy when a waiter is able to read a table and able to respond accordingly. Our waiter, Mak, definitely deserves special consideration for going above and beyond the call of duty.  Now to the really good part - the food. We started with a magic margarita and la Paloma - two speciality drinks. We moved to our appetizer - the crab Rangoon flatbread. Words cannot possibly express how good this was. I was blown away. The sauce was the same filling for the crab Rangoon, and it was sprinkled with crab pieces on top of the cheese. It was made fresh and absolutely delicious. It was well worth waiting an extra few minutes for the food to arrive fresh. Our entrees and side were next. The side was Brussel sprouts with bacon and seasoning. Now I'm not usually a big fan of Brussel sprouts but these were an exception. Flavored very well and of course- bacon makes everything taste better. Next up was the Cajun andouille sausage. It was hung from a skewer at our table. Very good! And my favorite dish was the pistachio crusted lamb - also hung from a skewer. This was absolutely amazing. The crust gave it a crunch and a flavor I've never had with lamb before. I'm honestly happy the dishes ran out because I would have eaten myself into absolute oblivion.  All in all this was an excellent experience and I will be making a return trip in the future. Some people might think it's a little pricey but hey - you definitely are getting what you pay for!",0.9991,0.726,0.261,0.013,0.562069073484168

We tried to make a positive out of a negative but ended up going to eat at another restaurant (taverna 750) last night after we paid for over priced and VERY UNDERWHELMING food and experience at mEAT. Are people who are leaving high reviews drunk when they eat here? Or did the gimmick of the swings sell you ? $73 including tip for this garbage. And I tipped 20 % for terrible service as well.  Beef tenderloin was clearly sitting refrigerated all day and had a stale taste.  Veggie skewer? Huge chunks of flavorless nothing. The corn was the only decent piece of this.  Your only saving graces were the balsamic reduction on the re heated Brussels sprouts and thank god for the cucumber gimlet or there would have been nothing good about this experience.   The server waltzed past us and barely even checked on our table. When, in brief passing , literally without even stopping at our table - he asked as he walked by how everything was tasting and clearly didn't hear that we were dis satisfied. Otherwise maybe your establishment could have remedied the situation. Clearly he didn't actually care how everything was tasting.

I ordered a drink, forget which one, and it was VERY good.  I had a concern about some of the ingredients being gluten-free, but the waiter was very knowledgeable about the gluten content and put my mind at ease.  The drink was the highlight of the meal, by far. My sister ordered the stuffed mushrooms as an app and really enjoyed them (they included breadcrumbs, so I didn't have any).  I think she came away with a slightly better impression of the dinner than I did, mainly because of the tasty app.   We got a chicken skewer and a veggie skewer.  As far as I could taste, absolutely nothing had been done in the way of flavoring or spicing or marinating either one.  The chicken was on the dry side and didn't taste like much.  The veggies didn't appear to have anything on them at all.  Without the benefit of olive oil or butter and a dash of salt, there just wasn't anything to like about them.  The reality is that every time I've ever grilled veggies or done kabobs, the product has been tastier and appears to have been given more consideration than our dinner was given at mEAT. Considering what we were served, the prices are way too high.  The atmosphere is nice, the wait staff is attentive and informed, but the food is lack-luster at best.  So go for a few drinks if you're in the neighborhood, but head elsewhere for your meal.",0.9905,0.833,0.139,0.028,0.5878260869565216

The worst part of it all was the price.  At 24.00 for the scallops (2 medium and 2 small sized ones) and 24.00 for the lamb (2 small pieces) that is just outrageous if not borderline criminal.   The server was nice but after we placed our first order we waited about 25-30 minutes until we got the first dish.  Ridiculous.  All he other dishes were brought to the table at odd times.

I told him I was gonna Yelp the place and next thing I know I had a free avocado chocolate pudding dessert. I would say the only negative is the bathroom situation.

So disappointing, especially for the price! - After waiting for at least 40mins, we finally received the 3 skewers we ordered: the tenderloin, the salmon and bacon wrapped dates.  We also ordered the quinoa casserole. - The tenderloin was decent.  The salmon was really salty.  The quinoa casserole was delicious.  Probably the BEST thing they have there. - The BACON WRAPPED DATES WERE SERVED TO US WITH RAW BACON!  They were so raw, that the dates just slid off the skewer by themselves, one by one, falling on the plate below them.  My friend was staring in amazement at how raw they were.  When I pointed this out to our server, even he said ""...wow...I wouldn't eat that either...that's definitely raw...""  He said he would go talk to the chefs in back.  When he came back, he said that the chefs basically shrugged their shoulders and said that ""....he [the server] rushed them and that is why the bacon was raw...]   THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE and the Chef should be fired for sending out food that he knew was raw.  I just couldn't believe the lack of attention and pride this chef has in his cooking!  And the ""just whatever"" attitude of the chef and our server was completely outrageous and unbelievable!  The server offered to make us another serving of the dates, but, after waiting so long, I didn't want to ruin the evening any further.  Plus, why would I trust that chef, again?! - Over $130 for THAT???  Absolutely NOT.  Do not waste your time with this farce of a restaurant! What a shame about this place.  I was so excited, too.  Please just bring back the old mini bar and the old menu.  Such a poor execution of such a cool concept.",0.9853,0.776,0.139,0.086,0.4733846153846153

2015-01-22,3.0,"First the good news: The staff is really friendly and accomodating. The space is very cool (I love the giant wooden door in the back) and the drinks are well made. However, in the end it's just bland meat on a skewer and overpriced. We had the lemon chicken (barely seasoned chicken that you dip into lemon sauce) and the rosemary pork (barely seasoned pork that you dip into raisin chutney). The meat is anywhere from $15-$28 per skewer depending on what you order. We had a flatbread (very good) the aforementioned meat (okay), and the mushrooms (also very good and a big portion). The chocolate fondue was not good. It was the consistency of chocolate milk, rather than thicker that sticks to the pretzels, marshmallows etc.  Our bill for 4 drinks, 1 app, 2 meats, 1 side dish, and 1 dessert was $108 + tip. If the cost of the meat was lowered a bit I'd raise my stars. Instead I think I'll just go for an app or drink and then have dinner elsewhere.",0.9631,0.873,0.119,0.008,0.5195614035087719

2014-11-23,2.0,"Really wanted to like this place but the night was not at all like the reviews below. It sounds like everyone who has posted a review came on a slow Friday/Saturday night so the service was great. Unfortunately yesterday was an extremely busy Saturday night and our experience was less than good because of it, I don't think this restaurant has matured enough to understand how to handle a busy night. We got there 30 minutes before our reservation and although there were 4+ booths open the hostess said she could not seat us because the booths are for parties of 3-4 people so we would have to wait until the next 2 person seating opened up (funny because there were 2 booths that were taken and each of them had only 2 people but she wouldn't allow us to) but she mentioned to grab a drink at the bar while waiting. Waiting by the bar was awful the waiters/waitresses were picking up food and dropping off orders and we were awkwardly standing there since the rest of the bar area was full. The waitresses were rushed and running into us left and right asking us to move. Very awkward and small packed seating/standing area by the bar. We were at the bar for over 15 minutes and none of those 4+ booths ever became occupied so that annoyed us a bit, why couldn't we have just sat there?  Once we got to our table the restaurant slowly started to fill up and our waiter was struggling. Took about 15 minutes to even get our order of drinks in, another 10 minutes to get his attention to order food. We got the hot bacon flatbread which wasn't great (overly powering jalapeño, no other flavors stood out) and we waited another 10 minutes for our water to be refilled. We got one of our skewers and the other one came out 10 minutes later. Not very organized, had to flag our waiter down each time we needed something. The bacon wrapped chicken skewer was slightly cold (and slightly dry) so I bet it was sitting at the window waiting to get picked up. The beef tenderloin tip skewers were great. Service really can make or break a review..",0.9022,0.855,0.081,0.064,0.5512138188608778

Our meat skewers came out way before our sides and we were ready to leave by the time our sides came out. The cocktails are delicious, so I'd go back for drinks but that's about it.

And the number of items on each skewer is different and odd, so some people got a whole meatball, for example, while others had to share one. And the ""molecular"" cocktails are all hype.

I guess I just struggle with the concept. The meat skewers are displayed on the table from a hanging frame thing but I'm not sure how effective it is because at our 2 person table everything was still cramped. Plus, it took a while for the skewers. We had the Caesar salad to start which was ok. The bacon onion tart was good. The kale chips that are at each table weren't very good, we ate them because they were there but they tasted bad- there are better kale chips out there. The beef tenderloin skewer was dry and the cauliflower puree had no seasoning. The drinks (and to an extent the food) are steep, they claim it's because they are micro drinks and all the ingredients are made in house. I guess. But for $12 a cocktail, I'd rather go down the block to Wood. The drinks were fine but pricey. All in all, I didn't eat anything bad, but I didn't eat anything great either.

We arrived at around 5:30 hoping to get a good indoor seat with an outside view and we got in with no issues. The patio benches outside were completely taken tho which makes sense given the amazing weather this evening. We were greeted promptly once we walked in and right after we were seated. Our waiter was amazing - bubbly, knowledgeable and excited to be there. It was our first time and he walked through all the ins and outs of the menu and offered up great recommendations that did not disappoint (side note, he smelled really really good too). We started off with the crab Rangoon flat bread, amazing. Tastes like a lighter version of grab Rangoon so you can eat a few bites without feeling like a complete cow. Hubby ordered the manhattan and said it was one of the best drinks he's had in the area. So much so he had two of them, while I ate the cherries that came with it (they were delicious and I am 9 months pregnant). For our entree, we split the fondue Mac and cheese, chicken skewer wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cream cheese and jalapeño, and beef tip skewer that came with a horseradish dipping sauce. Everything was made to perfection. The flavor in the beef was so good that you didn't even need the sauce, and I am a sucker for sauce. Didn't make it to dessert because we were stuffed at that point, but will definitely be back to try out the dessert fondue they offer. All in all, one of the best places in boystown.

The Magic Margarita ($11) was recommended by our server, it was strong and good. It is served over a large cube  of pomegranate ice which is cool!  We started with the stuffed mushrooms at $8, they were packed with breadcrumbs and flavor, thanks to salt. I would recommend them.  We got a side of the fondue Mac and Cheese at $9 and we were a bit disappointed. Though it contains apple-wood smoked bacon, green peas, garlic, bay leaves, white pepper, sharp Vermont cheddar & Gouda, white wine and sun-dried tomatoes the flavor just didn't wow me. We tried two skewers, both were good but not great and a bit pricey for what you got.  - Bacon wrapped Chicken at $13 was a bit of a disappointment, the cream cheese was barely distinguishable by the pallet and understandable the bacon was half uncooked as it was cooked next to the other bite.   -Pistachio crusted pork at $14 looked cool but had not real distinguishable flavor other than the oyster plum sauce it was served with.

I appreciated the promptness and professionalism of his reply, and I really did want to like mEAT the first time around so I agreed.  I made reservations and my friend showed up before me and they seated her promptly and brought out waters and some kale chips for her to enjoy. When I arrived the waiter introduced himself, Cody, and went over the mEAT experience with my friend as it was her first time. I really enjoyed the kale chips (having never had them before). My friend said she made them all the time but these were much better. We ordered drinks, which, again, were phenomenal. The bartender is top-notch.  Ordering our meals, the waiter made some suggestions of his favorite items some of which we took him up on. We ordered the bacon-wrapped chicken (again, I just can't quit bacon), the beef tenderloin tips, puréed cauliflower, and the steakhouse mushrooms.  The food the second time around was outstanding. The beef tenderloin tips were juicy and perfectly cooked (the horseradish yogurt sauce giving it a perfect kick). The puréed caulifower was great. But, by far my favorite were the steakhouse mushrooms! The flavor burst in your mouth. Just great! Cody offered us the dessert menu which we declined because we honestly couldn't eat anymore, we were so full, although we had enough to take home with us and asked for it to-go.

We came around the corner, saw the swings, and thought it looked like a great place to try. The swings were cool to eat on, of course the day being perfect out, added to that. We both ordered magic margarita, which was fantastic!! Definitely give it a try, they put a pomegranate ice cube in it, so as it melts, the taste is always changing on you. For food, we ordered the lemon chicken kabob, the bacon wrapped date skewer, and the cauliflower. If you are eating a specific way, gluten free, Paleo-etc, they actually mark it on the menu, which is extremely handy. Everything we are, was phenomenal! We will definitely be back, to try other things, we also met Josh, the owner, and he couldn't have been more pleasant, and took the time, out of his day, to chit chat with us. 5 stars for sure!",0.9848,0.83,0.17,0.0,0.6415032679738563

2014-07-31,4.0,"Really interesting, cool and original concept. Went with my sister and her husband for a double date night on Saturday and the place was packed. We were 10 minutes late getting there and they were super cool when I called to let them know. Even though the place was packed they did not threaten to give our table away or anything and were so nice and welcoming upon our arrival. As others have said the cocktails are part of their specialty. I had an American Mule and it was very well done and delicious. I would not say it was much of a spin on the original but fresher for sure. Good but $12 may be a stretch for that one.  The food was hit and miss, but the misses were not by any means terrible - just not as good as some of the really delicious ones. Some of our favorites were the Bacon Wrapped Dates (my fav and I could have ordered another), the Meatball, Scallops and the Tenderloin. I am not much of a steak eater but the others said it was good. For me the Dates and Meatballs were the best. The Wasabi Crusted Salmon was just kinda eh and a little dry and the Pistachio Pork was good but nothing like the others I mentioned.  We also the truffle cheese fondue to start and that was tasty and not a ridiculous amount so it did not ruin our appetites for the skewers. We also shared the White Chocolate dessert fondue and the best part of that was all the amazing accompaniments they gave you to dip into it. The White Chocolate itself could have been thicker but it was still fun because of everything they offer to dip in it.  All in all a very fun place to go with others and try a little of everything. Cool concept with the skewers and tongs and the way the the food is presented at your table. The owner also stopped by to introduce himself and ask how everything was and was super nice and chatted with us for awhile and seemed to really want our honest thoughts and opinions. I'd say food was perhaps 3.5 stars overall but everything else about this place brings it to a 4.",0.9972,0.732,0.214,0.054,0.5403216374269005

She had the bacon wrapped chicken skewer which was also awesome it was stuffed with jalepeno and cream cheese and seasoned to perfection. Great experience.

2014-06-07,3.0,"I went with a friend for a late dinner on a Thursday night. The place itself was dark and intimate but a little too loud since minibar is right next door. There are swings out in front that you can sit on while you eat, which I thought was fun and if it wasn't too chilly out we probably would've sat there, but we chose a booth instead.  They first brought out a complimentary bucket of kale chips. We were very excited for them but unfortunately they were all burned and left a very bitter taste. I maybe found one or two that looked ok and everything else went to waste. My friend and I then ordered some drinks, I got the la Paloma which are usually made with squirt lemon soda and tequila. They used grapefruit instead which I was excited for and really craving some nice carbonation after those burnt chips..I think they tried to get too fancy with their drinks and it just really turned out disgusting. Instead of a nice carbonated cocktail... I got salt, which is literally what it tasted like. I told the waiter that I just could not bring myself to drink it and he brought me a modern cosmo instead, which was ok but sometimes simple is just better. My friend ordered the schezuan button cocktail which also just ok, wouldn't order that ever again.  If my night ended there, this place wouldn't gotten at most 2 stars because they did have excellent service and a great place, but the food was quite good. For the app we ordered the crab ragoon flatbread which tasted exactly what it sounds like, it was very yummy. Then, we ordered the chicken wrapped in bacon with jalopeno and cream cheese inside, brussel sprouts and quinoa casserole to share for the table. You can't really go wrong with a skewer like that. It was good, but smaller pieces than I expected.. Which ended up being a good thing because the quinoa casserole was veryyy dense and not that great either, wouldn't order it again. The brussels were my favorite. Simple and delicious!  Overall, it wasn't horrible, but am I planning to go there again anytime soon? Definitely not.",0.9986,0.709,0.256,0.036,0.5626736111111111

We sat at the bar at the window and that made for some people watching fun along with our dinner.  The service was very good, didn't bug us but he was available when we needed him.   Seriously, next time I go to mEAT, I'm asking for my food on a plate.  I realize that makes me a party-pooper, but I assure you having me not annoyed and fed is better than hungry, annoyed, and armed with skewers.",0.9937,0.678,0.239,0.083,0.6678395061728395

Right away he blew us away by his description of some of the drinks, which turned out to be spot on! Heather at the bar managed to make drinks that took my love of tequila to new heights (a reposado tequila old fashioned). Derek continued to walk us through the menu, suggesting just the right amount of dishes. Cucumber cups, served cold with salty kalamata olive tampenade and feta cheese filling were good, and were then followed up by skewers of lobster tails, scallops, and beef tenderloin, accompanied by sides of skillet mushrooms and brussel sprouts. The food quality was second to none....large lobster tails for the reasonable price, some of the largest scallops I had EVER seen and beef tenderloin that was cooked to a perfect beef lovers medium rare. The brussel sprouts were tender and moist, flavored with bacon and reduced balsamic, and the skillet mushrooms were impossibly rich, cooked in burgundy and black pepper. And dessert.....not something that I usually do (aside from cordials), was something to behold. A white chocolate fondue that defeats all (sorry Geja's) and great French press coffee. Was this inexpensive - no, but the quality of the food makes the idea of ever returning to a Brazilian steak house for massive portions of just ok meat, crazy.

I've been wanting to try this place for awhile, and I made Valentine's Day reservations back in January.  At the last minute, however, it was looking like my date had to cancel on me, so I called the restaurant to cancel the reservation -- only to have my date decide he wanted to get together after all about 30 minutes later.  Oops.  I called Meat back right away to see if they could squeeze us back in, and John was super nice about it and told us we could have our table back. That was the start of excellent service that lasted the entire evening.  Everyone who came to our table was warm, friendly, and seemed genuinely concerned about whether we were enjoying ourselves.  And enjoy ourselves we did -- from the complimentary kale chips brought to our table before the meal, to the four drinks we ordered (all amazing, although I found myself rather partial to the Maple Foam Manhattan), to the stuffed mushrooms was good.  As for the skewers themselves -- we ordered the bacon wrapped dates to start and agreed that was our favorite, but the bacon wrapped chicken and beef tenderloin were awesome as well.  We also shared the Bananas Foster fondue for desert, and even though I'm usually not a big fan of white chocolate, I enjoyed it a lot (although the aforementioned drinks may have helped with that!) The ambiance is great, the service is great, the food is great.  It's not the cheapest -- our bill, sans tip, came to about $130 -- but it's well worth the price for a nice night out.",0.9951,0.766,0.212,0.022,0.5233543417366946
2014-01-30,4.0,"Pleasantly busy but not crowded on a weekday night. We sat at the bar and the bartender was  great. I only had one cocktail and my friend had beers so I feel like I can't quite judge their cocktail list, but they may be a bit on the expensive side for what you're getting. This isn't a craft cocktail bar. This place is an endless source of puns and double entendre. Your meat skewers are suspended from a hook and you grab them with tongs. The beef tenderloin tips were perfectly cooked if you're a real meat lover- medium rare. So if you like your meat burned, you'll have to specify. Well-done shaming. They have one sad little veggie skewer on the menu that probably never gets ordered. For sure get the mac and cheese side- it's much bigger than I expected and probably shareable for up to three people even if it's your only side. Caught a glimpse of the chocolate fondue dessert which comes with a wide variety of dippable items. Looked amazing and huge!",0.9883,0.749,0.204,0.047,0.6771604938271606
2014-01-24,5.0,This place is top notch. It has a unique menu offering both in food and drink.  I would recommend this place to anyone in the area. The bacon wrapped chicken is delicious (far more deluxe then it sounds). The Mac and cheese (seriously) was a great addition and would be to any of the meats. All in all Meat is a must have experience. You won't be disappointed.,0.9281,0.801,0.199,0.0,0.8016666666666667
2014-01-21,5.0,"I shared my second date here with a great gentleman. The service was great. The atmosphere was romantic but not too much so that I wouldn't go with friends or family. The skewer selection and concept was unique, something I have never experienced before and not only delicious but also a fun conversation piece. There paleo friendly menu was something that I dont see in very many restaurants. Great dessert as well. Ill definitely be going back!",0.9578,0.59,0.299,0.11,0.6062500000000001

2014-01-17,5.0,"All I can say is wow! We were blown away by the service, ambiance and the food.  We were immediately greeted by the owner who gave us the run down of the concept as well as his suggestions on food and cocktails.  I started with the Szechuan Button Cocktail which is the most magical drink I've ever had! I don't want to spoil it for you, but the exotic flower in the drink plays amazing tricks on your mouth! We followed by eating the Wisconsin Trio Fondue followed by the lemon chicken skewers, beef tenderloin tips, meatballs and seared scallops. All of the meat was MELT In YOUR MOUTH good! The meatball was my personal favorite of the bunch.  Our server, Steven, was outstanding and very knowledgeable of the food and cocktail menu.  I will definitely be back for more ""mEAT""!",0.9836,0.779,0.195,0.026,0.6581349206349206
2014-01-17,3.0,"Definitely NOT a five star- not exactly sure how they are getting this average..   I rate a two. Not terrible though.  Possibly worth a second try. Drink was very expensive and small.  Beef was way overcooked- even for well done (I had asked for medium rare- wasn't in the mood for sending things back).  The fondue at a neighboring table looked great however- would likely go well with some skewers. Menu NOT well suited for solo diners- I found I wound up with too little of some and way too much of other things. The menu could do a better job presenting the venue's theme.  It was detailed enough however and visually appealing - something often lacking. The staff was excellent, and very, very friendly.  Not at all superficial-  nice, good people- enough so for me  to bump rating up to a three.  And, yes, I probably will give it another try - perhaps with a dining partner.",0.9792,0.771,0.199,0.03,0.5966908212560387
2014-01-14,5.0,"Tried our mEAT for the first time last Friday and can confirm what others here have said...it was an excellent experience! For a party of three we had a variety of cocktails (the 'American Mule' is amazing), apps (well, app, the fondue - so much cheese), and skewers.  I'm a sucker for anything wrapped in bacon and the bacon wrapped chicken skewer with jalapeño creme cheese was so so tasty! Service was phenomenal.  Friendly, conversational, attentive and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  They also highlight which options are both gluten free and paleo friendly which is a nice touch.   Definitely a smidge on the pricey side (prob. $50ish for each of us) but well worth it when you combine the great food/drink with the ambience.  It's not a huge locations so I would recommend a quick call for reservations just to be safe.

2014-01-13,5.0,"What a great concept. The cocktail menu can rival any top mixologist in the city, and the cost per drink is a few dollars less than most places, and the food is top quality and very fare prices. The concept is very cool. Tapas style, steakhouse quality food, all served on hanging skewers at your table. The wild king salmon with miso/apricot dipping sauce has great flavor, the scallops are jumbo and succulent, and the lamb chops have tons of flavor. Each skewer comes with a homemade dipping sauce, and are very fun to share.  The meal starts with free kale chips(most places charge for that), and the side dishes are steakhouse quality. Roasted Brussel sprouts with pancetta, and cauliflower puree are delightful. I had a Manhattan with maple foam and it was so darn tasty. Prices are very fair, atmosphere is great. Can't wait to go back!",0.9867,0.793,0.207,0.0,0.5326041666666667
2014-01-13,5.0,"Came here with a group of about 8 friends.  Everything was a great experience!  The service was fantastic - waiter was super helpful with drink and food suggestions, and was very friendly.  The drinks were fantastic.  Good beer choices, interesting mixed drinks and margaritas.  The fondue was delicious, as were all of the skewers that I tried.  We were a big group so we were able to order a ton of stuff and try a little bit of everything on the table.  The sides were phenomenal.  The mushrooms were amazing as was the cauliflower puree.  Very sad we were too full for dessert.  Highly recommended for a night out with a group!",0.9891,0.67,0.304,0.026,0.6430392156862745
2014-01-12,5.0,"A truly unique experience, and great idea.  There is a variety of skewers to choose from.  I recommend the Jumbo Shrimp, and Tenderloin Tips as well as the side of Brussel Sprouts. The shrimp were really jumbo!  It has a great vibe, and unique mixology cocktails. I had the Button Cocktail that was the delicious!

2014-01-09,5.0,"Great experience here. Had been to the old restaurant that Mini-bar had in this spot & loved it so had to check this one out. The inside has been slightly redone, it's got a more distinct atmosphere of its own now, separate from the bar next door. Everything we had was great. The meats we chose were a little spicier than the waiter let on, but that's all subject to opinion I suppose. Despite this he was very friendly, without overloading us with information & had no problem offering up suggestions when we asked. Looking forward to going back & trying more things from the menu!",0.7377,0.832,0.111,0.056,0.46071428571428574
2014-01-08,5.0,"Took the whole family here for a new experience.  We had such a blast!!!  Great staff, excellent service and great food.  I love the name mEAT how ingenious.  They had something for everyone, even my picky 12 year old grandson.  In my past experiences Brazilian meats have always been dry and flavorless, so I was hesitant to eat here when the family wanted to try it.  Boy was I surprised the meats were moist the sauces were flavorful, the kids even ate their veggies!! I loved the decor and the environment, very upscale and trendy.  You will be seeing us back at mEATs for sure.",0.9753,0.767,0.214,0.019,0.6054961378490792
2014-01-07,5.0,"This place has a wonderful vibe and what a classy yet casual approach at a new concept in dining. The interior has taken on a new image from its previous life, contemporary and inviting. On a recent dining experience with friends we had a nice variety of different skewers, fish, pork, chicken. The Kale salad was pretty incredible! The meat tender, seasoned just right with many flavors to dance on your tongue. Fondue can be very tricky and I have been to a couple places where I was not impressed! Since my last trip here I cannot stop thinking about how delicious these fondues where! I was very impressed with the presentation of the items as well.  The menu offers a nice mix of many offerings to satisfy any palate. This is a fun place to go with a group, or on a date. The atmosphere allows for a very pleasurable experience. I highly recommend dining out at meat!",0.9884,0.708,0.252,0.04,0.5889434022767356
2014-01-03,5.0,"We were visiting Chicago for a few days, and wandered past mEAT.  They weren't open yet (it was mid-afternoon), but a super-friendly doorman visited with us.  The concept sounded great, so we returned on New Year's Eve. What a great restaurant!  Among other appetizers, they offer a small selection of cheese fondues, sort of a ""greatest hits"" sampling of that restaurant that rhymes with Pelting Mot.  There's a similar ""greatest hits"" sampling of chocolate fondues for dessert.  You want to save room for dessert! And oohhhh, the meat.  The beef tenderloin tips were tasty (if you want them cooked more than medium, be sure to tell your waiter!), but the real star was the bacon-wrapped chicken breast, stuffed with cream cheese and jalapeno.  Sooo good! The waitstaff were very friendly, helpful, and attentive.  The restaurant has a modern feel to it, but is cozy, and the background music wasn't overpowering. mEAT was a highlight of our trip to Chicago.  You locals, be good to mEAT, so I can eat there again some day.  mEAT managers, when does your Austin TX location open?  :-)",0.9963,0.72,0.275,0.006,0.6051493192797541
