2017-08-19,4.0,"Hot chicken outside of Nashville isn't quite the same, but Budlong comes close!  I came here with a group of friends for Sunday brunch and arrived just as they opened.  Within half an hour, we looked up from our food and noticed a line to the door.  The restaurant is on the smaller side, does not take reservations, but was still suitable for our group of 6 or so with the availability of picnic-style tables. The chicken can be ordered at varying spice levels (Classic, Hot, Xtra Hot).  The menu keeps it simple with chicken tenders, sandwiches, and plates, with a variety of sides.  Specials are listed on a chalkboard in the restaurant.  I had the chicken and waffles (hot).  The spice level was comfortable but still remarkably spicy.  I also ordered the mac and cheese and a biscuit.  While these were EXCELLENT, I was overstuffed without a doubt when we left.  Southern food is hearty, and the portions are good.  Don't skip the sides though, just bring a friend who has the same tastes as you do and share! This is NOT BYOB, but there are several beers available.",0.9859,0.846,0.154,0.0,0.5412698412698412

This might possibly be my new favorite fried chicken spot. The dark meat is so juicy and the skin is crispy with all this dry rub seasoning covering it.  The collard greens are the best I've had (not that I've had a ton). It had so much flavor and wasn't overcooked.  The mac n cheese was decent...nothing really unique.  The biscuit was definitely my favorite side.  I think it's fine without the jam.  It's somehow flakey, dense, buttery all at the same time.

2017-08-06,5.0,"What's the best way to start the day before heading out to an all day & night city street fest (or any other day actually)? The Budlong's fried chicken! Yes, hear me out on this. We got to The Budlong a little before noon on a Saturday and the place had a few tables occupied.  I like the restaurant's casual and open lay out, the white furnitures (I love white) and the use of red bandanas as table napkins. The counter staff were very helpful when they figured out that it was our first time here and we decided on getting the following: BUDLONG TENDERS $9- Outstanding and huge classic solid pieces served on top of a rich, white bread with dipping sauce and pickle slices. The chicken was cooked perfectly...crispy outside and the juicy, tender and delicious meat inside.  TENDERS & CHEESE GRITS (from the Brunch Menu Board) $9.50 - Excellent! I ordered the hot chicken...the hot sauce flavor was amazing and the level of spiciness was perfect. This blended so well with the cheesy and yummy grits. I would get this dish over and over. MAC N CHEESE & COLLARD GREENS $4 each - both sides were very tasty and satisfying. MIMOSA & BLOODY MARY $8 each - both drinks were magnificent and strong enough to give us a good kick start of the day. Overall, I am somehow thankful that this is not near where I live..otherwise, I'm going to have major issues not being able to resist coming here everyday. Customers kept coming in until the place was full by the time we were leaving. The service was efficient and welcoming, the place is clean and well organized...most importantly, even though their menu is limited...their food made me very happy.

The three star review is for service and dry chicken in my last visit. Let me elaborate my disappointment in service: 1. During our first visit for carryout, they forgot to give me the side that I had paid for and it was so cold outside that I did not bother to go back. I called them and did make a note to give me the side the next time. 2. Second visit we were dining in with our 3month old baby, everyone who came after us were getting their food.  We waited almost for 30mins and when I checked with our waitress (as she was busy on her cell), she said ""Oh I forgot to put your order in"" WTF . The food was good but we had lost interest by that time . 3. Last week, for carryout: I could see my order sitting on the window for 5mins but the waiter was on his cell (the restaurant was not crowded ) When I asked him for my order, he is like ""give me 5mins to bag it in""...really???

I'm not a big fried food person, so the fact that they didn't even offer a grilled option was a little bit of a turn off. Nevertheless, I agreed. I ordered the chicken salad with the classic level of heat. After one bite I was sold, and I regretted questioning their methodology. They do fried chicken, and they do fried chicken well. Tender, moist chicken enrobed in a crispy, perfectly seasoned breading. And they have somehow managed to achieve this level of crunch with just a thin layer of batter. Helped me feel less guilty! A note on the salad itself- mixed greens with spinach, cherry tomatoes, asparagus and other yummy goodies. As it's known for fried chicken, I assumed nutrient content was not at the top of the list of priorities for the Budlong so I half expected the lettuce to be iceberg. Not the case.

The Budlong has now moved to a new location on Armitage off Halsted, they were previously on Broadway near Diversey.  Although the one on Broadway was tight, small and had  uncomfortable bar stools it had a better food deal and was more accessible to foot and street traffic.  This one is bigger, but it's out of the way and competes with a higher caliber of restaurants and bars in the area.  The only thing that hasn't changed is the uncomfortable seating, they even have indoor picnic tables!  If (and that's a BIG if) I was to go there again I'd bring a cushion. They've changed the menu too, before you could get 2 sides with your meal and now everything is al a carte.  Also did away with a side I really enjoyed at the original location, a corn dish called elotes.  It was popular too, can't understand why they'd get rid of it??  This time I ordered their unremarkable red potato salad which was on the bland side and tried to order one of their biscuits but for some odd reason they weren't ready, poor planning if you ask me! I ordered their fried chicken sandwich on an unremarkable brioche bun and when I bit into the chicken I thought my mouth was on fire!  I wanted to scream, where's the fire extinguisher?  Even my friend who ordered the 2-piece chicken had the same experience, we kept on saying how hot it was and honestly it ruined the whole meal for us.  We even had to ask for more water it was so hot.   FYI, on the menu it was rated 1 star for heat level, however it should've been at least 3!  Even one of the managers came over and asked my friend (not me?) how it was and she told him it was TOO HOT. So what did he do about it...absolutely NOTHING.  Duh!  So then why did you ask?  It's that kind of place. Summary: TOO HOT, uncomfortable seating and unresponsive management.

2016-12-12,3.0,"So my first time in the new Armitage Ave shop was Friday around 7:30 pm. I had been to the revival location and was a huge fan. Pluses: The new location has a great layout, lots of seating and a good location for groups. The menu is awesome, lots of great options bone-in or boneless. The chicken is amazing, spicy, and flavorful. I tried the biscuit for a side. Wow, that pepper yet sweet butter will rock your world. BYOB for the time being which is nice. I got the hot and I thought it wasn't too spicy but had a great kick.  Cons: The counter service moved a little slow but again they just opened so no big deal. The layout is a bit confusing, you order at the register but then if you want water or silverware or anything you have to flag down a server to bring it to you. It was a bit hectic and I wish I had known this when I was paying since I didn't leave a tip. The major con was my food arrived 20 minutes after the rest of my party. I had ordered 1/4 dark meat, and the rest got sandwiches. I understand different food takes different time to prepare but that large of a gap is a bummer especially when  you are forced to sit and watch everyone enjoy their meal. The ( I assumed) manager did not seem to be particularly concerned with this and seemed annoyed when I asked when my food would arrive.

2016-12-09,4.0,"After trying them at Revival and being a fan of Rub, their chicken rose to the top for me, so I was ecstatic to find out they were opening up very close to me, especially as I wasn't able to make it to their previous location. Of course I went on opening day...after a workout. I loved the space and they made great use of it. I liked the side of booths and the other of individual countertop seating, with large picnic-styled tables in the middle. Overall, it was very inviting and we were warmly greeted. I got the quarter white (hot) with collard greens and potato salad. Boo got quarter white (classic) with mac n cheese and biscuit. After reading reviews of the previous location, I was a little disappointed to see that sides were all a la carte.  Utensils and wet naps were already at the tables, so that was nice. Our waters came out to us quickly and then our sides came at an appropriate time. However, we waited quite awhile for our chicken. We were notified that they accidentally dropped in a dark instead of white meat, so we opted to have that instead and then wait for the other. After this snafu, they probably wanted to get out our orders out asap, so when I got mine, it looked great on the outside. Unfortunately, it was raw in the middle. While still inspecting with my boo, the chef notices me right away and brings it back. Another Budlong member (manager/owner?) comes by very apologetically and comps our entire meal. They had a dark meat going and the white would take much longer so I just opted for the dark.  Now, to the actual food. I love their chicken because their skin is extra crispy while the meat is super juicy. I am a spicy addict and they definitely satisfy that need. I got the extra hot at Revival and thought I'd get the hot here to compare. While I would be happy with any of them, I will be getting the extra hot every time going forward. Note though, each level is probably a little hotter than your standard place... #NashvilleHot  I usually don't care for the accompanied bread but since the chicken was sitting atop the hefty toast, it got some nice tasty flavor from it. All of the sides were better than average, but that biscuit was hands down, the best biscuit I've ever had. Like whoa. Pricing seems a little steep but I suppose not unusual for the neighborhood. Portions were pretty good though. While our experience was less than ideal, it was opening day and they remedied the situation and all parties were genuinely sorry. Friendly attentive staff, but hopefully mishaps like mine will be a thing of the past. Their chicken and biscuits though are definite superstars. Looking forward to trying their soft serve (hope the pineapple flavor that I saw on Insta is here to stay) and pies and whatever this place has in store! *Came back for a late lunch and got the extra hot sandwich...this was super yummy and love all the ingredients that went into this. Be careful, that chicken is so juicy that it actually squirted. It would be nice if they had two registers (or separate area for large/to-go orders), as it wasn't busy when we went but two ladies ahead of us took a lifetime to order.

It was the driest piece of meat I ever put in my mouth (ha!) lol its cold, hard, note: NOT crispy, but HARD! i think I even bite into a tiny piece of bone in there. the meat was dry, thin, hard to chew or swallow, the flavor is there but that sandwich was just not enough to be sold at a store for $10, like I can get a better sandwich for half the price anywhere that sells chicken sandwich for 5 or less.

My boyfriend and I ordered delivery.  We both ordered the light (all white meat) classic heat level chicken plates.  Our dinner was delivered in under 30 minutes, which was so great!  The chicken was hot, spicy and moist.  Soooo delicious.  They nailed it. I took one star off for the sides offered here.  The options are lacking and the portion size is very small. I enjoyed the elote and my boyfriend liked the potato salad, but neither of us liked the collard greens.  The only other option is black eyed peas, which really aren't for everyone. They don't offer fries (or even mashed potatoes or chips) or macaroni and cheese here...what kind of southern food establishment is this?  If they expanded/improved their side selection this place would definitely be 5 stars.  And they should probably do all that they can to be appealing to the masses if they want to stay in business while RIGHT next to Crisp (a risky location choice for any new chicken establishment).",0.9887,0.848,0.143,0.009,0.67291218305504

The service was fast and friendly, and the place was pretty dead since I got there just after opening.  I highly recommend this place, and not just as a plan B for when Crisp is packed.  The product is definitely different enough that the two should easily coexist.  For skin I would say The Budlong is better, for flavor I give the BBQ variety at Crisp the edge.  For price Budlong wins easily since you get two sides for what Crisp charges for the chicken alone.  If you're entertaining people from out of town, get both and let them decide!",0.9945,0.773,0.173,0.055,0.5405391351943076

I enjoyed the flavor of the collards, although I did find them to be too salty. The potato salad was a good choice to help subdue some of the heat from the chicken.  If there is one thing I'd change about the sandwich: I found the bread and butter pickles to be overwhelming. After a few bites, I ate them first and then finished my sandwich. I wanted to taste the hot chicken, not sweet pickles.  Highly recommend Budlong. Go hungry for sure and enjoy one of the best hot chicken restaurants in Chicago.",0.9873,0.776,0.199,0.025,0.6866468253968253

2016-08-27,4.0,"Awesome fried chicken. The outside is crispy (not greasy) and inside is perfectly juicy. They aren't kidding when they say hot chicken. I am a big fan of spicy food and usually have a high tolerance, but even the classic was on the higher end of my spiciness tolerance and had me reaching for my drink. For my sides, I got the collard greens and the elote. The collard greens were ridiculously salty, but the buttery, cheesy, spicy corn was delicious.  The highlight of my meal was definitely the biscuit. Great texture and delicious buttery taste. They also put some sort of garlic/herb(?) butter on top, and it really ties the whole thing together. I wish they would let you substitute a side for the biscuit. $3 seems to be steep for the biscuit, but it is a big portion and enough to share with someone else. Also got a cup of hibiscus aqua fresca that was very refreshing for the humid day and balanced out the spiciness of the rest of my meal.",0.9906,0.755,0.223,0.021,0.6220289855072463

2016-08-17,5.0,"Compliments to Chef Jared Leonard. I took a Rub's BBQ class a few years back and he spoke about his plans to navigate the Nashville hot chicken scene and bring it here to Chicago. Chef won me over not only with his perfectly seasoned, smoked and cooked Brisket, Pulled Pork and Pickles, but his love and passion for sharing BBQ.  He's not just here to share with you a meal to turn pages in the accountant sheets, he's even willing to give you all of his BBQ recipes. He seems to have a genuine passion for food that speaks to your soul. The type of food that you eat with your hands, amongst friends, family, laughter and smiles. He seems to know exactly how to take you there. With that being said, he knocked this out the Mother f'in park.   I had the Classic seasoned White Chicken with a side of Greens and Elote. Something told me that skipping the biscuit would be a mistake so I added one of those for an additional $3, which my friend thought was a bit steep.... He was wrong. I would have paid $5 for another one. Buttery, flaky, rich, decadent, I dunno how many other ways to describe this biscuit, but it was incredibly divine. The Greens were my low-light, but I really only got them to add something green to my plate. Not that they were bad, just pretty average in contrast to how extraordinary everything else was! Growing up in McKinley Park I've had my fair share of Elote and their version, though a bit smaller than I'd expect, had a nice mild char and an abundance of flavor. But that Chicken. I'm still salivating over it. It was adorned with a few bread and butter pickles which accompanied the perfectly balanced, savory, salty, slightly sweet, spicy, crunchy breading. In his trips to discover the secret of Nashville Hot Chicken, Chef Leonard definitely stumbled upon something magical. Perfectly crisp, spicy, and sticky on the outside and hot, juicy and perfectly seasoned throughout the moist succulent interior of the monstrous Chicken breast. I can't say enough. They even had the most delightful slice of white bread to compliment the delicious spice dripping from my fingertips of which I made sure to savor every last bit. Hats off, Chef Leonard speaks to your soul through his food, go see what he's got to say. You will not be disappointed.",0.9988,0.732,0.243,0.025,0.6123638344226581

We both ordered small classic white plates with collard greens, black eyed peas, elote and potato salad. I've had nashville hot chicken before, so I was aware of how spicy it can be. The classic was definitely spicy and it made me actually eat slower! The chicken skin is extra crunchy with a bit of sweetness to it and the meat itself is nice and juicy. I liked the collard greens the most. The elote was okay. The corn seemed like it was boiled and I would have liked it more if it was grilled/roasted.

2016-06-18,5.0,Stumbled upon this place and glad I did.  Got the small white classic and it was plenty of food and perfectly spiced.  Had a biscuit and two other sides (greens and potatoe salad). Honestly greens were as good as Ive had anywhere in south.  Had a peach agua fresca to drink that was outstanding.  Workers were friendly and I will definitely be back!,0.9729,0.691,0.309,0.0,0.5287878787878788
2016-06-17,5.0,"How do I even begin to tell you about the fried chicken heaven that is The Budlong.  To start, it is the BEST fried chicken I have ever had in my life (and that's saying a lot because I LOVE fried chicken).  The skin was perfection, as you cut into it, it made this wonderful crackling sound (I saved a piece of the skin so it would be my last bite of my meal).  I am not a spice fan so I ordered it naked (had the small dark which was a leg and thigh).  The man at the counter said the spicy was REALLY spicy so be forewarned.  You have your choice of sides.  I chose the potato salad (yum, they leave the skin on the pieces of potato) and the biscuit.  Oh, the biscuit.  I was remembering the taste of that biscuit all night long.  Fluffy, melt in your mouth, and I don't know what it was at the center of the biscuit (butter? honey? lard???) but whatever it was, it was tremendous.  (They made a mistake on my order when they gave it to me and it had collard greens and not a biscuit so they ran and got me a biscuit and said ""collard greens on the house."").  The collard greens had a nice apple-cider vinegar flavor to them.  The meals come with home-made pickles (great) and the chicken is on two pieces of white bread so, when you cut into it, the juices from the chicken saturate the bread.  You'd be a fool to not eat some of that bread!!!  What to drink?  Well, they have a selection of soda pop you're not going to find anywhere around here.  Cheerwine!!!!!  Bubble Up!!!!!!  I was all set for a Bubble Up when I noticed the big glass jars of liquid on the counter.  One was water with lemon in it which seemed to be gratis and the other was Watermelon Aqua Fresca.  Well, it was calling my name and, for $2, a bargain.  They gave me a cup with ice, I pressed the tap, and had the most refreshing watermelon drink of my life.  And, I could see how that would come in handy if you had the spicy chicken.  This place is no-frills, long and rectangular with a counter on each side of the wall (they do have outdoor seating).  The meal comes on a paper plate with paper napkins but silverware.  The people who work there could not be more friendly.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  They've only been open for 4 weeks but you would never know that.  Be aware, the chicken doesn't come out right away because they are making it fresh.  And it is worth the wait.  I hesitate sharing about this place because I don't want it to become trendy, hip, or impossible to get my chicken.  But I'm telling you this because I so want them to succeed.  So, go, enjoy!",0.9967,0.806,0.152,0.043,0.599508281573499
2016-06-13,5.0,"In retrospect the small plate would have been just about perfect in terms of size.  I missed lunch and thought a large might serve better and made it about halfway through the second half (the large is literally double the amount of chicken).  Overall the sauce was amazing (it is part of the crust and not a drippy messy nightmare coating it) and the chicken was extremely good (moist and tender).  The sides were also great and everyone in my group had great things to say about the biscuits. It would be nice though if they had (or offered) wet wipes.  Since there's no bathroom, and thus no sink for customers to use, cleaning up can be tough and you really want to get that hot sauce off your hands before mistakes happen (like rubbing your eyes).",0.9623,0.755,0.178,0.067,0.5479591836734694
2016-06-12,5.0,"Bang on best hot chicken I have had!!!  We split a large order of white meat ""hot"".  We didn't go for the extra hot that was seasoned with habanero: we will definitely order that next time. The order came with 2 breast/wing pieces that would've been too much for me alone. The chicken, as I mentioned, was the best I have had. Now I have had my share of chicken, and for my taste, nobody does it better! The chicken was cooked perfectly: juicy and flavored throughout. The chicken wasn't gamy at all, just a spot on beautifully flavored perfectly cooked bird.  The skin was nice and crispy.   I tend to have a bite of skin with every piece of meat. This made every bite delicious. The skin by itself was not over powering with season. Again, this adds to the experience as there was nothing off about what we had. The sides we had were equally on point. I really got this impression that the time and commitment was made to the entire experience. We had the elote and greens.  Both were perfect compliment to the chicken. The elote offered me the perfect corn sweetness as a counterpoint to the chicken. And the greens too had a very slight sweetness that complimented the chicken well. Again, both sides could have stood alone by themselves but together they enhanced.  The mango drink was excellent as well. Perfectly sweet and refreshing.   Chef John and team were extremely hospitable. I really got the sense they wanted to provide the best hot chicken experience they could. To me, they did that and more. Mind you, the place is fairly small with stool seating along the walls; probably 6 seats on the left and 8 seats on the right with outdoor seating on the sidewalk. On the day we went it was extremely warm outside so maybe on a cooler day we will enjoy the outdoor seating. Probably another 6-8 seats outside.  The point I'm making is that although small, The Budlong absolutely crushes the chicken. I guarantee you will be back!",0.9958,0.789,0.192,0.019,0.6126144688644687
2016-06-09,3.0,"Tasty stuff, and a good first impression; while this doesn't take the cake from some of my favorite fried chicken in Chicago (The Roost, Crisp, The Chicken Shack in Evanston, Big Jones, and joints like Uncle Remus and Harold's), it does feel a little more like ""date night fried chicken"", especially when it comes to higher-end ingredients and prices. I came by today and had the Hot Chicken Sandwich (X-Hot) with black-eyed peas and collards. The sauce on the chicken was my favorite part of the meal.  Very hot and spicy, but not burn-the-tongue, can't-taste-my-food hot.  Definitely cleared my nose a bit as I bit into the meat.  Very happy. The toppings on the sandwich--cole slaw, aioli, and the largest pickles I've seen on a burger or chicken sammie in quite a while--were also excellent.  But the actual chicken on the sandwich was actually pretty thin; it is smart to serve this with two sides as a requirement, because on its own, this isn't enough sandwich to be called a sandwich, really.  (At Roost or even Leghorn, you get a solid amount of chicken on the bun or biscuit.  Not so at Budlong.) The bun was great, a brioche monster that houses all of the toppings quite well...and if I had to have this on a bun, this is the bun I would want across any of the spots I've hit in town.  But I'm a biscuit man, so sue me for wanting this on what looked like pretty sweet biscuits (from what other customers were ordering). The collards and the black eyed peas were good, and they paired well with the very hot sammie.  I am curious to taste the biscuits and the elote on a future visit; I'm not sure I would get the BEPs and the collards again but they were good. I also added a vanilla bourbon shake to this meal; also very tasty, but for $6 it isn't very big.  Given how hot the sandwich was, I took one big slurp after finishing half of my sandwich, and realized that half the shake was gone.  This feels like a $3 Potbelly shake in terms of size, but $6 gets you craft ingredients and a vanilla wafer. Overall I spent about $18 on this meal; a little pricey for lunch, especially a fried chicken lunch IMHO, but again, I consider this the kind of takeout you do for a date or semi-special occasion. Service was fast, food took about 15 minutes with no one else's meals standing in the way.  About 20 seats inside along two separate shelves for dining in, and a patio on warmer days that adds another 15-20 spots.  I wouldn't bring a group of six people to break bread and spend an hour here, similar to other fried chicken spots around town like The Roost's River West location or Smalls. Next time I'll be back for a two-piece order of the dark with the sides mentioned above so that I can round out the menu.  Not a top-five for me, but very tasty.",0.9962,0.828,0.143,0.029,0.6055220734126985
2016-06-04,4.0,"The staff here is very friendly and helpful and an overall great experience. Especially the girl taking orders, I will try to catch her name and add it to this post. The food is good, I personally thought the chicken was fried a little too long as the skin is pretty dark. Look around when you get there, you'll see what it looks like. I intend on asking for mine ""golden"" next time. It still tasted good. I thought the elote could use some improvement, the corn was a little ""wrinkly"" and wasn't very tasty. The red potato salad is very chinky and yum.  The prices are decent. I would recommend instead of buying for example the large dark with 2 sides for $16 buy two smalls for $18 and you'll get the same amount of chicken but instead of 2 sides you'll get 4 for only $2 more!

2016-06-03,5.0,"We visited this place yesterday to grab some dinner - and it was such a great decision!!  We got the Hot Chicken sandwich and Xxtra hot chicken (white) with two sides.  The chicken was perfect - crunchy on the  outside and succulent underneath. We got the elote and biscuit as sides - the biscuit was crunchy and soft all at the same time (just how i like it!) and the elote (corn on the cob with butter and spice) was sweet and spicy. The food was absolutely delicious!! We will definitely be visiting again!  Warning though : that xxtra hot chicken is NOT an exaggeration! I am a huge fan of spicy food but it was too hot for even me to handle! I'm so glad there's a small piece of Nashville in the Chi! The owners of the place were super nice and chatted away with us while we were deciding on food.

It's unfortunate I never got to try Bunny the Micro Bakery, but I'm equally as excited The Budlong has officially come to Lake View!
