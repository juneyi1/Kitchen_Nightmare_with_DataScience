2015-04-30,4.0,"Definitely enjoyed this place--I think they're doing something really cool. I lived in the Mid East for a year, so my standards for good falafel are high, and I wasn't expecting much. But what's cool about this place is that it's not really trying to compete with authentic middle eastern food--it's just trying to be innovative with the cuisine and copy and apply the success of the chipotle bowl. I think it's genius. Falafel (or the different meat options) can be too messy in a pita/wrap (even though they still have that as an option on the menu), and the idea of throwing it all in a bowl instead makes it more accessible to most people. With a bowl, you can enjoy more vegetables, not spill hummus on your pants, and trick yourself into thinking you are eating something healthy--it's just a salad! (I'm only joking--you can definitely make this meal 100% guilt-free and healthy if you're careful with what you pile on at the meza bar). Most importantly, the bowl offers the possibility of a sit-down with a friend kind of lunch, rather than an eat and run.  The meza bar--all of the veggies and sides you can add to your bowl--is definitely the highlight. I generally don't like buffets because they can get real dirty real fast, but this one seemed fairly clean, and it was just too delicious-looking to pass up. And there were really interesting options besides your typical cucumber/tomato salad, tahini, hummus, babganoush, etc. There was a tabouleh quinoa salad, a bulgar salad with pomegranate sauce, a couscous with cranberries, fried cauliflower, a chickpea salad, skhug (hot sauce), a red pepper hummus, a yogurt/cucumber sauce and more.  But beware-- it's easy to have a typical case of 'your eyes are bigger than your stomach' at the meza bar!  As for the actual falafel? I had the plain falafel in my bowl, which were good, not great, but fine. My friend had the curry falafel which were really tasty--I've never had curry falafel before, but will definitely order next time. Other sides? The sweet potato fries were good (thin cut, crisp), but the house fries weren't so great--way way way too lemony and seemingly oily. All in all, with the Groupon ($15 for a Mediterranean Meal with Sides for Two at Falafill--which is a $26 Value), there really is just no reason not to try this place!",0.9899,0.815,0.141,0.043,0.5175396825396826

2015-04-24,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about Falafill. I think its the best falafel in Chicago, but not by a wide enough margin to justify its exorbitant prices. Falafel is super cheap. But a falafel at Falafill is twice the cost of other, nearly-as-good spots. That is not the only stupid thing; there are others, too. The classic, pita-pocket falafel does not come on a plate, or even a tray. It comes in a ridiculous paper envelope. This would be fine if it were pre-filled. It is not. You must take it to the salad bar. But wait! the falafel itself takes up most of the pita, so you must maneuver your scoops of Jerusalem salad past them, while trying not to spill or get sh*t all over your hand. Stupid. The pickled turnips are great, crunchy, and pink. The end",0.9044,0.769,0.15,0.08,0.5681372549019609

2015-03-14,3.0,"My daughter and I love Middle Eastern food and when I saw the Groupon for $15 for two meals, I thought we'd try it. The biggest turn off for me was not finding parking. Coming from the 'burbs I'm spoiled with parking lots. This place is off the corner of Belmont and Broadway and with only street parking, I had to drive around for at least 15-20 minutes. There is a Walgreens across the street with a lot, but I didn't want to chance getting towed. A lot of the surrounding streets are one way too so it was maddening! We almost gave up and went somewhere else when we finally found something around the corner. I saw a bunch of people on foot going in and out, so if you live in the neighborhood, I'm sure it's no hassle. The place itself is very small with only 4 tables plus some high seating in the front window. We went up to the counter and had the choice of a pocket, bowl or wrap, with our choice of filling and one side each. We both chose steak and my daughter had the pocket (1/2 a pita) and I had the bowl, which came with my choice of rice (brown or basmati) and 1/2 a pita also. We also had a choice of one side plus one trip to the mezza bar.  The portion of steak and rice I received was small, but I figured it was due to the Groupon. Fortunately I liked most of the items on the mezza bar so I filled my bowl there. The fried cauliflower was delicious! As was the various cold salads and sauces. The hummus was very good and the falafel we got for our sides were the best we've ever had! Both the standard and the curry ones were fresh, crisp, and delicious!! We got full with what we had and enjoyed the meal for the price, but due to the poor parking situation, I doubt that we'd be back.",0.9588,0.832,0.105,0.063,0.5912260536398468

Basically a Chipotle goes Mediterranean where you pick your protein, what kind of rice (brown or white), what kind of pita (only a half pita, white or wheat), then after a couple of minutes you take you stuff for the Mezzas to fill your bowl. I tried a bunch of different stuff as it was my first visit. Next time I will go with less choices, so I don't end up with the flavor overload I gave myself. Did the steak option with brown rice and wheat pita. Pita is a pita, rice was rice, meat was flavorful and moist. Nice texture. All the Mezzas I tried were pretty good.

My only substantial issue with the place is the bowls are too small to really enjoy the toppings available in the mezza bar.  There are signs all over the place saying you are only entitled to one trip to the mezza bar.  And they seem to nickel and dime you on the containers for sauces. I think they are 50 cents each.  Honestly when you are charging upwards of $8 for a bowl with less than a handful of protein, a half scoop of rice, and a mini pita, I think you can afford to give out a couple trips to the meza bar.  Or just charge a couple bucks extra for an extra bowl. I mean how much beet salad can a man eat?  It was annoying to have all my salads and sauces mixed together in one bowl. I should have sprung for a second full priced bowl I guess.

On top of that, the owner is gregarious and patient.  He was happy to spend a long time explaining the menu to us, and later wandered over to our table to proselytize in favor of living in Chicago -- an experience that happened to us over and over again as we went to other various tasty restaurants in Chicago.  What's in the water around here?",0.9638,0.853,0.147,0.0,0.5295833333333334

2013-10-10,4.0,"At Falafill, you'll find a unique twist on Middle Eastern food.  First choose your choice of filling (falafel, curry falafel, steak, chicken, or sujuk sausage,) then choose either a sandwich or a bowl, then white or wheat pita, and finally top it off with some or everything from the mezza bar.  At the mezza bar, they offer dips (humus, roasted red pepper hummus, and baba ghanouge), salads (tabbouleh, jerusalem, minted cabbage, black bean and corn, roasted beets, fried cauliflower, bazerghan, couscous, and green beans), and sauces (toum, tatziki, zough, harissa, and taratour.)  Everything is cooked to order, so be a little patient with them.  You won't regret it when you have a piping hot fresh sandwich/bowl. I have only tried Falafill's falafel sandwich and steak bowl.  I enjoyed the falafel more than the steak.  The falafels were a decent size and cooked to the right amount of crispiness.  But the steak was really chewy, too overcooked for my liking.  I like the concept of the bowl more than the sandwich because it's just less messy and you can easily distribute the sauces and veggies.  Next time, I'm going to have to get myself a falafel bowl. If you like Middle Eastern food, definitely check this place out.  The place is really clean and modern looking, the staff is patient and cheerful, and the food is delicious.  Also who can say no to an all you can eat mezza bar?  A delicious mezza bar at that.  Also prices are decent for the amount of food you can get.  You'll definitely see me coming back for more.",0.9823,0.835,0.138,0.027,0.498109243697479

Falafill keeps me out of the Five Guys across the street and from overindulging in Chipotle. The two words you need to know about Falafill are ""mezza bar."" Almost every main dish you order comes with a trip to the mezza bar, which features the most amazing veggie toppings and sauces and side dishes. I recommend getting the falafel bowl  because you still get some pita bread and can just dump mezza bar goodness into your bowl until you've suffocated the falafel balls. Hummus, baba ghanoush, veggies with zatar, taboulleh, black bean and corn salad/relish, couscous that's sweet with little raisins in it -- it's all good, nay, amazing. I love spicy, and you can zing it up with their zhug sauce or add touches of other flavors. My one knock on Falafill is that while they offer some different sides, it's falafel or bust. I would love to try some schwarma here based on how good everything else is. That said, the falafel are perfectly crispy out the outside and soft and green on the inside. You're not getting run-of-the-mill stuff. Complaining about choice here is like complaining about choice at Chipotle though -- the ingredients are so excellent that you don't need to order anything else.

With a drink and some tasty sweet potato fries, I got out of there for about $9 and change. Back to the salad bar: All the Middle Eastern salads I've grown accustomed to liking--tabouleh, bazerghen, chutneys--were there, plus a lot more I hadn't had. They also had some great sauces, including a creamy garlic sauce (toum) that I dumped over everything. I was pleased.

2011-06-06,4.0,"With the huge selection of authentic Middle Eastern cuisine lining Broadway in this part of Lakeview, why would anyone go to a fast casual Mediterranean place like this?  Isn't that kind of like going to a Qdoba in Little Village? The answer is, of course, that both that (theoretical) Qdoba and this Falafill are incredible! Unlike that champagne of carry out ""Mexican,"" however, Falafill is not yet a chain.  But if they keep up their high quality, they might very well someday be.  Each of their toppings for their four ball falafel sandwich could easily stand on its own.  Both because it tastes good enough to eat by itself on a plate and because it's hearty and healthy enough to stand by itself and walk away. Yeah, demon Jerusalem Salad, how's that for a winning marketing campaign? Anyway, said salad was stiff, fresh cucumbers and soft tomatoes which blended perfectly with the pita bread.  But a small problem is there was no indication if the bowls of the salad bar was mild or spicy (and some of the 20+ items weren't even labeled that I can remember when I was there).  While it would be hard to mess up a loaded pita here since all the salads I tried (seriously, the customer can overflow the pita without the cashier blinking an eye) were amazing, a lack of taste information makes it more likely. I would like to think that Middle Eastern fast food would cater more to beginners.  But if the customer hasn't gotten the real deal before at a sitdown place, this is not the gateway drug to my favorite type of food that it should be.  Though at only $4.95 for a relatively huge sandwich, I guess it's not that costly to experiment.  And when I can pile grape leaves on top of a pita for cheaper than a side of grape leaves down the street at Zad, I'm not really going to argue.  Just enjoy it.",0.9689,0.779,0.146,0.076,0.5681481481481481

I'd heard good things about it and it's just a block away from my apartment, so it's super convenient. I eyed the topping bar as I came in, deciding which toppings I wanted. I ordered the least expensive item, the falafill wrap, not realizing it didn't include a trip to the topping bar (apparently I need to read more closely)! Oh well. I got it without the pickles (I hate pickles), and it was sooo good. The wrap included four falafel balls, parsley, tomato, and tahini sauce. Mmmmm! Next time, I'm definitely going to go for the falafill pocket with tabouleh and perhaps some chick pea salad (or would that be a chick pea overdose?). I almost forgot to mention that everything is vegetarian, which I absolutely love. Everything on the topping bar is also clearly marked, another thing that makes me happy, but I'm not so worried here since I know there won't be any mysterious meat in my food anyway. Since it's on my way home from class, I will definitely be returning soon. According to their website, they are open until 2 am, which will certainly be nice during finals week. I'm not sure how accurate this is, since the pdf menu on their website says they're only open until 10 pm, but I think the menu is dated, as there are far fewer items on it than are actually available.

I left intrigued, satisfied and convinced that it could.  Falafill is at the heart of most of the dishes, you can choose a sandwich with 4 falafill balls, a salad with 6 falafill balls or just grab sides of falafill, the salad bar or other items. Hummus, crumbled feta or babaghanouge are extra. My girlfriend and I both got the sandwich which came with 1 trip to the salad bar. I also had the combo which came with sweet potato fries. As we waited for our sandwiches, we perused the salad bar which is filled with delicacies like tabouleh, chick pea salad, tahini sauce, and about 15 other toppings.  Then we got our sandwiches and became confused about how the salad bar works because there was no extra plate provided. Where would we put these goodies? Do we ask for a plate? Thankfully someone came in after us and we observed them closely and they put their salad bar in the sandwich, so we followed. Our sandwiches were unbelievable. The falafill was perfectly fried on the outside, yet moist on the inside -  very tasty. The accoutrements from the salad bar were a perfect addition to the sandwich. Our sweet potato fries were great as well. We had a curry aioli and another dipping sauce that was suggested by the staff, it had a cinnamon flavor to it.  So does the falafill concept work?

The falafel comes served in a paper pouch propped up in a cup,  great for photos,  bad for taking advantage of the salads on the bar.  My whole wheat (gluten free) pita was drier than granny's panty's.  It was crumbling apart before I had a chance to pile some garnishes on. The fries can be dipped into some interesting accompaniments,  such as curried aioli and some maple syrup mustard (?)  Unfortunately they were soggy and limp.  Funny thing is when they called out ""Bob""  the fry guy was holding the fries up letting the grease drip,  I thought to myself yeah fresh fries.  Fail.  The bonehead pulled them prematurely. While trying to eat these abominations,  olives were rolling down the counter,  sauce was dripping out the bottom.  The harissa was more vinegry than spicy,  the potato salad was mealy.

I pretty much gave up on the fact that me and falafel would never be friends. But because it was Easter and not too many restaurants were open around me I found myself walking into Falafill and I'm so glad I did! I ordered the Pita and added on Hummus to it (next time I might try the babaganoush). The price is very reasonable for how full you become after the sandwich. It comes with four falafel and the pita is fresh and soft. The falafal is perfectly prepared...crispy but not greasy and almost has a grainy texture to it that I really enjoyed. You can order white or wheat pita but I decided to go for the white,  The salad bar is a great addition and makes the sandwich a well rounded meal.  It is easy to go overboard with all the selections but you have to strategically peruse the salad bar first to make your decision otherwise your sandwich will become an overwhelming mish mosh. You can add salads that are made with chick peans, fava beans, a cauliflower salad just to name a few and there are a bunch of sauces- try the garlic sauce which literally looks like a garlic puree but is delicious.  At the counter they have small little containers that you can put sauces in to go (they have six to choose from).  I choose the yogurt sauce spiced with cinnamon and also the curry aioli.   I just ordered the sandwich but would be interested in trying the fries, especially the sweet potato friends.

After all, it does appear to be another fast-food, corporate chain that tries to put a new twist to an old concept at 50% success rate. That been said, I do like the large variety of salad and sauces offered at the salad bar. The store is brighly lit with urban decor, I would have totally mistaken it for a fro-yo place with the bar stool seats & colorful walls! There's only a handful of seats, maybe 4-5 pairs of table seating & 6 additional window seat.  I do think find the bar stools strange... so we get to sit at the window while passerbys look IN? mmm... Decided to give the Falafel pita sandwich a try - their whole wheat pita was already out, it's only 6pm!! There were 2 cashiers but the service was still pretty bad... there wasn't a line at all, but they just appear disengaged wishing they were somewhere else.   Waited for 10min to get my sandwich and checked out the salad bar in the mean time.  The salad bar was surprising well-stocked, ranging anywhere from Chick Peas salad - Jerusalem salad - Minced cabbage, I will say a total of 10+ variety? As a meat-lover myself, I think I can handle a couple vegetarian meals/week with Falafill's selection =)   So I grabbed my sandwich and started piling on the salads + sauces, I did like the fact that they had forks next to the soda fountain, which helped to make my meal far less messy!  The falafels were fried-to-order, fresh and crunchy, not the best I've had but superior value for the price!   I really liked the minced cabbage salad and put extra herbs in my sandwich toward the end of the salad bar!!

2010-02-23,3.0,"This place is a clean, bright, fancied-up (but watered-down) version of my favorite falafel place in DC (Amsterdam Falafel). A few things to keep in mind: 1. If you get a falafel sandwich, add whatever yougurt or tahini sauce LAST. I made the mistake of dumping in two ladles of sauce first. Soaked a hole through the bottom of the pita in minutes and toppings came flying out. 2. It's best to employ a ""keep it simple"" sort of strategy when loading up at the topping bar. The flavors and textures of the toppings are wide and varied, but unfortunately lack the intensity that I have found at other Middle Eastern eateries. Going overboard at the topping bar will result in a mishmash of undistinguishable flavors.  3. The fries are delicious...and fried-to-order, apparenly. An order of fries can most definitely be shared between two people, and then some. Then you get your choice of several self-serve fry sauces. Only reason I even eat fries is for the sauce. Best fry sauce, in my opnion, is 1 pump of curry aioli + 2 pumps of ketchup + 1 pump of mayo, mixed together. I recommend getting the falaroll, which is a tightly-rolled, pre-assembled falafel sandwich. And then, if you must, order a separate ""topping bar side."" ""Topping bar"" is a bit of a misnomer when it permits you to fill a container with such things as tabbouleh, armenian salad, roasted beets, couscous, fried cauliflower, chickpeas, pickled veggies and more.

Lots of exotic Mediterranean salads I can't even remember the names of but my tummy was quite pleased to have. But it does bring my one criticism... plates, please! I asked for a plate so I could have some of the salad just on its own and not on my falafel sandwich, with the possibility of stuffing it into the pita later on in my eating session (come on, you hate it too when the fillings of a pita aren't even all the way through!), and they just... didn't have them. I made do with a take-out lid. Doable, but not ideal. Given how messy eating a pita might be, I think plates would be awesome all around. Now I don't know personally why anyone would choose to be vegan (apart from necessity), but at least if you are, you can eat here and not feel shortchanged. You can get falafel without the pita. And if you're somewhere in between me and vegan, there's options for whole wheat pita and some gluten free combos. I'm a California girl by heart so I want to give them props for the recycling bin.

2010-02-11,4.0,"Falafill recently opened up next to our oh-so-favorite chicken spot, The Chicken Hut, on Broadway just north of Belmont. We read about this place on Metromix and figured we'd swing by to see what all the fuss was about. This place is very new, very modern, very minimalist, and very clean looking; it seemed from our first impression Falafill is to Middle Eastern Food what Chipotle is to Mexican food. When going to places that serve Middle Eastern food, I usually go with the same thing, a falafel and grape-leaf wrap, so it wasn't hard to choose what to get here - pretty standard. There isn't a crazy amount of choice, but you do get into an internal debate -- falafill sandwich (served in a white or whole wheat pita)...falaroll...falafill bowl...or a sandwich combo, which comes with fries(regular or sweet potato)and a drink?  We both decided to get the combo, which we would later regret, but not for a bad reason. Falafill's unique selling point is that you get to customize your meal.  Once you get your dish, you head over to the salad and topping bar where there are about 10 different trays of nicely labeled goodies from basic garlic and yogurt sauces to fresh veggie garnishes and hot red pepper sauces. This is where it gets interesting. I had no idea what any of this stuff was and I was making decisions based on the name. I think I put some garlic stuff in there, some green stuff, some other stuff, and some more stuff after that. Lois did the same but she was a little more restrained, adding a little garnish (the parsley, radish and red onion) and the yogurt sauce. We got back to the counter where we had set up camp and started chowing down. Surprisingly, we didn't do half bad. I wish I could tell you what I put in mine, but when it comes to a buffet style setup, there's no way I ever remember. But the bottom line, I think they create the falafel and mixers so you can't go wrong. A little bit of dill stuff, a little bit of hot stuff, and a little bit of garlic stuff -- beautiful. It's a win-win. Not to mention that they stuff the pitas with four nice-sized falafel balls, making this a very hearty portion. If you are going with someone else, save the extra cash, and order one meal and an extra sandwich. They hook you up with a ton of fries. My sweet potato fries were to die for, crispy on the outside but super soft and sweet in the middle -- but I couldn't finish them by myself. Lois ate most of her fries but couldn't finish her falafel sandwich. Seriously folks, choose wisely here because they hook it up.",0.9941,0.831,0.136,0.033,0.43473224306557645

Now, I agree with everyone who has concerns about the serving apparatus of the food. It was awkward to fill my sandwich and I put some salads around the outside of the pita just so I could spread it all out on napkins and have some for the last half of the sandwich. It was definitely very, very messy, but I had expected that.  The fries, however, definitely need a little more consideration. The way they're served in a sandwich wrapper inside a small cup makes them extremely top heavy and unstable, proven when my husband sat two of them down and one tipped right over. I turned around to see beautiful, beautiful sweet potato fries sprawled out all over the table, seat, and floor. Very sad. This would have contributed to a  4 star review because it's such an ineffective way to serve a big pile of fries; however, the service was excellent and the situation was fully remedied. I definitely did not have a poor customer service experience! The lady and gentleman on duty today were lighthearted and polite.  The price, I suppose, could have been a dollar or two less, but we both got combos and we had to bring some of our fries home. My husband and I are not small and we love our food, but we were definitely very, very full. So, in my opinion, the price was right enough that we'll definitely be back. And return we will!

Just because it looks like a  buffet bar doesnt mean you get to eat out like a pig on it. or to simplify it you can get a salad bowl which is about 2 and some dollars more. which is ol i guess since one of the cashiers told me that what costs them the most is their salads instead of the falafel.anyways its a good concept even though its all deep fried. but they use canola oil and it has less calories than chipotles steak burrito.  oh and btw the times i've been there, i always have to hear the one person ask ""so how does this work"" after they have stared at the menu for hours (not complety but still).",0.3071,0.942,0.038,0.02,0.46736111111111106

2010-01-03,3.0,"Falafill is a clean restaurant where you can satisfy some hunger pangs with essentially one menu item - falafel.  I've only had the falafel sandwich (in white and wheat pita), but have always been impressed with the texture, size, and preparation of the falafel. The fixin' bar is pretty good.  I especially like the variety of ""salads"" you can throw onto your sandwich (chick pea, beet, fava bean, and bulgar wheat are real standouts).  For the most part, these are ""fresh"" tasting, although sometimes the chick peas have a slightly old/canned taste.   I'm also a big fan of the pickled veggies (including turnips!). Service is actually pretty fast.  Since the falafel is prepped to order,  you might have to wait 3 minutes for it to fry.  But that's no biggie. Sweet potato fries are good, and preferable to the regular fries, but you know what?  They're fried out of a frozen bag.  Nothing special there.  There isn't anything special about the pita either; it's just mass-produced flour-board serving as a vehicle for tasty falafel. The combo meals are at least one dollar and maybe two dollars too expensive.   I only get sandwiches there now.

The falafel sandwich was perfectly yummy, I put a cucumber sauce and the garlic tahini dressing on top. Yum! I do agree with other reviews that the packaging part is a little odd, it's fine, but a plate or a larger paper wrapper would help in case you overdo it with the toppings.

2009-10-10,3.0,"Falafill is a small, cozy food stop with a distinctive modern flair.  It certainly doesn't remind me of most other falafel places which tend to be fast food joints with flourescent lighting (sometimes flickering and causing mild seizures) with a distinctly annoyed looking server behind the counter.  Maybe I keep hitting the bad, shady ones?? ick. The ambience reminds me of red mango...it's welcoming, brightly lit and beautiful.  It's hippish, cool, and the colors are not the boring blue, black, red.  It's like flashy orange, flashy green.  You know whoever runs the place has attention to detail.  The menus are clear and crisp, the font face is a blend of Tahoma, Verdana, and Arial which is pleasing to the eye.  The drinks are distinctive...they want to be taken seriously.  Instead of plastic or aluminum coke cans, they sell the elongated bottle version which i don't know about you, is very rare...or you can go less bold, and go fountain style.  They also sell the several Middle Eastern drinks.  Nice touch, however, water is expensive.  Sorry, I try to eat healthy and have water with my meals. Their falafels are crisp and good...admittedly I am not a pro when it comes to falafels so I can't comment on authenticity.  But you imagine that if their name is a play on falafels, these brown balls of delectability (is that a word) better be good.  I tried the hummus, and I suppose it could be better because I don't remember much about it. Falafels come in salad or pita version...it depends on what you prefer.  The salad version is a dollar or two more expensive at around $7 but comes with a bed of lettuce and a few more falafel balls.  There is a salad bar and you get a complimentary all-you-can-fit-into-your-pita-or-salad-bowl helping.  The salad bar is a welcoming addition.  I did not expect that, so being mindful of getting my money's worth, I loaded my salad bowl with salad.  I covered the falafels with so much salad, I couldn't see the falafels, and it was just a mountain of salad.  I bet someone thought I was weird, but I am just being very mindful of getting my money's worth. In that sense, I think you do get your money's worth but with the salad version.  With the pita, you can only fit so much into the pita. The sweet potato fries are pretty good.  It's expensive but good.  You have your choice of various condiments, so I tried the spicy ketchup and that works wonders.  What keeps making me wonder is why are there so many ethnic places that pair ethnic food with FRENCH FRIES.  I'm Chinese and I walked into a Chinese restaurant one time and they served buffalo wings.  Man, I don't get it.  I guess America's security blanket is french fries and buffalo wings because we can't trust ethnic food side dishes. The people behind the counter are friendly.  I think the cashier I keep handing my credit card too wears a lion hat, which made me stop and think for a couple seconds.  Totally unexpected but very cool. The bottom line is this is a nice place to fill your stomach with a different variety of foods rather than the chipotle or chicken hut nearby.  Cozy, nice, comfortable, but doesn't blow you out of the world.  I recommend the salad version since you get more of your money's worth via a friendly helping of the salad bar, and you don't eat clumsily with the pita version (admittedly, need to improve the way the pita version is presented because it tends to be messy, and this can lead to bad consequences...i.e. pita/salad stuffs fall on your shirt ruining your day because you couldn't hold onto the pita well, or the pita/salad stuffs fall on your girlfriend/boyfriend's shirt, ruining his or her day and great, you just ruined both of your days).  Stick with the salad and you avoid the potential of ruining days.

No plates here. But I get that, because they are trying to go ""green,"" which I LOVE. The disposable cups, silverware, and cardboard cartons are all compostable, meaning, they will biodegrade. NICE.

Falafel fast food(ish) joint with a nice little ""salad"" bar type of setup including lots of lovely little accompaniments for your ""chickpea balls rolled in oil, deep fried.""  You order, then you pile it up with the stuff on the salad bar. One trip only, they make this really clear. Maybe they had problems in the past with it? I'm not sure there's really a way to go back twice...but, whatever, don't. Ok?  Little bit of seating, but meant more as an ""eat 'n run"" kind of thing. Interior is spunky. Clean. Greens and oranges, almost sterile...but hey, that's cool. I can enjoy the falafel high in any color theme, for real.  I decided on a falafel sandwich with whole wheat pita + a fountain Diet Coke (+1, yay!). It comes out in this box type contraption, hmmm...alright. I throw some random stuffs on it, pile it with cucumbery  sauces and delightfully Americanized-Medi sides, and am on my way to sit and enjoy.  Then it all falls apart.  No, really. The pita just sort of...falls apart. And this box thing it sits in is flimsy and, I can't really eat it as a sandwich since it decided to just die on me.

As you're waiting in line to order your food, there is a fridge with an array of uncommon beverages to choose from. I wanted to try them all! I came in only wanting to order the falafel balls, (but if you do that, you aren't allowed to go to the salad bar or grab any sauce!), so I ordered the falafel sandwich instead.  The sandwich (which comes in wheat or white) came packed with around 4-5 falafel balls, and a tiny spoonful of lettuce at the bottom. This of course left more room add toppings, or so I thought.  I went up and tried a little bit of a few of the toppings and sauces (most of which were things I had never put on falafel). I didn't want to load it up, just in case I didn't like something. After I had eaten the top third, I had nothing but falafel at the bottom.  Now what to do? There's a big sign that said ""only one trip to the salad bar"". Shit. At that point, I had to make a decision. Once I realized I like the garlic sauce the best, I slyly grabbed a cup, scooped some in their and that is what I stuck with.  Unfortunately, that garlic taste stayed with me the REST of the day as well. But, that's what happens when you're a garlic lover...  Overall, this is a cute spot to grab a quick bite, but I'm not a fan of the complicated toppings situation...",-0.319,0.87,0.059,0.071,0.506231884057971

If you want something cheap, go get something at the dollar menu from McDonalds.",0.94,0.736,0.17,0.095,0.6599999999999999

2009-09-04,3.0,"I have to say, it was darn good falafel.  I dig the salad bar - I loaded up with some things I had never tried before and was pleasantly suprised.  You get a choice of regular or wheat pita.  Awesome.  So yeah, they have that part going for them.  Kudos. Plus, it's a cool looking little place.  Bright orange and green decor, modern feel, and extremely clean.  Plus the guy who helped me at the counter was super friendly.   However, Falafill, man, you gotta get some to-go containers.  I ripped the tissue paper holding my monstrous creation TWICE walking down Broadway, and nearly lost the entire thing.  Considering the inside of your joint is so small and can't seat many anyway, it's a good idea to have some take-home packaging.  But here's the real issue I've never understood at falafel joints.  Your combo side option is french fries?  THAT'S what you're gonna pair with falafel?  It just doesn't work for me.  I don't want ketchup smothered 'taters next to my hummus.  Eh, personal opinion. So I'll let that one go. The falafel and salad bar were delish, and that's what really counts anyway.",0.9834,0.788,0.179,0.033,0.4640932738758827
2009-09-04,4.0,"This is a long-overdue format, which is popular on the East Coast, and if I recall from my trip 16 years ago, Israel.  I ordered the ' falafil salad' which is just 6 falafel balls on lettuce to take up space so you don't overdo it on the salad bar.  No bread. I think I ordered correctly -- a little more space for the good stuff, at little more cost.  There was something else on the menu which wasn't explained, something like ""falafasand salad."" A little explanation? The crispy falafel itself might be just a little bland for my falafel-snob tastes (disclosure: I came to love Lebanese-style falafel in SE Michigan, a little spicier and rolled up instead of the sloppy, uneven stuffed method ubiquitous here), but the accoutrements pick up the slack and I will be back. They have toum, a delicious garlic sauce, one of the best things for falafel.  The tabouleh is the kind i don't like -- more bulgar than parsley.  Beets, pickles (including pickled ginger, a surprise winer), carrot salad -- all the toppings were solid. Nothing outstanding, but quite satisfying for what it is.  I wonder what is made fresh, what comes frozen and what comes canned?  The cost is a couple bucks more than the in-and-out Sultans, where you just get falafel and hummous, and if you want 'salad' on it you pay by the pound, and therefore could pay quite a bit more.  As to complaints from people who overstuffed their sandwiches and made a mess--? be reasonable.  It's not a buffet and if they give you a bucket for condiments they will quickly go broke. I had the best ginger ale I can recall (and I have been on the prowl for years), which was $3. Walgreeens is across the street if you want swill soda.

Think there's a FEW places on Belmont and/ or Broadway with better Falafil, so I wonder how long they will really draw up business. That said, if you do go, make sure you try the pickled carrots - those were awesome. Oh yeah, and the picture in this article, is not helpful at all.

2009-09-02,4.0,"If you are the type of person who does not like your foods touching on your plate (and you all know who you are), Falafill is definitely not the place for you. I had the advantage of living not too far from here, so I unloaded my overstuffed pita on to a plate when I got home and enjoyed it that way.  I did not know exactly what I was eating at any given moment because everything mixed together to form a  super mega hodge podge of toppings. I had a little garlic here, some eggplant there-- but whatever I was eating was so yummy that I'm contemplating going back for a late dinner!   I agree with some of the other reviews though-- even though you can put any and as much toppings as you want, you are really limited by the space left in your pita!  For the price one pays for a sandwich or a bowl, don't tempt us with your deeelicious toppings and leave us with a small crack of room!  Ditch the useless lettuce at the bottom , and maybe I'll be coming here at least once a week! 3.5 out of 5 (minus .5 for useless lettuce)",-0.5128,0.811,0.089,0.1,0.3676065162907269

2009-09-02,2.0,"As soon as I heard this restaurant coming up I was excited to try it out. Something unique and creative in the neighborhood. I decided to try it out when I was around the area in lunch time. I walked in the quick service restaurant and the cashier was on the phone but still promptly greeted me. He then asked if I had been there before and I told him that I was new. He explained to me the different options I had. I chose the regular pita falafill and I decided to get a side of potato fries too since it was only $0.85. That's where I was wrong. The menu was very confusing and the side of fries was actually $3.50, a very heft price for a side of fries. The fries were served in a large cup, BUT tissue paper was in the bottom of the cup so it wasn't even that large amount of fries to begin with. I saw some side like spicy ketchup that sounded great to try, but it was all out, as well as several other condiments. When I got down to the bottom of the fries I ended up digging in the tissue paper a bit before I gave up. The fries also were room temperature and the heat lamp they were under was not quite keep them hot. Not fresh at all.  The pita sandwich itself was good, and I went through the buffet and topped it with my choice ingredients. However, when you ate it, it was hard to get a bite with everything mixed together as it it layered from top to bottom. It would be much better if it could be mixed up together somehow. Be ready for a messy experience, and do not think you can sit down your sandwich because everything will fall out. I experienced just that. There is no holder for the pita and no plate. I found myself building a moat of napkins if I wanted to set it down to get a refill. I ended up just taking the sandwich up with me so it wouldnt spill out and make more of a mess. Overall, I understand that this place just opened but they have a lot to fix. They were not busy when I entered and could have had fresh fries made for customers to keep them happy and not just saving money leaving fries under heat all day. I paid almost $10 for pita sandwich and fries. I could get a restaurant meal for that price in a sit down place! This place would easily have gotten one star if the sandwich didn't taste as good as it did. CAREFUL: The buffet has olives WITH PITS. So if you take a big bite of that sandwich, make sure not to crack your tooth.",0.9285,0.811,0.11,0.079,0.5122803682106007

2009-08-31,3.0,"Fala-dont--fill-me up to much, more like it. Some things I really get and like. Other things I dont. Since I am generally positive person I will start with the highlights. I actually enjoyed the falafel and the toppings. I thought it had good spice and large balls. Love me some large balls. I splurged for the feta and herbs for an extra $1.00. No shock there if you know me well. Overall, it was a great and filling meal, although I have absolutely no idea what I ate. They have the general stuff (taboulleh, eggplant salads, american salads, etc) The sandwich will run you $4.95 and the salad $6.95. The drinks and sides were quite pricey, most running at least $3.00. $3.00 for french fries? I will buy me a lifetime supply of Ore-ida for that price. However, stop the presses. What is the deal with no side cups? First of all, you have got all these toppings and sauces (about 8 toppings/salads and 10 sauces) and no opportunity to taste. I ask the lady at the counter what I should do and she says ""just put them all on!"" Well then how do I know what I liked and what I didnt? That operation seems flawed? Also, what should I do about sauces if I want to take it home? What if I need a sauce refill at the end? She said they dont have cups because it is an added cost. We all know you will just pass the cost on to me so bring on the damn cups! Also, the sandwich comes in a little waxy paper. Thats it. No tray. No basket. A piece of wax paper. What the hell am I supposed to do with this? Give me some respect!  The way to go is A la Flattop Grill. Move the falafel to the side and stuff as many toppings in as possible. Really make sure you get your $4.95 worth. You will have to take some things back out in the end, but think of it as temporary storage. I would try everything, as they all seem to have pretty good taste. The garlic sauce and yogurt sauce were top notch. The spinachy-saucey stuff at the end of the counter was very tasty too. I got that recommendation from the guy in line behind me and I would agree. It was good! Here is what I recommend:  1. Order the sandwich ($4.95) and take it to go.  2. Jam pack that thing like your life depends on it and put sauces everywhere in that wrapper.  3. Smile at the staff as you feel you won the battle 4. Hold it in one hand as you drive home (easier in the car than the bike).  5. Watch out for bikers - A swerve could cause a mess 6. Get home and unload the thing on a place and make it into your own salad. Perfect! Also, limited street parking in the 'hood. I recommend biking or walking ...or just going somewhere else!",0.9939,0.807,0.142,0.051,0.4735301735301735
2009-08-31,4.0,"A cheery, brightly-colored falafel joint right around the corner from my apartment?  I'm there. Although a tad overpriced for a falafel joint, Falafill does sport an extensive toppings bar and the falafels themselves are certainly delicious.  If you get the combo meal, do note that the portion of fries is pretty large - I think big enough to share.  The cup they give you for the drink is enormous, as well.  Share that too, while you're at it. The place is small.  My friends and I had to juggle our falafel/drink/fries combo (no trays here) for a few minutes until seats freed up (which didn't take long, but we weren't there at a peak time either). They were out of sweet potato fries and Coke Zero.  This was displeasing.

2009-08-29,1.0,"Contrary to all the good reviews here, this restaurant failed me. i had never been so mad for such a long time... 1) this place is small. i wanna eat-in and there's no seats... and that's just the beginning of my bad experience. 2) its lunchtime and there are LOTS of people... there is a long line to order, and a longer time to wait for your food. i dunno how long i waited, but i had at least finished half cup of my drink (no ice) before the food is ready... so that must be a very very long time 3) how could you offer a combo meal with additional fries and drinks without trays?! mind you, there are no empty tables around your shop, its damn crowded, and your customers still have to fill up at the salad bar to complete the meal.  4) it doesnt matter if the salad bar is full of goodies, based on the tiny pita/salad bowl ur plate is filled up just with the sauce... im not kidding.. if you get a lid for the salad bowl, you might as well skip the salad bar or ur lid wont shut. 5) after struggling with my tiny salad bowl, and cup of fries, and drink in my hand around the crowded shop without a tray, i asked for a to-go bag and they do not even have a bag with handles like a normal shop do. their bags are tiny and it doesn't really help at all! one bag for my salad-bowl and one bag for my fries? no handles? oh come on! 6) and finally, they charged $3.50 for sweet potato fries and it comes in this large sized paper cup, and you thought it a great deal? you wish. about 1/3 of the cup is stuffed with wax paper (not even oil-absorbent paper)...so what you get is even way less than the McDonald's portion. Forget about the ""eye-candies"" and fancy aesthetics, because what ultimately draws customers are the service and the food... considering the prices they charged and how they doesn't even get their act together, this restaurant is an epic-fail.

But wait there's more, then you get to top your sandwich with anything at the salad bar, including tabouli, pickled ginger, miso tahini and about 12 other things I can't remember.

You get you pita quickly with four freshly made falafel balls which have a nice crisp to them but are also moist in the middle.   Take your pita, turn around and take a single step to the salad bar and fill it up as much or as little as you like. The salad offerings are good and all the  basics are included.  I had the eggplant salad and the pickled turnips.  There are many more to choose from.  There are also a few surprises which i didn't expect to see like mango chutney and pickled ginger.   Take another step and you are out the door, only $5.50 poorer but with a filling and tasty lunch or dinner in your hands. At this point, the place is brand new and shiny with all of the stainless steel equipment and bowls gleaming.  As long as they keep the place clean as time goes on this will become a neighborhood favorite.
