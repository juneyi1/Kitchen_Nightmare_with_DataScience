Where do we go from here?  Comparable sushi and sashimi?  It's silly how hard it is to even find a sushi place that a) has REAL CRAB, always  b) has big chunks of delicious tuna in the spicy tuna rolls (as opposed to some sort of tuna salad that was run through a food processor).   Itto was my happy place, my safe haven, my special joint. I don't know if I'll ever find the same amount of contentment in a restaurant again.   Thank you to all of the employees for all of your years.  You've set the bar high and will not be forgotten.  I've got my tshirt, anniversary kitty bank and fond memories as souvenirs.

The sushi was fantastic along with the tempura and other appetizers! Delicious and perfect! The only complaint I have is the wait, at least an hour or more with no main dish, when it did come, it was kinda burned and tastes awful, maybe because it was crowded and they were rushing, the waiter was very understanding and took it off our bill, a nice cute little place overall, very sad to see it go. I have to say I think the reason our visit was chaotic was because of the day we chose- Saturday night the week before they close with no reservations...

Our waiter gave us warm towels to wipe our hands which is very Japanese.  We ordered the Katsu Curry and Katsu Don. The place is fairly pricey for the amount you get. The portion sizes may be smaller than what we are used to, because traditional Japanese portions are actually smaller. The Katsu Curry ($13) although the tasted and came with plentiful curry for the rice, they could have been a bit more generous with the Katsu. The Curry itself was spiced well and the little pieces of potato, carrots, and meat tasted amazing.  The Katsu Don is Katsu mixed with egg, and scallion slices. The egg was so silky and flavorful. The Katsu it self was just breaded Portland tasted like what it is. The star was the egg.",0.9492,0.891,0.109,0.0,0.5161764705882353
2016-05-30,5.0,"One of my clients from Japan recommended Itto and told me he believed it to be the most authentic sushi in the city. While I won't pretend to know what constitutes or doesn't constitute authentic sushi, I can say this- it certainly stands apart from the trendy cookie cutter sushi joints that dot Lakeview, Lincoln Park, and much of the north side. Their fish was extremely fresh and high quality, and the menu included a lot of less common dishes that you won't find in most other places. While I thought it was fantastic and look forward to going back, be warned, if you're accustomed to mayo-heavy rolls that mask the taste of the fish, this may not be your jam, and that's okay- that's just how they roll (BOOM!).",0.8683,0.882,0.103,0.016,0.5035396825396825

Don't eat the americanized rolls; this is not the place to go for that junk.

2016-05-06,4.0,"Itto certainly has the old school authentic Japanese restaurant charm. We came here once almost two years ago, and it was the perfect food for a cold winter night. The menu can be overwhelming. A lot of text and a lot of options. But there are a lot of popular favorites along with some unlikely new things you don't find at generic trendy sushi restaurants that offer Japanese entrees an afterthought.  Everything is plated with a lot of love and care, and food does take a while to come.Some udon soup, a few pieces of sushi, a little light fried apps - great for winter. Everything was fine, tasted good, but nothing super memorable.  Most recently, we came for something ""light yet satisfying"" on a warm spring day where we ate way too much junk food during the day. And it fit that bill too! We shared a bento combination entree type thing - i love that kind of variety, an appetizer, and some soup. It was just the right amt of food for a light meal for 2. Even the fried pork was light enough to not overwhelm us.  I also ordered the monkfish liver with ponzu sauce on a whim, and it was delicious! Creamy like you'd expect liver to be, but distinctly fish, and brightened by the ponzu. Give it a try if you're adventurous :) In terms of the bento, Renga Tei beats them for variety and taste at the same price point - that is a box I'd drive out of the way for, and Itto is a restaurant I'd happily go to if I still lived in the neighborhood.

Itto Sushi is one of my favourite Japanese restaurants in Chicago that actually serves authentic Japanese food and not over-sauced, deep fried, maki sushi (although there are some non-traditional rolls).

I have had their other ramens, donburis, and udons and they were pretty good too. If you're feeling adventurous and not sure what to get, ask for the omakase which comes in two forms: sushi omakase or entree omakase. Omakase is chef's choice and here, the minimum is $50 but they will ask you if you would like a specific budget.

2015-09-21,5.0,"Finally was able to come here for Friday dinner around 8:30pm. Haven't been able to find a go-to spot that was authentic, fresh, and affordable, but Itto easily filled that spot. So many sushi spots in the city are just mediocre and forgettable, but Itto is where it's at. There is a parking lot in the back. I found it odd as we nearly parked in a spot in the rather small lot before the valet guy approaches us. Felt like valet there is unnecessary, but it is free. Just tip the guy. We entered through the back and were seated promptly while the place was nearly at capacity. We were given hot towels which I enjoy. The space is actually bigger than it appears on the outside. There is a center bar with tables around both sides with another bar on the side. Def a no-frills type of place but it was comfortable and definitely not a hole in the wall. The ambiance added to the authenticity of the place. In addition, all the staff I saw were actually Japanese. Boo and I got one uni nigiri (sea urchin), negi maki (beef scallion rolls), tantan ramen, hot tuna maki, spider roll, chef's special roll, and a winter roll. The negi maki came out at a decent time. These were so delicious! Definitely recommend getting these. The beef was so tender and nearly melted in my mouth. The scallion paired perfectly with it and the sauce sealed the deal. It wasn't too sweet and actually kinda light which shows that it is a legit teriyaki. After this dish, the rest of our orders took a very long time to come. We actually waited about an hour and having not even inquired about the status on our food, our waiter brings us some complimentary tuna dishes and apologizes for the wait, which was nice. Most of the time, the restaurant rarely initiates or recognizes their faults first. During this wait though, our waters were constantly refilled, which is a definite plus. The rest of our dishes eventually comes. The ramen was quite satisfying. Noodles were cooked well and broth was light and savory, but not spicy like it was supposed to be. The piece of pork was very dry. The uni nigiri was delightful. The hot tuna maki looked super fresh and had quite the kick to it. While I am a spicy addict, there was some flavor in there that did not suit my taste. I was a little skeptical of selecting the surprise chef's roll, but this was a great idea, as the chef is really on point here. We received a salmon avocado roll with salmon roe scattered and it was great. The spider roll was also very solid. The winter roll was delicious and very unique. I've never had hot or cooked maki rolls before, but this worked well. I could taste each component separately but it all came together at the same time. Overall, all their rolls were made very well. Each piece had much more fish than rice. Fish seemed very fresh. You're not going to find crazy concocted maki rolls with gross amounts of mayo and cream cheese here, so move along if what you really want is ""fusion."" They do have a few creative dishes here (seasonal rolls) which are tasty. Not only is this place authentic but the prices are definitely at least a couple bucks cheaper than most other places and their sushi is as good if not better than some of the higher end places.

It's been there since the early 80s, way before there was sushi in every grocery store and an assembly-line sushi joint on every corner. I've never been when there wasn't at least one table of Japanese expatriates or business travelers. The fish is always incredibly fresh, flavorful, and cut in thick, juicy portions. Plus they always have the items that the cookie-cutter places just don't tend to stock, such as uni and natto. The  quality is at least comparable to the super-fancy sushi places (Mirai, Kamehachi, etc.), if not better in some cases, but the prices are much more reasonable, the food less gimmicky, and the atmosphere far more pleasant.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that in recent years they always have multiple TVs blaring - though if you come on a slow night and sit in the patio section they might turn it off if you ask. And even so, I will take authentic, top-quality sushi in a chill neighborhood setting over tarted-up rolls amidst noisy crowds of drunk yuppies any day!

Since my mother was visiting from Japan, we were really excited to dine at Itto Sushi since so many reviews mention how authentic this restaurant is. We were absolutely disappointed not because the food was mediocre but both food and service were absolutely awful. So awful that I'd feel really sad to read anyone calling this place authentic. Sushi rice was old, stale, and dry, possibly from the previous day, and it crumbled, and it was coated with so much wasabi. Okay I'd take the fact that this is in Chicago and fish is not really fresh and too expensive for its qualify. After all, we don't live in California or NY. But shari, the foundation of sushi, this sushi rice made by a Japanese chef, is simply unacceptable. I'd enjoy sushi in my neighborhood (Hyde Park) made by non-Japanese chefs a lot more. My mother and I had to speak up to the waitress, who brought the owner's wife. She admitted that the chef used the old rice because they did not want to waste it and every sushi chef does it-- I am sorry, but I've worked as waitress at a few sushi restaurants in California, and that is unheard of. She continued to say that the American customers won't know the difference anyway so she did not think it was a big deal (we were speaking in Japanese). Our jaws just dropped and we were speechless. What a disappointment and embarrassment to see a Japanese-run restaurant in a posh neighborhood getting away with such poor quality sushi! By the way, I am not some kind of sushi-snob.

Simple, quality, authentic sushi with great technique and decent prices.  And natto!! My companion claims the Uni she had that night was the best she's ever tasted.  I can't give Itto five stars for two reasons:  - the restaurant varied between super warm and stuffy and chilly on the same evening. Though this detracted only a little away from an otherwise cute place, it did make me uncomfortable at a few points during the meal.  - I wasn't wowed by the quality of the fish.

Our dinner was delicious, although it was a little slow, but they were quite busy and we were happy to wait. The first course was some fish cake with potato in a light sweet brother. For the second course there was little deep fried eggplant with shrimp stuffed in the middle. The third course was a delicious crab and octopus salad with a light vinegar dressing. The crab was sweet and the octopus was very tender. I really enjoyed this course. Then we had a nice plate of sashimi with all different types of tuna as well as some halibut. The quality of the fish was excellent and the portions were quite generous. Then there was a large plate of nigiri and sushi rolls. One of the rolls had shiso leaf and salted plum which was very refreshing. Then we got to pick our dessert. I had the mochi cake and my husband had the green tea pudding. Everthing was delicious.

He was the only one working the sushi bar the couple times I have been in and that's a tall order.  I ordered a special baked roll and it took over 40 minutes. I wasn't in a big hurry, but it seemed like a long time. They obviously have some regulars and they definitely get some special treatment.

The spicy salmon was delicious - the spiciness starts off kind of subtle and it turns into quite the kick even after you're done with the piece! The fall roll has a spicy sauce with super white tuna and mushrooms with tiny rice cracker balls on the outside - it was quite interesting! We really enjoyed it. The spider roll was different from other places - we both couldn't really decide if we liked it or not; will have to give it another shot. With such a variety of appetizers and rolls, I will definitely go back and try everything.

First impression upon walking in - the staff greeted us very warmly, and the space is cute for a sushi restaurant. Unfortunately, I have more to say... The menus and cups of water with ice were brought out. Exhausted from playing volleyball that night, I went for a taste, but it tasted... off. I looked at the water and found whitish bits floating in both of our glasses. Now, my imagination is going crazy because: 1) flecks like the ones I saw are NEVER a good thing and they're in both cups, not to mention the taste 2) I watch too much Restaurant Impossible and Robert says bacteria can come from the ice maker if it's not cleaned... So I gave them the benefit of the doubt about the ice. After telling him about it, my b/f politely asked for a new glass of water without ice and the waitress took his glass away. She came back and I observed it - same flecks of whatever floating around! OK,not happy... but again, benefit of the doubt - what if it's just the tap water? Far fetched for me, but I didn't want to cause a ruckus over it before getting our food, so we ordered. However, I will admit that I did go to the bathroom and cupped my hands to see if there was anything in the tap out of there... and it ran clean. I ordered a hot green tea and it tasted fine, but the water really put me off. The menu is typical Japanese fare, nothing stood out except for the pricing of chicken teriyaki ($14) versus the beef teriyaki ($21). The beef was $7 more? The first time we go to new places, we try to order some staple foods so that we can compare them more evenly across the board, so in Japanese places that's least some kind of teriyaki chicken/beef, and salmon (among other things, these are our most common choices). The chicken teriyaki entree above was very, very, *very* underwhelming all around - the chicken was pale and unseasoned and the teriyaki sauce was no aid because it was thin and not flavorful. I would have been pissed if I had ordered the beef and it tasted like that. Mind you that while I'm comparing this to something like Renga-Tei's teriyaki which is fairly thick, the sauce at Itto had no flavor. Just, so disappointed. Sushi freshness: was ok, but not absolute fresh or anything like that. Sashimi ok. Rolls? Only thing I remember was this crunch roll, but they used something that tasted like *cereal* crunchy bits instead of panko or whatever. Needless to say, it ruined the roll for both of us.  I like to say give places a second chance, but this experience wasn't the best and I don't foresee a second trip anytime soon. If by some chance I end up here again, you bet I'll be rolling my eyes the minute I see Itto.",0.9247,0.815,0.109,0.076,0.5528444825614637

We were still stuffed!  It wasn't as fancy/inventive as Macku's or Arami's, but the price is also very reasonable.  If you like the good old traditional japanese food, this omakase is for you. We had a good combination of the kitchen food and sushi/sashimi.  The best part was that i got to check out dessert that are on the regular dessert menu that yet i have never had. Well, we are usually stuffed after dinners, so we normally skipped dessert unless the combination came with icecream...but the omakase allows you to pick one from the dessert menu, so hey, i will worry about the calories later! :P I love their coffee jello parfaits (and i am not a jello fans and i probably ate all the jellos!) and the mochi cake!

2012-02-13,5.0,"This review update is for the omakase alone. First let's get the definition out of the way: omakase is a traditional Japanese concept where instead of ordering food from the menu, the customer lets the chef surprise the customer with food that the chef thinks is best/fresh/good based on seasonal ingredients. Omakase is also a great way to reflect on how creative the chef is. Itto does not mention this on their menu but as you would expect from an authentic Japanese restaurant like this whose many customers are made up of Japanese businessmen and Japanese families, the chefs at Itto happily offer omakase to any customers who would like them. They were very flexible in their omakase concept and basically it was up to us how much we wanted to spend per person and based on our wanted price (we decided on $50/pp), they will prepare the food items for us which consisted of the categories of sashimi, sushi, and kitchen food. We loved the surprise element of omakase where every course presented to us was, yes, a surprise and decided by the culinary creativity of the chef. It also helps that we aren't picky eaters and will eat anything. Many of the items we got were not on their regular menu as well: 1.

2011-12-31,4.0,"I really wish I was a big sushi person, but I'm really just starting out on my venture into raw fish. I've been to a few sushi restaurants, but wanted to try something new for New Year's Eve. After researching my fellow yelpers reviews, the three of us headed to Itto Sushi. Easy to find, check. Free valet parking (plus tip), check. Friendly staff, check. Great ambiance, er,...um,...so this is where the restaurant could use some work. It is way too quiet in this place.  I mean, if I was the ultimate eavesdropper, this would be heaven. However, I'm a loud talker and don't necessarily want my table neighbors hearing all my inside jokes (they may steal my material, after all). Also, we were seated in the corner of the far dining room, which seemed to be ""baby land"" AKA the place where all the families with babies were seated. Fine, but it just added to the whole ""I can hear everything you are talking about"" vibe. Music would have been nice.  Second, with prices for combos being in the mid to high $20's, I expected some cloth napkins. That's just me. This place keeps itself in the paper napkin category, but I think it deserves to be more. With that, I continue my list: Clean bathrooms, check. Fresh sushi, check.  For being one of my first sushi places, I was impressed. There were definitely those ""things"" that avid sushi lovers eat (I imagine), such as squid and clams, etc. But there were sweet potato rolls, tempura rolls, and edamame for all those dabbling sushi-hearter wannabes. Three people, one pitcher of beer, and a soda later, our bill came to about $100 with tip. Not bad considering this was our New Year's Eve ""celebration.""

You want a natto roll? They've got it. You want an ume shiso roll, it's on the menu and paired for heavenly flavor. It's not the kind of sushi restaurant where the menu is limited due to the ineptness of it's clientele.  ++++ LOVE the freshness of the fish.

Food: The menu is pretty diverse, and even if you're not a sushi fan, there will be something that will pique your interest. Turning to the sushi, contrary to a few reviews, their fish is of excellent quality. Moreover, the maki selection is pretty diverse, with less than 20% Americanized combinations (which aren't bad necessarily, but not what I typically like to get). I really appreciate the fact that their chili tuna has no mayo and is actually spicy. Further, they have the best salmon skin maki I've ever had and I invariably use it as a baseline to compare any other salmon skin rolls I get elsewhere. They also have some interesting vegetarian options that go beyond boring old cucumber and avocado. I haven't tried their nigiri or chakin since I like certain maki combinations so much, but I'll resolve to give it a shot next time I go. However there's no reason to think that they wouldn't be as excellent since the same ingredients are used more or less.

There are generally 2 waitresses, but the one that was there today seems to always be there. Very SLOW unless you are Japanese and the sushi chef seems to know you. Mind you, I am Japanese (and of course my Mom is). We walked in and no one else was there except 2 guys at the sushi bar who were done. We get our menus and water and literally wait over 10-12 minutes for the waitress to come over to get our order.  We ask for tea - which apparently they brew each cup separately. Another couple comes in and get menus. I start timing how long it is going to take to get their order in. Try almost 15 minutes.  A group of 4 -possibly Japanese nationals -older like Mom - walk in and they get their menu, and order within 5 minutes,  We ask for more tea, and wait and ask 3 times, She brings new cups and leaves the old ones. The table of 4 get their new cups of tea and she takes their old ones. Food service is pretty good.  Spider roll not that great - basically rice which was not that seasoned, with lettuce, crab, cucumber - no other flavor, try Tokyo Marina for a really tasty roll. We went to Itto Sushi because we have had another waitress - very nice and considerate AND we ordered the lunch boxes which are decent and tasty. I wish I knew the name of this waitress- I dread having her- she acts like she doesn't care -and any one who has been a waitress knows that a good waitress carries a tray, and when she brings something, she takes something back if possible, from any of her tables. Will I go back there for their bento boxes?? No, I will look for another place. By the way, this is the first time ever I have written a review for any place and left less than 18% tip.

It was packed and we were actually skipped during the seating process twice. Finally, we were seated and we ordered some beer. Now we went with the pitcher, but I would highly recommend not doing that, as well will not in the future. It was not the value it seemed it may be. Actually, I would just stick with bottles and forget all about the beer on tap. Anyway. Moving to the menu and food. The menu at Itto is pretty big. In addition to a boat load of sushi, sashimi, and the usual strange roll combinations that all of us in America love, they had a whole menu of Japanese appetizers. Oh I know what you are thinking, ""but all sushi places have appetizers."" True. But not like Itto. This place has so many of the dishes that you find on menus in Japan, such as the simmered daikon radish with miso, the Japanese pickles, Japanese mushrooms just steamed or simmered, the best fried fish in the world with shiso leaf and plum sauce, and the odd, but very real, potato salad. Yes. It was awesome. I immediately forgot about the seating issue and fell in love with Itto. Itto Sushi has become my favorite sushi place in Chicago.

From the moment we walked into the restaurant, it was like a scene from Lost In Translation sans Bill Murray. I could not understand a word of what the host was saying to us. I also noticed that my friend and I were the only two non-Japanese patrons in the restaurant.  The service was painstakingly slow and I was starving which did not make the situation any better. It took a long time for our food to come and then even longer for the bill to come. I mean, honestly, how long does it take to make Sashmi - isn't it just raw fish!? However, they do deserve two stars. One star is for their menu which had so many options which was nice - over 50 different appetizers. And the food was all in all was pretty good. Also, I figure if real Japanese people are eating at sushi restaurant I find that pretty indicative that the food is up to caliber. The second star for the ""valet"" parking, I hate having to find parking the city so it was nice that the restaurant had a parking lot in the back. However, I felt odd tipping the valet since we walked to the car after dinner and he simply handed me the keys. Come to think of it, I want my two dollars back. Just kidding!  Next time, order from the take out menu! Good food & relatively inexpensive, but the dining experience in the restaurant was a disaster.",0.6083,0.854,0.091,0.055,0.4933165971959076

2009-05-30,4.0,"Itto was recommended to me from a good friend. Having moved from Los Angeles, and eating japanese food probably 3 times a week for the last 5 years, I've become accustomed to a certain quality and essence to Japanese cuisine (aka, I'm a snob. I hate being one. but I am. OK?! sorry! I try to keep it in check, really I do. Because I hate snobs. But I am one.) That said, for a Japanese restaurant in a city not necessarily known for its Japanese restaurants, I'm happy to say Itto has met my standards, and I wish I went more than the once-every-two-months that I do. It's owned, operated, and run by Japanese people, which is somewhat comforting considering so many Sushi places are Korean or Chinese owned.  No offense of course, but it lacks that authenticity any other way.  There are always Japanese customers here, which is also a good sign. It comes as close as I've found to an izakaya in the city, which is also something I've sorely missed.  The problem with Japanese food is that I love so much of it is that I want to order everything off the menu. This place has its share of goofy maki rolls, which at this point, are merely expected at Japanese restaurants, authentic or not.  Regardless, I've been willing to try a few, and as long as they have spicy mayo or tuna on them, i'm pretty stoked.  All the fish I've had has been extremely fresh - nothing tastes freezer burned, fishy, or funky in any way.  The sashimi slices are average-sized  - I've certainly had more generous - but knowing you're getting a good piece of fish is far more important. They have great agadashi tofu and I recommend their bento box style meals - they're filling and quite a bargain that come with Fish or Chicken, Salad, tempura, ice cream, rice, miso soup, and some california rolls. I'd love to come here for lunch some day but alas, I work too far away.  I hope I can ""earn"" a set of chopsticks behind the counter soon.  One gripe: I wish they served Ebisu beer.  Hell, I wish any place in Chicago served it.  They do have free valet though, which is pretty rare.",0.996,0.707,0.212,0.081,0.547594246031746

To end the evening, there were many flavors of mochi.  I went with red bean (my all-time favorite) and blueberry.  Both were delicious.

I've been to Itto few times when I lived in South Bend, feeling desperate to have a good sushi. It was worth the drive. Now after almost a decade and confirming upon Yelp reviews that the place is still great , I suggested my friend to grab a dinner there while visiting Chicago.  Yes, it is still Japanese-owned. Everybody who works there is Japanese. Tonight, there are many Japanese business men sitting at the sushi counter. So, you would think these are good signs for an wonderful sushi experience...... WTF!??   Both Hamachi and Toro were stringy. Ikura was okay. Uni was decent. Hotate was quite good. My friend's spicy tuna rolls had old tasting tuna. Agetashi dofu was pretty good. The servers were quite sweet, friendly and efficient.  There were only like 4 items on the white board (including toro, ironically, along with 2 types of snappers and grouper).  What happened?  Was my standard just low enough to appreciate Itto after living in non-sushi oriented states (IN, MI, LA) for such a long time? Or, was it possibly an off night at Itto?

So I sit at the sushi counter; I check the specials board for what fish are in (and they go global on that; I think they're one of the few places not served by Rev. Moon's sushi-in-a-van empire); I scan the specials menu for cooked guidance. I'll order some nigiri--remember, you came here for the fish, not some mayo and fried shit stuffed together--I'll order something with eggplant, as they do lovely t'ngs with it. They are golden with the fryer and grill, as traditional Japanese restaurants are apt to be; some fatty seabass or yellowtail collar, grilled and choked with lemon, will do nicely, as will tonkatsu.

2009-03-11,3.0,"A Japanese sushi restaurant actually owned by Japanese people?  That has a plethora of Japanese patrons?  This is a rarity in Chicago, and my fiancee and I had to find out how it stood.  (Note, this does not by any means imply that the non-Japanese owned restaurants are lower in quality, but this is definitely the rarity). Appetizers:  Fried Smelt, Seaweed Salad - Seaweed salad was the standard good quality that you can find in most restaurants.  Tasty way to start.  Fried smelt were crispy when the smelt was thing enough, otherwise, left with a somewhat chewy texture.  Not bad, but wouldn't order again. Main course:  Fancy Chirashi, Select Nigiri pieces: For this price, the chirashi was far from filling... granted the fish was fresh and tasty, the size of the bowl, quantity of the fish, and mix of fish was left wanting.  Matsuya does a better job with their chirashi IMHO and a cheaper price point with equivalently fresh fish. We tasted unagi, sake (salmon), and escolar (super white tuna).  These tend to be our staples of nirgiri.  We also ordered up uni to taste test here.  This is truly where Itto shines, as the nigiri was delicious, and fairly affordable across the board.   Main Course, Second:  California Roll, Spicy Tuna, and two others randomly chosen - Honestly, I'd be okay not ordering rolls here again.  I don't believe their rolls are well done, fairly densely packed with rice, and it just wasn't enjoyable.  From the past reviews, my guess is they began adding more rolls to their menu based on customer demand, however the rolls are mediocre at best. Final Verdict:  Excellent place for nigiri.  Honestly, the quality and price point are great, and it's definitely a down to earth no frills sushi place.  If you're looking for the newest fancy rolls, don't come here... if you want good old tradition nigiri served fresh, tasty, and affordable, this is a staple.  Fiancee and I will be coming back for sure.

2009-03-05,3.0,"I've had sushi on the brain the last few days and it's all Michael G's fault!  I heard good things about Itto and have been wanting to try it for a while now since I prefer simple, traditional rolls. I ordered 3 maki: spicy tuna, sake kyu, and negimaguro, which I got for just under $15. The spicy tuna was my favorite of my 3 rolls. Generous portions of fish and whole pieces; it was definitely the most flavorful of the 3 rolls I got. My least favorite roll was the sake kyu (salmon and cucumber), compared to my other 2 rolls it was light on the fish, heavy on the rice. The sake kyu wasn't bad, just not as good as the others and salmon rolls are usually my favorite.  I love ginger with my maki and asked for extra since I rarely have enough for my meal, but the ginger I got with my rolls was *raggedy* looking. It hadn't gone bad, there were just a lot of small slivers of ginger rather than the nice sized pieces you usually get; the slivers ended up sinking to the bottom of my soy sauce because they wouldn't stay on the roll. Even though I carried out, service was very friendly and no one made me feel like a cow for the amount of sushi I ordered. I know I have a bit of a sushi problem, but backhanded compliments like *wow, that's a lot of sushi for just one person* or *that's enough to feed two people* are never appreciated. So kudos to Itto for that! Bottom line: 3.5 stars. The fish was fresh, the rolls were good, I would definitely give it another shot. TIP: Here's a tip so you don't look foolish like I did, you can thank me later. When you get to the entrance you will see a stairwell going up and a wood, windowless door next to it. That windowless door looks like it would lead to someone's apartment, but it does not, it leads you right into Itto.

It's refreshing to hear a 'irasshaimase!' when walking into a sushi restaurant in Chicago, since the majority of Chicago sushi places aren't run by Japanese. They have a separate menu in Japanese, which should tell you something. I only wish my Japanese reading skills were better so that I could feel confident ordering from it (someday soon!)  Delivery is also excellent. They pack their sushi in a separate bag from hot food (unlike places like Kamehachi), and the people on the phone and the delivery drivers are very pleasant.  Sushi is good and reasonably priced. The rice has the perfect consistency, the fish tastes fresh, and they give you plenty of gari and wasabi (it was freshly made and super hot- not out of a tube, but not hon wasabi- which I will ask about the next time I'm in). I have not tried their uni yet, but will report back when I do- since it's a favorite of mine. We also ordered tempura udon and beef soba (for the boyfriend). They arrived well-packaged (the tempura separate) and piping hot. The tempura veggies were delicious and perfectly battered. Boyfriend liked his beef soba a lot, and he's not too accustomed to Japanese cuisine (yet).  Whoever described this as Japanese comfort food was totally right.

I also drank this really cool soda that had a marble in it.  The fried eel was really good along with this really lightly battered fried chicken. The main dish, which was beef teriyaki, was phenomenal. I really enjoyed the flavor they put in the meat and the sauce. For desert I had this weird ice cream dish that was rice on the outside (although you can't tell) and green tea ice cream on the inside. It was really tasty.  They also threw in a free green tea pudding that was amazing. Overall it was great and fairly priced. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a small low key place to eat Japanese food.  Oh! Also! They have their own parking so that's a HUGE plus",0.9949,0.729,0.249,0.022,0.5340245775729647

My friends ordered SO much food... and a lot of it was not the typical ""American"" Japanese like sushi rolls and sashimi, but instead was other traditional foods like fried smelt, raw squid, something that tasted like pate, filefish, etc. Yes, we ate a lot and a lot of the stuff even I have never tried!  The people were so nice, at least I think they were nice, as I don't understand Japanese and they were basically talking to my Japanese friends the whole night.

I'm not necessarily one of those people that looks at the racial composition of the staff and then judges how things will taste or what-not.

Since my date really loves this place, I was really hoping for something amazing... but ultimately, it just wasn't. Now this could have been a fluke, or off-night... I will concede that point for sure... but I always test an establishment's sushi by ordering two things, ""Unagi Nigiri"" and ""Sake Nigiri"" - I always find that a place that can prepare these two well pieces well, nearly always gets high marks in my book. The Sake Nigiri's texture felt like it wasn't all that fresh... you know that slightly rubbery texture that sets in to slightly aged fish-based sushi? Their miso soup was very good and so were their gyoza... but it is my opinion that it is kind of hard to screw those ones up. Anyhow, despite that lack of an impressive food experience... I really had a great time that night, but it was because the woman I was on the date with is so amazing and engaging.

2008-01-20,3.0,"Solid, but doesn't live up to the hype on Yelp. As a Japanese restaurant, serving home-style Japanese cuisine, Itto is pretty good (for Chicago).  These comprise dishes beyond the familiar trio (sushi, udon and teriyaki), and they tend to be less salty, sweet or provocative; traditional Japanese is rather simple and 'bland' to the taste buds used to the sickly sweet teriyaki sauces and the sharp wasabi stings.  I personally don't prefer the authentic Japanese cuisine, but I think that Itto does them well -- if you crave home-style cooking, Itto should be among the top in your list.  On the other hand, if you're craving sushi, Itto doesn't really stand out among its peers.  Fish is fresh, but so are other four-Yelp-stars establishment.  The sushi and rolls are consistenly well made with the right proportions, but others do the same.  Itto starts to fall behind in the 'innovation' department, because it sticks with the traditional, perhaps dabbling with an asparagus in a roll here and there, while others are churning out some spectacular hits (and misses).  To me, Itto sushi is good, but boring; it is not my destination for sushi. Service is no-nonsense and friendly, and they'll be happy to accomodate your questions and requests; chum up to them, and they will do the same.  It's fairly down-to-earth and casual, but still Japanese in its manners -- i's a good thing.  Atmosphere wise, it has the usual Japanese restaurant decor, with frayed edges and age obviously showing. This is not a place I'll bring my out-of-town friends to wow them with sushi; it's more of a place where I'll go with a buddy or two, order a few appetizers and enjoy an evening of conversation and sake.",0.9967,0.785,0.206,0.009,0.5002070393374741

Downside is that the environment is not very romantic nor chic.  In fact, it feels like a very odd set-up, kind of like if you took a horseshoe shaped Denny's and dropped a Japanese restaurant into it.  But I guess that's how they are able to get away with good food at reasonable prices.",0.9796,0.783,0.17,0.047,0.5165750915750915

Slow service and bland dishes made this a rather substandard meal, although I do agree that everyone was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice and cozy. Perhaps we got off to a poor start. Our appetizers took a really, really long time to get to us, and we saw tables around us getting through multiple dishes before ours finally came. The gyoza fell apart and the soft shell crab was no longer recognizable after being so deeply fried. Now I love a good crunch but this almost defeated the purpose of ordering the soft shell. Since it was cold that night, I opted for the beef udon while my boyfriend had the tempura udon along with the matsu sushi. My udon was extremely bland and the beef, although thin, wasn't especially tender. I've had better. My boyfriend's udon was much more flavorful and this time I liked the crunchy tempura (at some places it gets soggy so fast and who likes that?).

We had to wait a long time for a seat, but that was ok, we kind of arrived at the prime dining time.   When we finally got seated, we got 3 menus - the drink menu, the specials of the day, and the regular menu.  We decided that we should give at least one of the specials a try, and the Grilled Cold Eggplant with ginger sounded yummy.  We were in the mood for something deep-fried (how can anything deep-fried not be good??), so we went with the shrimp and vegetable tempura.  Then for our sushi, we got a LOT.  I got the Dragon maki, the tuna avo-maki, and the una-maki (I think those were the names).  My friend got the California, the Philadelphia, and the Tempura makis.   The tempura was yummy, but again, hello, deep fried???  Then the eggplant came out...  We were definitely scared for awhile - the eggplant was cold yes, but tasted like it was overboiled - and then, there was absolutely NO flavor.  They litterally just put a pinch of grated fresh ginger in the middle.  Eww.  I tried to eat it, I really did.  It was not good.  My friend spit it out.   Then...  The heavenly sushi came out.  This sushi was sooo good.  Very fresh and good quality.  My friend chowed down on her 3 rolls in no time.  I still had some leftover, all the more to enjoy today.  The sushi gets 4.5 stars from us!  We will definitely be back.",0.9905,0.746,0.186,0.067,0.5267744332961725

The friendly waitresses brought extra appetizers and didn't look disgusted when I horribly mispronounced the dishes. The fish is very fresh here, and wonderfully tasty. I thought that maybe there could have been more creative maki rolls, but I'm probably used to Americanized sushi- there were plenty of Japanese people eating here, so it must be authentic.

We tried a number of expensive, way too fancy places and I was starting to resign myself to the fact that we'd have to hop on a Clark St. bus back to Tokyo Marina every time the sushi-craving hit when we found Itto Sushi.

2006-09-26,5.0,"It's difficult to add to the bevy of accolades that Itto has already received.  However, I must share with you all an oh-so-pleasant surprise I encountered last night at dinner.  I'll sum it up in five words: Fried skatewing -- so damn good! Authentically Japanese?  No way.  Ridiculously delicious?  You betcha!   My gf and I saw this little treat on Itto's specials menu and since we're both fans of skatewing in general (we've only had it at French and Italian restaurants), we decided to give it a whirl.  When the dish came out, it was difficult to decipher that it was actually skatewing -- it just looked like a big hunk of fried stuff.  But upon taking a bite of it, I knew we had struck gold.   The meat was soft and flaky, almost crab-like, which is a very good thing in my book.  The fried exterior had a good crunch and lots of flavor.  The skatewing also came with a dipping sauce, which provided a nice tart contrast to the fish.  The dish was so tasty that by the end, I was seriously eating it with my hands as if it was a piece of fried chicken.  I was THIS close to sucking all the meat off of the bones before I remembered that we were eating in public and not at home.  Oh and the best part?  The dish only costs $7.50!  Do you know how ridiculous that is?  $7.50 will barely get me a side of asparagus at some restaurants.   Get it while the getting is good because who knows how much longer it'll be on their specials menu.  You won't regret it!",0.9627,0.81,0.125,0.065,0.5184615384615383
