Fries come with the dog or Polish, and are wrapped in wax paper with your sausage.  They're the crinkle cut variety and the quality varies.  Sometimes they'll be extra crisp, other days they'll be a bit limp and soggy.

2008-09-18,3.0,"This is the hot dog stand I mentioned in my first review of the Map Room. I did not know its name until Wednesday. (This is understandable. Any venue named ""Sam's"" could be in the scope of the big-budget bullies from Arkansas, which thinks it has a copyright on the name.) (I also think the address is wrong. I believe it is actually 2345 W. I will communicate with Yelp administration.) This time, I had the polish. Sam's uses Vienna Beef for *all* of its sausages, including the polish. The Vienna polish is average. In my vista, a polish should not merely be a larger size (this was an eight). It should have some spicing in it (cumin?). But the sausage itself is well-cooked. It is chewy without being too taut.  I tend to agree with our Yelper who opined that the crinkle-cut french fries are Ore-Ida [a store brand]. You will not eat all of them, regardless of whether you like them soft or crunchy. They're that variable. I would give Sam's a 3 1/2-star rating if I could because it is a good, filling base at a reasonable price for your imminent beer consumption at the Map Room. Re: ""Outdoor Seating"": It is *all* outdoors, but there is no seating. Transit options: You're within staggering distance from the Blue Line ""L"" Western station. The #49 Western bus also runs all the time. The #56 Milwaukee bus runs northbound until 1:54 am. The #X49 runs weekday daylight hours. The #73 Armitage bus runs until 10:00 pm.",-0.1027,0.958,0.022,0.02,0.40952380952380946
2008-08-07,3.0,What can you really say about a hot dog stand? Not too much. Hot dogs - mmm. Fries - mmmm. Grease late at night - mmmm. What is special: I always seem to witness drug deals on the sidewalk behind the place. Not surprising for that Armitage/Western/Milwaukee area (if anyone remembers what it used to resemble).

The hot dogs are OK but  not great and while they give you a plethora of fries, they aren't that good either. I prefer George's.",0.8844,0.747,0.202,0.051,0.6583333333333333

As one other yelper said, it is not the cleanist place, the do not where gloves, it just looks kind of dirty.  BUT I've been going to Sams for years and have never had a negative expierance.

2007-04-04,4.0,"While these aren't classic Chicago dogs (no poppy seed bun, tomato wedges, or pickle), they are mighty tasty and cheap. You can get your dog with or without peppers (which if you go the pepper route be warned that they're pretty spicy). And along with the $2.15 price for the dog, you get a large order of crinkle french fries that taste just like Ore-Ida (probably are).  Since Sam's is only a couple blocks from my apartment, they are often an inexpensive solution for dinner. In fact, I had them tonight! I will agree with the one reviewer that questioned the cleanliness of this establishment. I don't dwell on it and just enjoy my dog. And I have had plenty of them and have never gotten sick. An added bonus about this hot dog stand is that the people who work here are generally very friendly and always super fast!",0.9723,0.791,0.168,0.041,0.63992673992674
2007-01-16,5.0,"Finally someone took the time to put this place on Yelp.  Thanks, Nicole R. Sam's is a Bucktown institution, having been in the same spot for 25 years.  But for Gene and Jude's in River Grove, Sam's probably has the best dog in Chicago.  I don't like the ""Chicago Style"" dogs as much as I just like a good all beef hot dog, boiled right with a steamed bun, mustard, relish, and peppers.  That's what you get at Sam's.  It's a solid, solid dog.  Also, I don't even like fries, but I eat Sam's fries. Sam's is the perfect example of ""simple done right"".  If you're near there, I recommend grabbing a dog.  Beats the Wiener Circle hands down.",0.9142,0.818,0.144,0.039,0.43949735449735444

2007-01-02,4.0,"I agree with Nicole!  This hot dog stand recalls days long gone in Chicago, a day where any city dweller out for a stroll could partake in delicious red hots by merely walking up to a stand. These hot dogs and Polish sausages are some of the best, greasiest, tastiest, and most authentic I've had in the city.  They're made exactly how they should be served here in Chi-town: onions, relish, hot peppers, tomatoes, and no ketchup!  They come with an abundance of fries for only $2.25 (dog) or $2.50 (sausage). Courteous staff and delicious eats make this place an awesome place to walk to for a delicious (fattening) dinner.",0.9773,0.766,0.216,0.018,0.703125
2006-12-27,5.0,"I can't believe no one's rated this place yet!  I can't even find a phone number for it. Sam's is on the corner of Milwaukee, Armitage, and Western, and is a little shack of a place with a sliding window for service.  It's run by two cool older ladies who really look after you--they gave me advice regarding the fry order size and didn't try to upsell me, they gave me a tamale from the fridge when they didn't have enough warm ones ready, put it in a separate bag and told me how to microwave it when I got home, and told me to look out when this sketchy homeless crackhead guy was hovering around me and I wasn't paying attention.  I really felt like they cared, which is so rare in the service industry nowadays. As for the hot dogs--they are, hands down, the best I've had in Chicago, full of flavor and done up just the right way.  The fries are great and keep well on the walk home--plus they give you a boatload with each hot dog for the low price of something like $2.25.  The tamales are good for the premade kind, and the pizza puffs are the best ever, flaky and tasty.  It's even open pretty late, 12:30 on the weekends (not sure about weekdays). This is the quintessential Chicago hot dog stand.  I can't recommend it more highly.",0.9884,0.807,0.17,0.023,0.5531009070294785
