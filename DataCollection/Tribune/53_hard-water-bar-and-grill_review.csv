2016-07-23,1.0,"0 stars. I would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. From the minute we walked in the service was awful. We ordered an appetizer & two dinners. The appetizer and meal came out at the same time. Which isn't supposed to be the case. Our table was faulty and rocky which caused a water to spill on my friends food when we told the waitress she said she would make new food for her but never came back. We got up to leave and she said she would put it in to go boxes and we need to pay our bill. Guess what food they put in the to go box? Yep the soggy burger.  They take out a 20% tip automatically but don't tell you until you see your bill. So even though the service was horrible, we didn't eat our food, and they gave us a soggy burger, we still were forced to pay a tip.  THIS IS THE WORSR SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD.",-0.8374,0.86,0.041,0.099,0.4632575757575758

2016-06-14,3.0,"I visited this place twice, once late at night for some drinks and fun and the second time for dinner.  Well, I must say that the first time around was great; long island was strong, music the DJ was playing was on the spot (some oldies which was nice), people were dancing, playing pool and just a great atmosphere overall. I'd say this is a good place to just kick it. Now as far as the food goes... We ordered chicken wings for appetizers, these were the smallest chicken wings I have ever seen, probably from like a Cornish hen or something, we didn't want those so we ordered the nachos, eh, chips were stale, $2 extra for chicken on the nachos and hardly got any chicken, didn't finish those either. I ordered the cheeseburglar. When it came, the bottom of the pretzel bun was so burnt, it was hard and just inedible and the burger patty itself was clearly overcooked as it was clearly a frozen patty, I asked for pink in the middle, but I did not get it that way, greasy. The only decent thing on that plate was the onion straws.  Our server was very friendly and I felt bad for all the apologizing she did for the terrible food. I think that is the chef's job.  I will definitely be back for the late night ambiance but definitely not the food. That needs a great deal of improvement.

To start - the place was dead.  There were a ton of employees (we saw at least 7 people who appeared to work there) and one guest.  We asked upon reaching the hostess stand for a table outside, and she immediately started leading us to the right away from the door to the beer garden area.  Ok, maybe she didn't hear us.        So we re-asked and were told to go outside and choose a table.  Of which there were many bc there wasn't a soul out there.  Nor were there any clean tables.  They all were covered in slightly dirty table cloths.  Only one television still hung on the wall.  The tent flaps were shut despite the fact it was 75 degrees outside.  Two televisions sat on a few tables stacked in the corner, and a couple of garbage bins sat in another corner.  Old streamers from what seemed to be a long forgotten birthday party hung from the wall and pieces of the same streamers hung from the door.  It was mildly depressing to say the least.        We chose a table in the corner, and continued to try to give this spot a decent chance.  The menus were handed to us - which were also slightly dirty - and they did not contain any of the witty names from the website menu...and were also much shorter than the website menu.  Ok, ok...the website does say items are subject to change, so....      Our hostess-now-waitress asked if we would like a drink. I ordered a coke, and my husband ordered a beer.  A few minutes later a glass of water and a beer were delivered to our table.  Oh vey....We decided at that point that we really no longer wished to eat a full meal here - partly due to cleanliness, partly due to service thus far, and partly due to the fact that the menu presented to us did not really hold our attention the way their online version did.  So we ordered a quick appetizer since we were there (and I'm real bad at any confrontation, including pointing out that I had indeed ordered something other than a water).  We were the only patrons, and the fried snack we ordered took about 20 minutes to appear - and when it did, along with two sets of silverwear, I unwrapped my napkin to find I was only given a steak knife.  To eat fried macaroni and cheese balls.  Seriously?      When the check was delivered to our table, the waitress actually apologized to us for the poor service.  Which was nice, but not enough to actually make up for it.  If they had been busy, I would have understood.  But there were people wandering around literally appearing as though they were searching for work to do.  It was quite the scene.     All in all, it is depressing that we no longer have a good hamburger joint in the neighborhood, and that there is a great location here but it is just being wasted.  I do NOT recommend wasting your time.  Go a little further up to Evanston or down to Andersonville - many other choices, which have to be better than this.",-0.948,0.874,0.051,0.076,0.48864258347016976

After a few minutes, the waitress dropped off two menus (literally dropped in front of us) and asked what we wanted to drink... I asked what was on tap and she went and got a crinkled up paper drink menu and said she'd be back. Ten minutes later, who I assume was the manager came by and asked if we'd ordered yet. No. Ok, so she took our order. Strike one. A few minutes later the original waitress asked if we'd ordered yet and made a comment about how she couldn't remember, oh so funny. Not funny. Strike two. The manager again brought out our food and checked up with us after that. The food itself was OK... I wasn't blown away but we had two burgers and they were decent.  Oh, look, now we're done eating and enjoying the game and who starts coming by every couple of minutes like a vulture? The original waitress. Who couldn't be bothered to actually do any serving or waiting but now wants to make my date and I extremely uncomfortable and rushed. I spent $40 for two beers and two unremarkable burgers. Including a very underserved tip that was NOT meant for Crystal, the name on the ticket, who I assume was our horrible excuse for a waitress.  So yeah, we planned on moving to the bar and watching the rest of the game and buying more to drink but since Crystal was so set on rushing us out we decided to go somewhere else where our business would be appreciated. Right after I signed the bill and set the book down next to me, not on the end of the table, but in front of me, she rushed on over to grab it before I even had time to put my card away... Horrible horrible service. I really wanted to like this place and was hoping to start bringing my weekly trivia group here.

2015-05-06,1.0,"Over the weekend my wife and I had one of our rare moments when we decided we wanted burgers.  When you don't eat burgers often, you don't just want McDonalds, you want something of quality.  So, I went to the website and saw the one burger option was their ""Cheeseburgular"" (Yes, I'm spelling the right.  Worst name ever.  A name that would imply that it's a regular cheeseburger, but I'll get to that in a moment.)  I decided to call to order for pick-up.  ""Uh, where's the phone number on the website?"" I asked.  It's nowhere to be found.  I had to Google it and get it off Yelp.  Then, the kid who answered the phone acted as if he was unfamiliar with the concept of ordering food from a restaurant.  I told him I wanted ""two cheeseburgers"" when he stopped me and said, ""Wait, do you mean our Cheeseburgulars?""  (That's right, Stephen Hawking.  How clever of you to connect the dots.)  Then he said, ""Okay, thanks,""  and started to hang up.  I said, ""Wait, don't you need my name?"", and his reply was, ""Uh, oh, yeah, I do need that.""  ""How long will this take?"" I said.  ""It definitely won't take any longer than 15 to 20 minutes.""  So, 20 minutes later I showed up, and he immediately knew who I was.  Then I sat down for another twenty minutes before my food came out.  Forty minutes is a big difference from 15.  I'd like to tell you all this was worth it, but I really have no idea what the burgers tasted like.  Why?  Because they were so slathered with bad cheese and sauce that there was no tasting the actual meat.  Like a former reviewer, I really wanted this place to be good, but I won't be coming back anytime soon.  I will say that we once went there for a very good brunch.  I mean it was really great, but from what I understand they don't even serve brunch anymore.  Very disappointing, but hoping whatever goes in there next will take note of these bad reviews, so they know what to avoid.",0.924,0.806,0.112,0.082,0.43638954299668586
2015-05-05,1.0,"If I could give this place zero stars, I most absolutely would. I had the misfortune of visiting this establishment more than a few times back when it was Hophaus. Even then, the food was good, but the service was always terrible. Servers were all the same. Slow, unattentive, and rude.   Fast forward to 2015, and it is now the Hardwater Cafe. I will try my hardest to keep this review short, because this crap hole isn't even worth more than the words that I am typing now. This past Saturday afternoon around 1:15, my friend and I were literally ""HANGRY"". We walk in, and considering how big this place is, there was no one at the bar, and three tables occupied with groups of no more than 2-3 people. The bartender told us to sit down at any table we like, and a server will be with us. Now mind you, this place is dead, as it's 1 in the afternoon. We sit down, and over TEN MINUTES LATER a young man comes up frantically, as if preparing for the apocalypse, hands us two menus, and then swiftly turns to his left to go to the server table to get us a drink menu. He then places the drink menu on the table and says, ""Oh, and let me present you with a drink menu"". Not a second later, he runs off. Literally, HE RAN OFF. I quickly turn and say, ""Umm, can we???"" But it was too late, he was gone. I guess we needed more than ten minutes to decide what we wanted to drink, let alone order food! After another 3 minutes or so, we just got up and left. My friend and I both knew at that point, this was going to be a cluster you know what. With our past bad experiences with this place, and since we were so hungry, we weren't even going to take a chance with the joker of a server we had. The bartender that initially told us to get our own table, watched us walk out with a smirk on his face, and didn't say one word, nor did he even ask us what was wrong. Great customer service!

While both male/female bouncers and my date found some humor in my statement, the mood quickly changed when we were allowed inside without my date being searched. Bless his heart, he flipped out more than I did (""So you're really going to frisk just her and not me? Really? Are you...seriously?""), and was then also frisked. And we also turned around and left. It's not the principle of being searched that's the issue. It''s that this place is evidently now attracting a crowd which led the restaurant to have to complete searches prior to entry to ensure patron safety.  And the restaurant's hired hands lazily used typical profiling standards to guard the fort. I wasn't even going to post about this event (happened in March), but given that I've read several other online reviews where customers mentioned that non-white patrons were searched and white ones weren't?  Hard Water has got to get their security together and tell them to cut this nonsense out. I don't care if myself and the others were outliers, no customer should ever have this complaint. Frisk everyone or frisk no one.  Let's play Devil's Advocate for a second. Maybe I had a thuggish, rogue-ish appearance (as if that's a justification), and I looked like ""one of those people"" who would stick a gun-toting midget in her purse. My date had spent the day enjoying golf at his club, and was wearing khaki pants/polo/loafers. I spent my day at the office/brunch/shopping, and was wearing a skirt/blouse/nylons/pumps. Yes. The interracial preppy couple is coming. There goes the neighborhood!  Was I searched because my Balenciaga purse was last season? Which, ironically, wasn't even opened and reviewed. Again, Lil' Rambo may be up in there--and he's pissy when he doesn't have his gin martinis.  But in all seriousness, frisk everyone or frisk no one. My assumption is that the security is either only used for large parties (which seemed to be the case when I last visited), or is a constant after certain service hours.  Given that I have met and spoken with Hard Water's management and staff on several occasions, I know that they are not only absolutely congenial but absolutely professional and absolutely awesome people all-around.

Go next door for good food, service  and entertainment.  This place is a joke.",0.5514,0.855,0.067,0.078,0.3947530864197531

2015-02-03,2.0,"I have been a patron of this restaurant since the Hop Haus days. Man....I miss Hop Haus.... Anywho. I frequently come here with colleagues because it's conveniently located, parking is free, and they have a decent beer selection. I truly hope my next experience here will be a bit more positive and that what we experienced was simply opening jitters: - The heat was not on. It was snowing outside and the heat wasn't on. Apparently, someone had turned off the heat the day before, and the place takes forever to warm back up. The staff were all walking around with their coats on (I felt so bad) and overall, it was a chilly environment for a snowy evening. - They advertised $2 drafts, but upon reviewing the menu it was actually $2 PBR or Miller Lite. No big deal...I ordered a PBR... They were out of PBR. I will say they were kind enough to extend the $2 rate to the beer I did eventually order. - They also advertised half appetizers. Despite the fact their Mac and Cheese is listed UNDER Starters, this discount did not apply. Like I said, I am willing to chalk this up to a bumpy beginning - I will probably go back for the reasons aforementioned.  But man... I miss the Hop Haus.",0.7865,0.882,0.077,0.04,0.3979390175042348

2015-01-24,4.0,"My wife and I went here for a drink and dinner recently, and we both really liked it. We had wings, burgers, and the donut stick things. First the wings, man were they good! We didn't expect them to be quite as good as they were. They were crispy, not soggy like some wings get, hot, and delicious. I saw they have a 50 cent wing night on Wednesday. I've been looking for a new wing Wednesday location, and I think I found it! The burgers were good though extremely messy to eat. Not a big deal, that's why the napkin was invented! I had the hard water burger (bacon cheeseburger), and though I wouldn't say it was my all time favorite burger, it was darn good, and I'll definitely be ordering it again. The dessert, I honestly don't remember it's name, donut something with a nutela dipping sauce was outstanding. It almost taster like funnel cake sticks. Sooo good, no complaints on the food! I docked one star because the service was a little slow. The place wasn't packed, but the waitress seemed to be a little swamped. She never returned for drink orders, we ordered food first because we wanted to check out the beer menu, which is pretty good (Lots of Lagunitas and great specials). When we first arrived nobody was there to seat us or tell us to sit down. I'm guessing this is just an off day, or at least I hope so because the drinks and food are great! That said, the employees were all incredibly nice and seemed happy to be there, which does make it more enjoyable to be there. Normally I don't compare restaurants that replace an old one at a location, but I do want to mention that unlike when Hop Haus became Roland's, and was pretty much the same mediocre menu and terrible service, this place is completely different. The staff is super nice and the food is much better than that one, so don't fear a third face lift of the same place, this is a whole new restaurant.  I'm looking forward to doing some wing Wednesdays and watching some baseball/football games there. TVs are everywhere. Definitely recommend this place!  BTW, I used the $16 for $30 groupon to try this place out. If you're on the fence give it a shot.

When it came to our table, it was lukewarm, on the verge of being cold, but we were so hungry that it wasn't worth the complaint and time for them to fix an entire new order. I had a burger for my entree which was much better than the dip but nothing worth going back for. Also, we had dirty plates on our table for a while after we had received new food.

I had actually called ahead to give them a notice of our plans, but had no idea how many people were planning on showing up till a couple hours prior to the game.  There was a great special on miller lite, well drinks, and 1/2 price appetizers on Monday, that we took advantage of, and they even let our group use a Groupon that is currently available.  We had a great time as a group and felt well taken care of by the staff, who appeared to be sharing responsibilities in delivering our food and beverages.  The wings were noteworthy. We tried the bbq, the habanero chipotle and the sweet Thai chili. All were good! I don't think anyone used the ranch dipping sauces.  The buffer sandwich (buffalo chicken), which I had, was amazing. I really want to go back and have it again. Right now. It had the best grilled onions on it, which is weird, but gooood. I also substituted the ciabatta bun for a pretzel roll since all the guys who ordered burgers had that bun. I didn't taste one, but the burgers looked great (huge and delicious). I'll definitely try one some time. The fries were good, too, sort of standard and not meant to be the stars of the show.  Another guy tried the mac n cheese balls, and he said they were great. I believe him, since he didn't share and didn't take his time eating them.  There are TV's all over the place in this bar, and it should be a go to for catching the game.  They could improve on the onion straws, not my favorite and the chicken fingers, we're sort of disappointing compared to the rest of the food. I think they were essentially the exact same ones you get from Jewel. I know they could do better there.  Lastly, I think the service was good but there were some times when I felt it could have been even better. It took a while to get things or drinks refilled some of the game and other times, they were very attentive.  Four stars for good wings and sandwiches and accommodating our group on the fly.

2014-11-13,2.0,"Curiosity (and a Groupon) sometimes prompts my bride and myself to check out a new place ... or perhaps the third in a series of restaurant/sports-bars at this location.  Other reviewers [including myself] have reviewed the prior occupants, but I'm giong to try and approach Hard Water as if it were our first time through the door. Walking through the door, I got a sense of the atmosphere of the place.  Unfortunately, the atmosphere was that of Men's Room Urinal Puck -- it wasn't stick-your-head-in-the-urinal strong but it was noticeable throughout the public space.  The hostess greeted us and escorted us to one of the side tables; she put her hand on the table and the table began to tip.  Ummm, okay.  Soon afterwards, our waitress came up with menus and took our drink orders.    She was friendly, knew the menu, and put out a commendable level of energy and professionalism. My wife ordered a plate of nachos and a bowl of chili, and I went for the Hardwater Burger (featuring BBQ sauce, onion strings, bacon and bacon-infused cheddar spread on a burger patty).   The nachos came out first, followed shortly by the chili.  We figured the kitchen thought we were sharing the nachos (which we weren't), which would be a reasonable assumption, so I just sat back, sipped my Lagunitas, and waited for the burger to show up.  Not long afterward, my plate arrived with this nine-inch-tall burger on it.  The first bite was a revelation, and not a good one -- the first impression I got from this burger was a very spicy BBQ sauce backed up with what must have been a radioactively-hot chipotle aioli (which they evidently put on all their burgers, even if they don't mention it on the menu which they didn't in this case).  I honestly couldn't taste cheddar cheese or bacon anywhere in the burger; the BBQ and aioli were so overwhelming.  This is the second restaurant burger I just could not finish.  Meanwhile my wife found that the deeper into the nacho plate she got, the less melted and more shredded the cheese ""sauce"" was -- it was clearly microwaved enough to melt the visible cheese, but that was about it. The scorecard: Atmosphere: I'm sure that clean bathrooms contribute to the overall experience, but a restaurant shouldn't *smell* like a bathroom. Menu: pretty limited for a place this size; the burger menu could be described as ""how much can a poor pretzel roll stand?"". Service: the hostess was friendly (even when faced with an unstable table) and our waitress was totally on the ball.  Knew the menu, kept tabs on our progress, and made sure we had what we needed. Drink: Probably the high point of a visit here.  Good selection of draft beers (Lagunitas -- yay!) and bottled domestics and craft beers.  Full bar can probaby make you most common mixed drinks.  Most of the customers were clustered around the bar. Food: Disappointing.  Finding un-melted cheese shreds in the depths of the nacho plate suggested a finishing in the microwave.  Can't comment on the chili except that my wife liked it.  My burger was just an explosion of flavor, in the sense of putting a lit firecracker in your mouth.  I enjoyed the tater tots more than the burger. Bottom Line: I wanted to enjoy my meal here, but the kitchen seemed to be cutting some corners and the chef's approach to gourmet burgers seems to be to pile on the gimmicks on a poor unsuspecting beef patty -- I'd rather have a plain burger done *right* than the bbq-jalapeno-onion-bacon mess I got here.  I just can't get into this kind of bar food, so two stars and a ""see ya"" seems to be the appropriate rating.",0.9873,0.841,0.104,0.056,0.48391293891293885

Insanely slow service, mostly terrible food, bad hygiene.  Agree with other reviewers, if they stuck to TV and pizza it actually might be a working formula for staying here. Longer version: Went here the second weekend it was open on a very quiet Saturday afternoon before a NW game for its convenient location near the El and nice parking options.

I saw the only other seated people send their burgers back twice and had a bad feeling (especially when the manager came over to apologize to us before we'd even ordered and then realized she had the table wrong). The four of us ordered food and it took a ridiculously long time to get to us, 35 mins for 3 bugers and a thin crust pizza. It arrived and I had a majorly overdone tiny burger on a hugely oversized bun and fries just coated in cornstarch, presumably to make them crispy, but the taste was awful. The burgers on the menu were interesting, but no option to ""create your own"" was given. Then I took a trip to the ladies room and saw that all the toilets were clogged, yum. Waters were never refilled as we watched the other servers sitting in the open and eating the food that the other table sent back (that's fine, just do it in the back dummies!).

2014-10-18,2.0,"They should just remove the ""& Grill"" and this place would rock!  Lot's of tv's and a fully stocked bar with competent bartenders make this a great place to watch the big game or have a late night cocktail but their kitchen is clearly way over their head.  And it's bar food.  The staff was very nice but inexperienced.  I really wanted to like this place.  They seemed like such nice people that I gave them two stars instead of one.  My advice is for Hardwater is to pare down the menu to 10 items or less with a focus on burgers or pizza, so they can deliver food to the tables in a reasonable amount of time.   Maybe something like changing the name to ""Hardwater Pizza and Pub"" and only serve drinks, pizza & salads; they'll be in business a long time.  Otherwise I'm afraid they won't be there in less than a year.",0.9811,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5290123456790123
