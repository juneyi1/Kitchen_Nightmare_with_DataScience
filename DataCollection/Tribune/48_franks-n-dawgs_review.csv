2016-06-12,1.0,"This was the worst/ most bizarre food experience of my life. We arrived and there was maybe 6 people in the entirwho all already got their food. So my wife and I ordered two sausages and cheese fries. Keep in mind this was all they had to cook. Well, 30 min later and we still had no food. Are they hand making the sausages themselves? We finally got our food about 35 min into the order, and one of them was the wrong order. And the cheese fries? French fries with cold, unmelted cheese on top. We went to throw our trash out, and there wasn't a garbage can in the place. And when we were still eating, they decided to shut down an hour early.

2016-05-29,1.0,"Went there for lunch last week. The food used to be better. They used to have a Crab or Lobster dog that was good. That is gone from the menu.  First be aware that the ""hot dogs"" are big sausages, so eating two is too much food.  I don't remember what hot dogs we got because none were memorable. Too bad because the descriptions sounded amazing! The truffle fries were too salty. Just a hint of truffle flavor and a pinch of salt would be fine, but these were way to salty.  We sat in the back patio. As soon as we sat down, a guy at the table next to us asked if it normally took 1 hour to get food, uh oh. It took 30 minutes to get thee hot dogs and a truffle mac and cheese. And then the added bonus of hearing and feeling the front door slam shut ever few minutes.   It was the second time in a couple of months that the food was way below what it used to be a few years ago.  New owners?  Slowly going out of business?  One star for ok service. Nothing to be excited about, but he was working hard.  Not going back. Just too much of a let down to give them $$$$ again.  I guess the Gourmet Hot Dog fad has moved on. Let's work on getting rid of two more annoying fads - Man Buns and the Urban Lumberjack, complete with beard and flannel shirt.",0.8158,0.873,0.084,0.043,0.4291369578134284

2016-04-27,3.0,"***Franks 'N' Dawgs utilizes regional and international influences and techniques to create upscale versions of the humble hot dog; while the ingredients were good, I personally found the food a tad underwhelming and not measuring up to the more simple and focused hot dog eatery The Wiener's Circle*** Franks 'N' Dawgs serves a popular Chicago street food item the hot dog, which is then gussied up with regional or international preparations be it Vietnamese (a banh mi dog) or Southern (a BBQ bacon hot dog).  It is definitely a hard place to settle on a hot dog choice.  Partly because of the wide variety where the flavors range from spicy to sweet, but also because of the many toppings on each hot dog.  With the many toppings, you are bound to like a few on each of their hot dog preparations while simultaneously not being thrilled with some of the topping choices either. Ultimately, I decided on one of their more popular choices, the banh mi hot dog, which it appears has received recognition on television and such.  Their banh mi hot dog consisted of an exceptional hot dog, which was a savory, lightly sweet, faintly spicy, and perfectly juicy lemongrass and coriander chicken sausage.  The hot dog was then topped with everything from pickled boiled egg and carrots to daikon and a creamy Sriracha mayo.  The hot dog sat on a very buttery brioche hot dog bun. While I really enjoyed the chicken sausage (very good quality and nicely cooked), I personally felt there was just too much going on.  I think all the ingredients worked fine by themselves, but when combined together, I felt it was kind of distracting to eat because you have this rich bun, a very flavorful sausage, a creamy and rich aioli and so on.  I also felt there should have been more egg yolk with the inclusion of the boiled egg. I also had their fried cheese curds, which came with a beer mustard dipping sauce.  The fried cheese curds were overly breaded, which took away from the cheese especially since the crispy breading was a tad salty.  The flavor of the cheese was fine, but it did not have that stretchy consistency, which makes cheese curds such a fun novelty to eat.  There was a decent amount of stretchiness but not what you would experience with fried cheese curds in nearby Milwaukee.  I liked the beer mustard sauce. Service was quick and friendly. Prices are not too bad given the generous portions and the quality of the ingredients used. Franks 'N' Dawgs offers some clever hot dog preparations, and I think some of them might be more to my liking than what I experienced on my first visit here.  Overall though, I think Franks 'N' Dawgs is the kind of place where the final product might be a little overworked and a more simple and straightforward approach might yield more impressive results given the quality ingredients used here.  I would not classify it as a must visit for visitors to Chicago, but it is probably worth giving a try if you are a big hot dog fan and live in Chicago. Franks 'N' Dawgs is located in an area where parking is limited.  It is about a 15-minute walk to the nearest CTA station, which is Armitage on the Brown Line.",0.9982,0.821,0.162,0.016,0.6062976190476193

Just because some funky little dive ends up on the Food Network or Travel Channel, trust me, it does not mean its holy than thou or the holy grail of comfort food or whatever. To the contrary, I find it to be more the opposite as a general rule. The Mystery corn dogs were uneatable. They were supposed to be a sampling of sausage/hot dogs. Two were the lamb sausages. No question about it. I know because they were so strong they are unmistakable. That flavor does not belong in a corn dog. And the batter was so heavy that we had to pull it all off. It was like sheet rock. The hot dogs themselves were OK. Very meat or sausage oriented. I understand that many people like that. Not so much for me. They were just over powering. The rest of the interesting toppings got lost in the shadows of the size and flavors of the sausages. The service and people were great. Thank you for that. very friendly. Price was quite reasonable.

First off, the buns were a lot thicker than I'm used to, not in a bad way at all just be prepared for that. The buns were buttered and griddled to make it nice and crispy. Our favorite was the brunch dog by a landslide. Omg it was so good with the egg and the maple aoli  it was exactly like a breakfast dream in my mouth. I definitely would recommend coming back just for that dog alone. The lamb one was pretty good, the giardiniera was a nice acidic balance to the richness of the dog and the bun.

2014-07-14,2.0,"Let me start by saying, my boyfriend and I have been to Franks 'N' Dawgs several times, and we love the food there.  The reason for the low rating is not at all due to the quality of food they serve.  The lack of stars is unfortunately due to almost everything else.  One of the main things that has frustrated us is their hours, or lack thereof.  For a successful restaurant to not be open past the time most people are getting off work, is lunacy to me.  Because of the food and the publicity that they have received from being on multiple food shows, they could capitalize on having longer hours.  I spoke to one of the chefs last time we were there and he said they were very low staffed.  I can understand and sympathize with that, but in this volatile market for restaurants, that will prove to be a vicious cycle and they will lose customers in the long run.  Knowing their crazy schedule already, my boyfriend and I finally made it back here (after several failed attempts due to the previously mentioned schedule) at around 4:45 since there was a ton of traffic in the area.  Thinking they closed at 5 during the week, we were surprised to see on the front door (the one right before you enter, not the gate) that they closed at 7.  We thought we were in the clear and breathed a sigh of relief.  Immediately when we came inside, we noticed that the 2 chefs were working frenetically even though there was no one else in the restaurant.  One of them greeted us, but seemed very exasperated.  While we took a few minutes to weigh our options, that same chef closed the front gate and door behind us.  We asked him about it and he said that the hours on the front door were wrong and they close at 5.  Since we knew they were closing up and we have both worked in the restaurant industry, we ordered a Southerner, the Dawg of the Month (the quiche dawg), and triple truffle fries to go.  The chef said our order would be ready soon.  We ended up waiting quite a while as there was an order ahead of us for people sitting outside.  When one of those people came back in after receiving their order, the chef gave me a look of exasperation, like I would understand his plight.  Then, a woman with 4 little boys including a baby in a carrier came in the exit door (which was apparently not properly closed since there is no handle, but also no sign saying that it's the exit door).  The woman sets down the baby and her other kids at a table and gets them set up so she can order.  Her husband then walks in.  The chef gives me another exasperated look.  The chef went over to them and tells them that the restaurant has closed even though it's only a few minutes after 5 and they had obviously put forth a lot of effort to come there with all those kids.  I could only imagine what those parents were thinking and also realized that they probably would never come back. After the family picked up and left, the chef went over to the exit door and tightly shut it.  He then told us that people will pry open that door even though it doesn't have a handle.  It occurs to me now that he didn't even consider that perhaps it was the lack of proper signage about hours and it being an exit door that caused people to go in that door instead of people being malicious and wanting to make his day longer.  Eventually we got our food and went home to eat.  I noted that when I went through the exit door, I had to make a considerable effort to close the door since it didn't automatically and had no handle to aid me.  We thought the ordeal was over and were prepared for a great meal, one we'd been waiting a while to experience again.  The dawgs were great, but the chefs had majorly skimped us on the fries.  We were splitting them so we each got about 3 fries each...6 fries for $6 is not a good trade-off in my book. My overall view of Franks 'N' Dawgs is great food, but with a staff and schedule which is not customer-focused.  I think people would love to come here as a destination late-night eating spot, I know I would.  Also, a little understanding about what a customer wants once they get in the door wouldn't go unnoticed, whether that be making a to go order for someone who has come a couple minutes after close or the right portion of food.  I was tempted to give them one star for this visit, but gave them 1 additional because the food quality is exceptional.  I hope that the owners see this and think about my suggestions, because if not, who knows how long it will be around.",0.661,0.879,0.06,0.061,0.4024774114774115

They also don't do anything else recognizable as a conventional hotdog. But they do make some interesting gourmet dogs.  We tried three that were somewhat similar: Banh Mi, Tur-Doggin and (the day's special) Quiche Dawg. All were based upon interesting sausages with a number of savory toppings, and all tasted somewhat similar. Interesting, but perhaps not gourmet. We also tried the mystery corn dog platter. To me, the mystery was how anyone could mistake these for corn dogs! There isn't a conventional cornbread coating, just a thing slurry of paste that has been deep fried to a crunchy consistency. There were several different sausages involved; the only clearly identifiable one was lamb. The best dog was actually not a dog, it was the Slammin' Salmon, which was sort of like lox on a bagel but in a bun. Speaking of buns, that's probably the best thing about the place. Rather than conventional hotdog buns, they use squared off chunks of bread that are grilled with butter to a nice golden brown.

We also got a side of the cheese fries and had to restrain ourselves from licking the bowl clean of the cheese sauce. We will definitely be back to tackle the waffle fries and reunite with the Banh Mi sandwich.",0.995,0.661,0.32,0.018,0.5558029689608637
2014-03-30,5.0,Very carefully crafted sausages with a lot of thought into the flavor. It's not just a hot dog by any means. The brunch dog is the classic here. I've been here about 4-5x. Tasted the sampler. They also have a guest chef put together something for the menu which is rotating. Never been disappointed by these guys. If you choose this or hot Doug's you can't go wrong. These are both excellent places to eat with different concepts.,0.6055,0.864,0.098,0.038,0.7645833333333333
2014-03-26,5.0,"4.5 stars. When I reflect on my meal at Franks 'N' Dawgs I will admit that my first thoughts are of the bun. Oh, that bun!! Thick, chewy, carb heaven. I'll never look at another hot dog bun again. Now, if the bun alone is that incredible, just think about what that says about the rest of the dog... These are serious sausages with serious toppings. Every element of my Epic Pig-gasm, from the sweet bacon jam to the crispy chicharrones, was spot on. These dogs not only tapped into my street food cravings, but also provided novel tastes and textures to satisfy the foodie in me. Why choose one if you can have both!? However, I will make one small caveat - and I can't believe I'm even saying this - I almost felt like there was too much bacon. Now, hear me out: I love bacon about as much as it gets, but after my third bite I felt myself searching for more of that fantastic sausage flavor. The toppings, though amazing, did overwhelm a bit. If I return again I'll opt for another dog. If I haven't shocked you all enough with my ""too much bacon"" comment, I'll go out on another limb: I think these fries are overrated. Waffle fries are my all time favorite fry but I found these to be a tad on the soft side. The truffle fries everyone mentions were no better than the ones I've had elsewhere (no worse, either). Truffle fries are everywhere nowadays and Franks 'N' Dawgs is just one other business that offers them. Want to know what you don't see everywhere though? A Franks 'N' Dawgs sausage. As an out-of-towner, I guarantee you that any time I have another sausage, I'll be thinking of Franks 'N' Dawgs...and most likely, wishing I was there again.",0.9899,0.812,0.149,0.039,0.5523809523809524

Do not be afraid of trying a dog because you do not like one of the ingredients. Remember, these guys emphasize their background in fine dining. No single ingredient will overpower the entire dish. Every flavor is complimented and sometimes slightly offset by another.  If it's your first time I recommend you order whatever you are craving that day.

After eating our hot dogs, were still hungry and asked the friendly guy who took our order what he suggested to get on the side, he said their most popular side was the Triple Truffle Fries, but his personal recommendation fried leek rings. Given the quality of the hot dogs, we ordered both.  The triple truffle fries were good, but nothing special, though their popularity suggests this is a minority opinion. The fried leek rings on the other hand were an inspired take on onion rings. Unfortunately, looking at their menu they are sadly no longer available.

Well I gotta tell you it is a damn good thing I had one meal left the following day before I returned to San Fran or there would have been some hell to pay. I've been obsessed with Hot Dougs (never been) but know the have a huge line - AND this was a place I could turn my friend onto that was in her own neighborhood. We were the only ones in the place (they told us later that they are considering a move more downtown to get more traffic). I ordered the bacon sausage with truffle mac and cheese, and my friend got the brunch dog (also bacon sausage with an egg, maple mayo and bacon bits). Let me say right off that this place's buns are off the chain delicious, I mean like crack good, sorta a cross between a brioche and a Hawaiian roll, (east coast style bun) and grilled in butter to be crispy and soft all at the same time.  The bacon sausage was everything it says it is, a bacony sausage - now who can't like that?  The truffle mac and cheese was standard. But it is like that saying that the compilation is more than the sum of its parts. One fine meal.  My friends (I did not get a bite) looked amazing and the quivering egg atop was a thing of beauty -she was covered in yolk, but didn't seem to mind a bit. We had also ordered the poutine, with fois gras (Banned in my home state of CA and I was super excited to sink my teeth in). Sadly, after we ordered and sat down to await our meal, the guy chef came over to say he hadn't prepped the poutine- so they were out. I was pretty sad and he said he'd make something close for us.

Stalking the menu before our adventure, the restaurant promised to ""redefine your sausage experience.""  A friend (who shall remain anonymous *cough cough Anna*) remained unimpressed and opted to stay in Hyde Park. But oh man, did she miss out... Arriving at the restaurant, we were instantaneously greeted by the friendly and jolly staff of the establishment.  Upon placing your order at the front counter, diners get to select a laminated picture of a famous celebrity to mark their table instead of the conventional table number.  My friends and I immediately selected Lindsey Lohan out of the line-up (hehe punny because it is indeed her mugshot) and chose a booth.   The food was served pretty quickly and we began the typical Instagram ritual associated with food that looks delicious and isn't served at the dining hall.  Before ordering my sausage, I asked the workers for suggestions and recommendations.  One guy speedily answered anything.  All doubts I had with his advice quickly vanished at the arrival of our food.  Everything looked and smelled amazing. I got to try two different ""dawgs"" from the menu: the Brunch Dog & the Chilaquiles Dawg.  Both were extremely different but extremely satisfying. The Brunch Dog is a Slagel farms pork loin breakfast sausage with Cobb smoked bacon, fried egg & drizzled with maple mayo.  I love the idea of ""breakfast for dinner"" and this item embodies that idea.  Think breakfast sandwich replaced with an easier to eat alternative.  The maple mayo was eccentric and incredible.  The Chilaquiles Dawg is a Habanero goat sausage, fried egg, queso fresco cheese, tomatillo salsa, red pepper relish, tortilla strips & cilantro.  Labeled as an ""adventurous"" selection by the guy behind the counter, the spice and combination of flavors was spectacular.  Very hard to eat but the juxtaposition of textures found in the toppings provided a crunchy yet juicy layer to the delightful sausage underneath was remarkable. I will definitely be returning to this fine establishment sometime soon and I highly recommend that you venture to Lincoln Park to ""redefine your sausage experience"" as well.  Their wieners are definitely winners.

2013-11-02,1.0,"DO NOT EAT THERE if you are looking for a Chicago hot dog experience. The first thing we learned when one member of our party asked for a Chicago style hot was an abrupt ""we don't sell Chicago style hot dog, read the sign on the lower part of the counter."" This person who reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite acted insulted that we had asked for a Chicago Style hot dog and then proceeded to denigrate the Chicago dog. He described Chicago hot dog as a hot dog with a Greek salad dressing on top of it. Then we learned from this guy that you cannot transfer ingredients from one sandwich to another. They only serve the sandwich exactly how it is described on the menu. The guy explained that in an blunt fashion. There isn't a hot dog joint in this city where you cant get a hot dog like you want it!  Okay, the place came highly recommended, I got lucky with street parking, we were hungry, we came in wanting to like this place and this counter guy was doing the opening scene on the movie Gravity.  We decided to push past this horrendous intro to Frank N Dawgs and ordered two sandwiches with a side of truffle fries. We sat down and my companion said, ""I'm still trying to like this place"".  Our food was served. Mine was a brat. I later counted the number of ingredients. It was eleven not counting the bread. BTW, their bread is very tasty but to big for the sandwich I had. It was impossible to discern the taste of the undercover brat. I almost needed an emergency response with the"" jaws of life"" to extricate a few pure bites of my brat before declaring it DOA. It wasn't nasty. It was just sooo bland. Like the blandest ""boudin"" sausage you could ever imagine. Thus the 11 ingredients. My companion's sandwich had a similar script. The truffle fries should be renamed as truffle oil with potatoes. We had to wipe our oil soaked fingers each time we went into the basket to retrieve a fry.  All righty then. The history of the Chicago hot dog goes back to the Chicago Worlds Fair in 1893. People visit Chicago from different parts of the country and the world to experience our museum's, architecture, zoos, and our foods. Among them, the Chicago style hot dog. This is a hot dog town. In other cities you will see restaurants that boast Chicago Style Hot Dogs. When people outside of the USA learn I'm from Chicago, they almost invariably mention, Al Capone, Michael Jordan, pizza and hot dogs. So Frank ""N"" Dawgs, instead of honoring the Chicago Hot Dog, denigrates it. Oh, I almost left this out.

2013-10-30,2.0,"Being a hot dog enthusiast and a sausage enthusiast, I was not impressed.   This place, although, is NOT a hot dog joint.  They bill themselves as 5 star dining on a bun, and that is what attracted me - the menu was REALLY fun to read, and I though I was going to get a sausage fantasy fulfilled. But.... The bun was dry, and in my opinion way too large, so a very LARGE dry bun (more like really thick sliced bread).  The actual sausage, which was pretty good in most of the varieties we sampled, was dwarfed the bun - the dry bread that really tasted old - did we just come on a bad day???? Unsure, but the bread/bun was offensive.   The truffle fries were pretty good - but I think many establishments lean on truffle flavored something when the rest of their menu is not strong enough to stand out on its own. Or maybe this really was a bad day/time to come because I found these ""triple truffle fries"" quite dry - were they old?  I have heard many people really gushing over them - but I have had much MUCH better truffle fries at MANY other places. The menu, although, LOOKS like it can stand on its own. I must say VERY inventive and intriguing.  Actually, entertaining. Even more entertaining than Hot Doug's menu!  We ordered the Krazy Kimchi (REALLY GOOD if you stripped the dry bun monstrosity away)  the Cheese Head (meh), a few others (so unmemorable that which choices escape me), the fries... Hot Dougs menu, while maybe not as punchy, delivers MUCH better dogs/sausages EVERY time.  That is why I will wait on that line any time I get the chance. Don't get me wrong, we tried several - and they were ok, so long as about half of the bun was removed.  I mean, they were stellar compared to a hot dog from the grade school cafeteria line... but I have had much better from random hot dog stands in comparison to their ""Chicagoesque"" dog and I have had better sausages elsewhere.",0.9933,0.775,0.178,0.047,0.5597639933166249

What was the grub for $73, you ask?  Two peking duck sausages with scallions and crispy skin (the best part), a corned beef sausage with a hash brown nest and poached egg, pheasant and raisin sausage with chutney and almonds, pork and shrimp sausage with shrimp tempura on top, and sides of truffle waffle fries and cheese curds.  Whew!  With the exception of a 1/3 of a sausage, the 2 of us polished everything off, agreed we had overdone it calorie consumption wise, and rolled out of there.  It was unanimous that the duck sausages were our favorite, and the sides rocked our socks off! As you may have noticed, be prepared for the price point.  This isn't your typical hot dog stand pricing!  Each one will run $10-13, but is a hearty serving. Fun side note: when you dine in, you choose a placecard from the ""wall of shame"" (instead of your typical black number on a white card) to indicate where the servers should send your order.  Choices include Sarah Palin and the Brady Bunch.",0.9434,0.878,0.101,0.021,0.5584523809523809

This place is just a little too high-end for me, which just judging purely from the sign you would assume it was just another hot dog joint, not a gourmet-type restaurant where their basic hot dog is $7-13, so this place isn't exactly cheap. So my only issues with this place is that the hot dogs to me are just ""too much"", not that they taste bad, but I guess I just prefer to dine more simplistically when it comes to dogs/sausages and everything here has multiple toppings and whatnot. To conclude: if you are looking for some creative, fancy type hot dogs that think out of the box and are willing to pay for it, I would come here.  If you are just looking for a quick modest lunch this is probably not for you.",0.643,0.932,0.044,0.024,0.5963435897435897

I thought this was going to be the whateverwefeellike, but it turned into the nice. Why? Because they have awesome stuff here. I'm telling you, the second I got home I started looking them up online so I could see what I was going to have when I came back. That's normal, right?  And also? We walked here from Lincoln Park Zoo. Hey, I'm from the suburbs, we think parking at the end of the lot at Target is a long walk. There are blisters on my feet from hoofing it in sh*tty worn out sandals, but I would do it again.  Onto the food! I did the Dawg Flight so I could try as much as possible. But more on that later. My wife was the clear winner today as she ordered the Bacon Mac 'n Cheese Dog, which was a thing of beauty. The truffle mac 'n cheese is magical. I was feenin' for another bite, even tho I had my own sampler to try. Put that stuff on top of a bacon dog and it's heaven on a bun.  In fact, this truffle business they have going on. Fries, mac 'n cheese, etc. It's a wonderfully wonderful good thing. The fries were like nothing I'd tasted before.  We also did some Fried Green Tomatoes, because, well, we had to. My wife wouldn't have forgiven me if we hadn't. And guess what? She didn't like the coating. I thought it was good. If you get these regularly somewhere else, you can skip them. They're average good. Not the best I've had, but certainly nowhere near bad. They came with a nice basil aoli. Finally, onto my Dawg Flight. I sampled the Krazy Kimchi, the Banh Mi, and the Muscles from Brussels the latter, which was my favorite. Can't say anything bad about it. I didn't care for the Kimchi, but that's not the dog's fault. I hate kimchi. In fact, everyone I know hates kimchi. But apparently since this is one of the most popular dawgs on the menu, not everyone everyone knows hates kimchi. I flicked some of it off and ate the dawg, which in itself wasn't bad. But still not my favorite. The beef sausage was kind of dry.  I'm indifferent toward the Banh Mi. It was tasty, but I think the sausage got a little lost in all the toppings.  Will I return? Yes!  Will I bring friends? Yes! But now that I've sampled a few, I think I know how we should handle this next time. Between my wife and me, we should just order three dawgs and split them so we can sample the most (that is if I can fight that Bacon Mac 'n Cheese away from her).",0.9982,0.74,0.207,0.054,0.5794155120242077

My BF and I ordered the Cheese Head (sausage, gouda, onion, mushrooms), Epic Pork Gasm, triple truffle fries, and the truffle mac and cheese.  I liked (not loved) the Cheese Head - good quality meat, lots of flavor - my only small issue was the toppings seemed a little skimpy.  My boyfriend loved the Epic Pork Gasm - how could he not with the many layers of pig?! As for the side dishes... the triple truffle fries were good and you could definitely taste the truffle but overall I thought they were on the greasy side.  Points for being waffle cut though!  The truffle mac and cheese was the least impressive thing we ordered.  It was under salted / generally under seasoned... aka very bland.  Moreover, the cheese sauce was on the runny side.  If you're debating whether you should get it or not, I would say don't bother. Overall, I left with two issues nagging at me: 1. While the food was pretty good, I don't think it was good enough to justify the prices.  $12 for a hot dog?  After eating said hot dog, I definitely think that's steep. 2.

I just tried this for the first time yesterday and it was filled with so many types of pig and this made my pig face happy. Oink oink. Special Mention: Triple Truffle Fries ($4.95) - Yukon Gold waffle cut fries, truffle oil, truffle butter, truffle salt & freshly chopped herbs. These fries are the best fries on the face on the planet. I'm not big on fries but these have my heart. They are soaked in everything truffle leading to an explosion of flavor in your mouth - no ketchup needed! And there are still SO many more hot dogs on the menu I want to try. It's hard to try new doggies when I know the fantastic ones here and always want to stick to the tried & true meats. I have yet to try the Corn Dog Flight ($7.95) or normal ol' Hot Dog Flight ($15 for 3 half dogs). Yesterday the three in the hot dog flight were Sogni di Porcellino, Tur-Doggin and the Krazy Kimchi but they are always changing. Come to Franks n Dawgs and experience what a real gourmet Chicago hot dog is! AND ---- BYOB!!!!",0.9905,0.848,0.13,0.022,0.6177744342378491

Apparently, FnD has been featured on a ton of food and travel shows garnering attention for their house-made sausages and interesting flavor combinations; Seeing the accolades displayed outside, I knew I was in for a good meal - JACKPOT! The entrance can be confusing because there's a door in front of the restaurant, but that's the actually the exit. To get to the entrance, you have to go down a creepy little alley. Once you're in, the space is small with booths on both sides of the restaurant. The menu is posted on the wall and you place your order at the window; when your order's ready, they bring your food to the table.

Service and space (back patio) were great, and the 15-minute wait was fine.  But Phil's Last Stand and Haute & the Dog do a great dog for less than half the price, and I just think that price matters with choices as good as the ones in Chicago.  Hell, even Hot Doug's is not expensive, so these prices just seem way out of whack with other hot dog stands in town.  $6 is the minimum, and you can drop $13 on a dog at this place!",0.9183,0.861,0.099,0.04,0.5317307692307691

2013-07-17,4.0,"I didnt have too much expectation coming into Franks n Dawgs. Everything from the logo to the aesthetic of the restaurant's website is a little out-dated and cheesy. Although they have the worst slogan ever, ""5 star dinning on a bun"" (tourist trap much?)- at the end of the day, Franks 'n' Dawgs is serving up some delicious and tasty sausages.  Food: Brunch Dog - Pork Loin sausage, fried egg, bacon, drizzled with maple mayo.The sausage was moist, porky and not greasy at all. The maple mayo added a nice touch of sweetness to the savory bacon. Good balance of sweet vs savory - overall it captured the essence and taste of a traditional breakfast platter. Even Graham Elliot recommended it on F&W magazine!  Great White - Scallop sausage, shark bacon, pineapple relish and cilantro. This one caught my eyes right away when I was ordering. Bay Scallop sausage -made in house? The taste of the sausage is exactly as expected - the fresh scallop flavor really shines through. Its unique, but the texture is a little more mushy than I like. Pineapple relish and cilantro were pretty much non-existance, they were too delicate to compliment the strong seafood flavor. The shark bacon was a little fishy and salty, didnt help the balance of flavor. Sausage was good, but the condiments were disappointing.  Triple Truffle Fries - These fries are soaked in truffle flavor. Truffle butter, truffle salt, truffle oil. If you're a fan of truffle, do not miss this. For me, it was just trying too hard.  Great casual spot for some truly gourmet hot dogs. I love that most of the sausages on their menu are made in-house.(TIP: look for the little chef hat on the menu) There are real men working in the kitchen, calling out orders, and making every hot dog to order.

He'll ""see what he can do"" - never comes back.

We had a Brunch dog and Salmon dog. Both were OK but nothing incredible. The food sounds really good on the menu but is overpriced for what you get. The Brunch dog had a piece of egg shell in it. On the way out I spoke with the manager to give him some feedback from this unpleasant first-time experience. I got an ""I'm sorry"" for the egg shell, and a ""thank you"" for my feedback as he's walking away from me.

2013-04-16,4.0,"Never liked hot dogs much until moving to Chicagoland five years ago. But I never knew they could be bold, innovative and gourmet ... and without chili as a topping (I'm a former metro Detroiter who frequented National Coney Island diners). So after seeing this spot on the Cooking Channel, I immediately bookmarked it on Yelp and put it on my Chicago Bucket List. When friends from out of town visited this weekend and we worked up an appetite after walking around the Lincoln Park Zoo, it seemed like the appropriate time to try it out. Moments to remember: *Super casual atmosphere with BYOB and funny celeb photos as table markers. *Varied menu with too much I wanted to try - finally chose the Double Duck. It was incredibly filling and rich with the juicy duck confit, rich pate, spicy arugula, savory grain mustard, etc. on top of the thick sausage all within the buttery toasted bun.  *Fun and unusual sides - I went with the Brussel Sprouts Salad that was a refreshing complement to the rich dog. The fresh sprouts were shaved thinly, tossed in zesty lemon juice and mixed up with crunchy pistachios and salty parm. *Ultra friendly guests - A woman sitting next to me and my friends gave us her entire bowl of Triple Truffle Fries because she was full from her hot dog. We gobbled up the fries because they were crispy on the outside, soft on the side with the right amount of seasoning. Couldn't believe we scored the $5 side for free spontaneously. Moments not to remember: *Tables and counter space were not regularly maintained - empty bottles and crumpled up napkins lingered on emptied areas. Although, I understand that it was a generally busy Saturday afternoon. *Truffle Mac N' Cheese was a bit too oily and not as cheesy as I would like",0.9919,0.848,0.147,0.005,0.5823753169907017

2013-04-04,1.0,"As much as I want to enjoy these upscale hot dog joints I always find myself disappointed after I pay my tab and realize that the food wasn't nearly adequate enough in both taste and portion. My visit here today went as follows. 1. Chicagoesque: All natural (nitrate free & uncured) 100% beef artisan 1/8 pound skinless frank , house pickles, cherry tomato relish, caramelized onions & beer mustard. This dog which costs a whopping $5.45 was a joke. Aside from the boring, skimpy toppings, the dog itself was horrid. Flat tasting, no snap, and just soft and mushy. Awful... 2. Waffle Fries-Yukon Gold waffle cut fries - twice fried. At $3.00 per serving this actually tends too be an alright deal. The flavor is decent and the crispiness was spot on. However at $3.00 you could be so much more generous and creative considering how cheap potatoes are in bulk. Scam... 3. Fried Pickles- Matilda beer battered bread 'n' butter pickles served with giardiniera aioli. This was the biggest con of the entire meal. I believe there were 12 total pickle slices in the entire serving and @ $4.00 this was unimaginable. How can you honestly serve these with a straight face? Your telling me that for $4.00 all you can muster up is 12? Besides the fact that they are not that good, the utter idea that you can serve just twelve is preposterous. F'ing joke...

We tried the Lamb-orghini, the Pork of July, and the Krazy Kimchi. Each were delicious, though the Lamb-orghini was the standout of the 3, although the Kimchi paired best with the bun.

2013-03-01,3.0,"When I first visited Franks 'N' Dawgs, I was really hyped since I've heard nothing but great things. Unfortunately, the more often I've gone, the more disappointments I've experienced.  The place is a little weird, since you have to walk through a little alley to get to the actual restaurant. The line (yes, there's going to be one) extends outside the door, so beware in the winter months. When you place your order, they give you a funky picture to put on your table to bring your food to you after. It's a comic touch and I can dig it. It's BYOB, but I learned that a little too late so I did not take part in bottle-popping. The first time I went was last summer and had the Sighing Fu, their vegetarian dog. I'm a pescatarian but didn't know of their fish options until later. The bun was yummy, warm and soft and the truffle fries were pretty damn good but the dog itself was just ok. I love Indian food so I was excited to try their take in hot dog form. It was way too spicy and the dog just wasn't that good. It took me about 15 minutes to get my mouth to return to its normal temperature because I was literally dying. The flavors were ok, nothing out of this world but I didn't want to base my review just on that, so I gave it another shot. A few months later, I tried the Slammin' Salmon dog and it was just horrific. It tasted like I just opened up a .99 can of Salmon and plopped it onto bread and closed it up. Zero flavor, no seasonings and it was bitter cold. I was so disappointed, I scooped out the insides and just ate the roll. This was a carry-out order, so I didn't feel like walking back at night just to complain. The prices are pretty high for hot dogs and I understand they use exotic stuff, but for a simple person like me, it's not my cup of tea.

I didn't know what to expect before going in there and thought I'd be getting a ""glorified"" version of a regular Chicago dog. My mistake folks. They had gourmet dogs. Crazy delicious gourmet dogs. I purchased the Tur-Doggin (Turkey & date sausage, crispy duck confit, herb garlic aioli, pickled onion relish & pickled carrots), acclaimed by the Cooking Channel, Chicago's Best, and 190 North. I also ordered the Triple Truffle Fries (Yukon Gold waffle cut fries, truffle oil, truffle butter, truffle salt & freshly chopped herbs) alongside my dog.

The lobster roll was awful and very vinegary*. There was no flavor what soever. There isn't much that needs to be done to lobster, it really does stand on its own. Not here, the lobster meat itself  was a weird consistency that I wasn't familiar with as if it weren't truly lobster. The truffle cheese fries were incredible, you can't get fries of this caliber anywhere else. Also the bread that the sausages are served on is mind blowing.

I, on the other hand, took my sausage and bun forcefully, gripped it with two hands and munched away on its flavor and texture in about one-fourth the time as my friend. I spent the rest of my time watching the deconstruction across the table. I had the spicy beef sausage with Kimchi and other toppings. He had the Pork Loin sausage with equally creative toppings. We shared some waffle fries. We didn't spend a lot of time with the menu: but clearly, there are so many great combinations to try. I love the style of buns which are your standard Lobster Roll style vs. the common hot dog bun. All crispy and buttery and soft. And there is a lobster roll on the menu ($17.95) Service is the hybrid variety like Hot Doug's (apologize for that reference, guys.) You order at the counter-they bring it to you. The staff was great. Our server was very outgoing and helpful. The bill was $26.00 for two, So OK for the lunch budget. And I left a tip here, which I don't always do at a self-serve. It was well-deserved. By the way, the sausage fest theme carries through to staffing. They were all guys. It was easy to get in and get out on a weekday afternoon, which is a real positive. I could do without the esoteric ""mixed tape"" which we all had to listen to. The place would be just fine without music.

Very comparable to Hot Dougs but with it's own flare (and wildly more convenient to Lincoln Park dwellers) I give this place my definite stamp of approval. They have a bunch of great sides (truffle mac and cheese) as well, the only slight downside is it can get a little pricey in the end. We split three dogs and two sides between two people and it cam out to around $40 (bear in mind that was plenty of food and we didn't even finish all of it). Otherwise it's a great spot for a small group, not a ton of space inside so groups of four to six tops I think- but you can carry out as well.

2012-11-25,2.0,"Having recently heard rave reviews from Check, Please! (on which it won a rare three concurring positive reviews) and word-of-mouth alike, my girlfriend and I recently stopped at Franks N' Dawgs while we were in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Unfortunately, it seemed that we were not the only ones who had recently been enticed by the glowing reviews on Check, Please! and I was disappointed to learn that the lobster roll, the banner item at Franks N' Dawgs, had been sold out for hours.  The staff was very conciliatory about the situation and bought drinks and dessert for us.   Having had the rug pulled out from underneath us, we were unsure of what to order.  Fortunately, the staff was very helpful in this regard, and we ordered the ""Lamb-orghini,"" a lamb sausage, and the ""Pork of July,"" a polish sausage that features caramelized onions.  Both the selections were quite tasty, and I had an overall positive experience.  Nevertheless, I decided to hold off on writing a review until trying their famed lobster roll. Finding myself in the neighborhood weeks later, I dropped in again to sink my teeth into the savory seafood treat.  I was kind of taken aback by the price of the sandwich, which weighed in at a hefty $20.  I figured it must be worth it after all the positive feedback it had received, so I ordered one for my girlfriend and one for myself.  To my surprise, the roll was embarrassingly below par.  I truly couldn't taste the lobster and, halfway through eating it, I seriously wondered if I were eating potato salad. Taking the sum of my experiences into perspective, I must give Franks N' Dawgs a 2/5; even though my first experience was positive, I cannot say that I couldn't have had a more positive experience in any number of sausage shacks in Chicago.  The lobster roll is a load of hype and a complete rip-off.",0.98,0.836,0.123,0.041,0.49280303030303024

The ingredients blended in well together with the sausage, but there were some kinks here and there. Well, at least with my double ducker.  With my double ducker, the sausage was not great on its own. It needed all the toppings in every bite and the toppings were not evenly distributed and enough to spread across the entire hot dog. I just wanted a little more cohesion with the whole thing.  The krazy kimchi one was tasty. My own suggestion is that they serve the kimchi cold and put it on the hot dog last because hot, soggy kimchi is not very good.  My favorite items were the waffle fries and the bun!

The sampler also included their fries.   The Lamb-orghini was amazing and the Fourth of July special was a close second.  I wasn't much a fan of the Tur-Doggin; the casing was tough and the meat had a slightly odd flavor.  The fries came out piping hot and were tasty but didn't hold as nice a flavor once they cooled off - I recommend eating them quickly with the jalapeno ketchup.

I'm also mac n cheese obsessed. But its amaaazing. I'd order the mac n cheese plain but combined with the dog it's heavenly. The Tur-Doggin I didn't like as much. That doesn't mean it's not good.

My boyfriend got the Porkgasm and before I could remember to ask for a bite, it was gone and he said he loved it, so that's that. The buns are different but they're good. I still prefer your traditional hotdog bun though, because I like the bread to meat ratio better.  These buns are just too much bread for me and it gets in the way of the contents of the bun. We got there right when they opened at 11:30 on a Friday. It wasn't crowded when we got there or when we left. We also had no problem finding parking on Clybourne, however by the time we left at noon, the street was all parked up.

The truffle fries are delicious, the same ones they serve at The Peasantry.  They must be double fried because they're crispy and golden, not the typical soggy mess waffle fries can be.

To be honest, I would've been perfectly content with just their pulled pork and the cherry bourbon BBQ sauce on the bun, but the link was delicious too. Speaking of the bun, that's the star of the show here at Franks 'n' Dawgs. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that it's probably the best bun I've ever had. It was buttery and rich, and soft and chewy on the inside. And it was toasted to a perfect golden color. It looks like a thick piece of brioche that's been sliced down the middle and has an almost contorted or folded shape.

There are a ton of dawgs to choose from, all described equally deliciously, so to get a taste of some of the best they had to offer I ordered the Dawg Flight which comes with a chef's choice of three different half sausage sandwiches and fries though I upgraded to a side of the ultra savory triple truffle fries. My Dawg Flight consisted of the KRAZY KIMCHI (spicy beef sausage, braised short rib, turnips, kimchi, toasted wild rice and basil), the SPRING VEAL (veal sausage, asparagus, spring mushrooms, shaved red onions and cured egg yolk), and the TUR-DOGGIN (turkey and date sausage, crispy duck confit, herb garlic aioli, pickled onion relish and pickled carrots).  Each was equally unique in terms of flavor and very tasty.  I enjoyed them all but my favorite of the three was probably the Tur-Doggin.  No need for extra condiments to dress the dogs here, it would probably be considered sacrilegious to do so actually. The Triple Truffle Fries were extremely decadent as these crisscut fries were cooked using truffle oil, truffle butter and topped with truffle salt.  Yeah, the heavenly truffle flavor was plainly evident. Bringing a little bit of extra levity, instead of having number placards associated with your order you get to choose a photo of a celebrity from their wall of shame for the servers to identify your order.  Some of these characters include Michael Vick, Mel Gibson, Meg from Family Guy, and plenty others.  I chose The Hoff.  Haha!

It had a serious Reuben taste. Delicious. The Krazy Kimchi was pretty good, for some reason I was expecting the braised short rib was going to be more sweet like a Kal-bi, but it was just plain braised short rib, which was still good, just less Korean tasting. The kimchi was good, not too strong on the pickled taste, just enough to add to the flavor of the dog.  The Frank n'Stein was oh so rich. It was definitely yummy, but probably too much for us to take by the end of the meal (yes I shared three dogs and fries with just one other person).

2012-03-04,4.0,"I came here with a bunch of friends on a Saturday afternoon. Someone in our group suggested we each here. They hyped it up for me by saying that it's better than Hot Doug's. But honestly, I like Hot Doug's better.  I tried the Franken' Stein (foie gras based) and the truffle mac & cheese. The Franken' Stein was not as amazing as Hot Doug's foie gras hot dog. For these two portions (the mac and cheese was really really small), I had to pay over $15. That's a ton of money for one hot-dog and a measly bowl of mac and cheese.  But aside from the price, and me constantly comparing it to another hot dog joint, Franks 'N' Dawgs is quite delicious. The selections are varied (extremely creative). If you are craving a more breakfast fare, then they have it. If you crave the traditional Chicago style hot dog, they have that too. Ultimately, though the food was above average, it's a place I would revisit only to show it to my non-Chicago friends. I don't think I would return to this place to eat regularly.",0.9518,0.864,0.113,0.023,0.6966783216783217

2012-03-03,5.0,"On this glorious Saturday, much to my dog delight, Franks 'N' Dawgs delivered. If I weren't so full, I'd immediately go back and eat some more. My only regret is that I couldn't try everything on the menu. Though for two people we came close.  Aside from the amazing meats and how beautiful the hot dogs looked (I know it sounds silly, but the presentation was beautiful!) their buns (New England Style Lobster Rolls, buttered and toasted) are crazy good and the truffle fries are absolutely, completely, unequivocally the best. I didn't dare use ketchup... and I adore condiments.  The place isn't very big and you'll most likely have to wait for a table if you get there at prime eatin' hours. But I promise you it's worth it. To make life easy while ordering, they have an Ipad there to scroll through the menu in case you haven't made up your mind by reading the sign. Thought that was a nice touch. For a little kitsch, you get to pick a celebrity from their wall of shame so they know how to find your table. Very creative rather than just giving a name or a table number.  Now, for the only reason you're reading this -- the FOOD. (If I were religious I'd be making a sign of the cross right now). They have a Dawg Flight - Highly recommended if you want to try a few different tastes. It's 1/2 of 3 hot dogs and truffle fries so it's a lot of food. Ours came with The Southerner, Tur-Doggin and Krazy Kimchi. We had also asked the guy at the counter what his favorites were. So we also ordered the Tur-Doggin (not knowing it was on the sampler) and the Sweet Veal. I would highly recommend the Tur-Doggin. Hands down our favorite. The Southerner was also amazing! And again - do not leave without eating the truffle fries. The orders are smaller, but they are big, waffle cut fries. So I still think 2 people can share easily. But if you're in a total pig-out mood, get your own.  We ended the delight with the Key Lime S'more. It was alright. But looking back I'd have rather tried the mac n cheese for dessert :) Our smorgasboard of delights came out to $45. Pricey, but we ordered a bit too much food for 2 people. I think you could easily get away with a dog a person and split a fry and leave for $30-$35. Which I feel is reasonable for how good the food is.",0.9981,0.759,0.216,0.025,0.6074316046765026

It might be 1/2 the reason why it's slightly overpriced, but still a fun place to go to.  It's like someone took the idea of a Chicago dog and said, let's try to make it look magazine fancy.

2012-02-22,4.0,"Everyone knows Doug Sohn's semi-eponymous Hot Doug's is the king of unique and imaginative combinations of the meat-in-tube-form arts. I, myself, braved the long line in the frigid Chicago winter several years ago to eat at Hot Doug's and found it to be the best hot dogs/sausages I've ever had. But recently, I had heard about a competitor to the throne. His name is Joe Doren and he boasts at having ""5 star dining on a bun"" at his restaurant. You know that during this Chicago trip it was a must to stop there. There was a short line of eager patrons waiting to provide their order to the man himself Chef Doren, who was cheerfully at the register. No problem, it gave us time to choose what we wanted. The Lyonnaise Fries, Sweet Veal Dog, Brunch Dog, and Chicagoesque Dog would be our selections. Lyonnaise Fries: This could be a meal in itself. Delicious golden fries, chunks of juicy braised pork, a smattering of frisee, and sitting atop of it all is a beautiful poached egg orb. Puncture the orb and a golden river of egg yolk dribbles down all over the other components creating a luscious sauce. The only downside was that the fries can get soggy, possibly from the juices of the braised pork and a little from the egg yolk.  Sweet Veal Dog: I was uncertain what the third dog would be. So I asked Chef Doren what he recommended. And this is the one he chose for me. Hmm...I was excited to try this but it wasn't a hit for me. The bacon cured sweetbreads were dry and partially leathery in texture. The pickled chanterelles and corn were too overwhelmingly acidic. My palate was awash with pickling juices and my mouth would almost pucker at every bite. If you don't like that feeling, probably best stay away from this dog. Brunch Dog: A dog I had seen on TV and immediately fell in love with. Thank you, Andrew Zimmern for showing this on your Chicago episode. My life's quest turned to eating that dog. It IS breakfast in a bun. The meaty pork loin sausage, smokey and salty bacon, drizzled with sweet maple mayo. Oh yeah, and adorned with a sunny side up fried egg. Heavenly. I wish I could eat this for breakfast every single day. And I would gladly be on Lipitor to do so. Chicagoesque Dog: She wanted to get this since she fell in love with the traditional Chicago dog at Portillo's. It winks to the traditional dog, but it has an identity all its own. You get sweet from the grilled onions, tangy from the beer mustard, and a bright fruitiness from the tomato relish. It's a solid dog, but I would choose more of the imaginative dogs before selecting this one again. So does Franks N Dawgs knock off Hot Doug's off its throne? I'd have to say no, not quite yet. The value at Hot Doug's, the game meat sausages, the foie gras dog, and those sinfully good duck fat fries appeal to me more. But this does not mean I won't come back to Franks N Dawgs. It just means I'll have to bring out my inner Joey Chestnut to sample dogs from both.",0.9969,0.828,0.144,0.028,0.6056468253968256
2012-02-20,4.0,"*update* I got to try the Frankenstein and Double Ducker. I wasn't a big fan of either. For the Frankenstein, all I tasted was onion and this sauce that tasted like champagne to me. The sausage was only there for texture.  For the Double Ducker, it's more my preference but I never thought I would ever say, ""too much duck!"". I never realized how gamey duck tasted until now and I have VERY low gamey tolerance. I was saying how the truffle fries weren't worth it last time but this time, they were ohhhh so much better. There wasn't a big pile of oil sitting on the bottom and the truffle taste was very present this time. It's still so pricey but it edged me closer to thinking it's worth it. *end update* --- I agree that Franks n Dawgs is kinda pricey but you kind of pay for the location and size of the dog. They have an interesting bun choice... It looks like a giant piece of sandwich bread that is cut and ""stuffed"". It's different! Doughy and slightly crunchy... I really liked it. I wanted to try the franken stein dog but it was sold out! So I got the kimchi dog instead and  thought it was deliiiicious.  It was a bit overloaded so I had trouble eating it but the flavors were good. I could have used a little more kimchi since I wanted a little more kimchi oomph. I mean... it IS called a kimchi dog! The truffle fries came in some tiny little bowl and was not worth it in my opinion.  It was good but too pricey for what you get.  The KetChipotle with fries was so yummy that I bought a bottle to bring to work. Next time, I'm going to come back and share my dog with someone else so I can try two at once!  We came around 1pm on a sunday and it was pretty empty.

2012-02-17,4.0,"Everything about Frank and Dawgs is carefully crafted, from their non-traditional gourmet hot-dogs to their equally gourmet appetizers and sides. I would only extend the word ""gourmet"" to the food and its preparers, as the atmosphere is everything you would want in a hot dog joint-- relaxed and conveniently located with friendly, upbeat staff. Each dog and side has a number of gourmet ingredients, each well thought out and working with the dish. You will have a hard time picking a dog and side as the variety is tremdous. The truffle fries are fantastic but I wouldn't rule out the Brussel Sprouts Salad or the Creole red beans. I prefer Frank and Dawgs to Hot Doug's, though I am still a big fan of both. I have seen a few gimmicky imitation hot dog joints that boast non-traditional ingredients, but don't come anywhere close to these two in taste and quality. There's a care in their gourmet ingredients that just is not matched.  Dawgs meets and exceeds Doug's in both taste, quality, variety, and presentation. It's my preference. They're both fantastic, but I find Frank and Dawgs to be a little more fresh. Though it's slightly more expensive, it has normal operating hours and accepts credit/debit. So you don't have to have a day off to get Dawgs during the week and you won't have to wait an hour just to order on the weekend. Doug's is delicious, but their preparation is a little sloppy at times. You will never get a smashed bun at Dawgs as their MO would never allow it. On the flip side, hot dog purest might not like that the bun more closely resembles a carefully constructed texas-toast-like hoagie, but this is a plus to me. Again, I am a fan of both Doug's and Dawgs, it's just nice to be able to get a great Hot Dog on my own time.

2012-02-16,5.0,"I came across this place on accident. Well, not really on accident, because since Yelp came around accidents are pretty much obsolete for me.  I had been dying to try a Chicago dog, as repulsing as it looked/sounded, and was nearing the end of my week long visit. Superdawg was bookmarked, but without access to a car it was looking more and more unlikely that we'd be able to hit it up. So after browsing Yelp/Serious Eats I came across Franks 'N' Dogs. Without bothering to check the hours I headed over with my friend early on a Monday - only to find it closed. Lesson learned...or so I thought. I ended up going to Downtown Dogs that day, but after seeing photos of that Brunch Dog, I knew I had to come back the next day (and the last day of my visit). I showed up about 30 minutes before it opened, because clearly I hadn't really learned my lesson - and still didn't know how to properly check the hours - so I wandered around Crate & Barrel to kill some time. At 11:31am I reappeared. I wound up waiting on a short line that had already formed despite the place just opening and when my order was ready to be taken my mouth was already watering. I asked for some recommendations before ultimately deciding on the Brunch Dog, a pear iced tea, and a Sarah Palin placard. (She's my hero.) I really wanted to try the truffle fries, but didn't want to over eat since I still had a few more places to try before catching my flight. So I (foolishly) opted out. Turns out this nice guy (I'm pretty sure he was a vendor for F&D) didn't want to eat all his fries and offered me a couple... wow. I can't believe I didn't order them. I'm kicking myself just thinking about them. They were so good. No, really....so good. Don't be an idiot like a certain ""Steak Expert"" - just get them.  You: ""Oh, but they're fatty."" Me: ""How dare you! You're the one in a sausage/hot dog place. Maybe you're the one who's 'fatty.'""  You: ""Ouch."" Me: ""Sorry, that was a little much... just order the fries. Thanks."" Next up: The Brunch Dog. The most amazing sausage I have ever consumed. I am not lying about this. I wouldn't ever lie about something so serious. From the sausage itself, to the fried egg on top, to the bacon, to the maple mayo, right down to the bun... it was just absolutely perfect. A perfect, sloppy, mess.. that was straight up scrumptious. I will never have another sausage like it - and for that I am extraordinarily saddened. I mean maple mayo? WHAT GENIUS THOUGHT OF THAT? My stomach is weeping at the thought of it. I'm weeping at the thought of it.  Needless to say I left Franks 'N' Dawgs with a huge smile and gave myself a pat on the back for making the effort to get there before I headed back to NY.

The plain fries were really good but the truffle fries are everything I have ever dreamed about.  Many places overuse truffle in an attempt to make their fries ""the most truffle-y.""  Even though these have truffle butter, truffle oil and truffle salt, they were perfectly balanced.  It's the balance that makes Franks 'N' Dawgs stand out.  I will definitely be back for more, especially when the outdoor dining section is open.",0.8866,0.852,0.098,0.05,0.5885714285714286

To start off, we got there around 2pm and the place had some people in it but there was no line and plenty of place to sit down - just how I like it.  The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful.  The first thing the girl behind the counter asked was if we had ever been to Franks N Dawgs before and we both said no.  She then helped us navigate the menu a little bit (chef's hats on the menu means the sausage is made in-house, etc.) and pointed out the iPad on the counter that would show us pictures of all the wonderful creations this place has come up with. We settled on the Frank'n Stein and the Chicagoesque with an order of Triple Truffle Fries and an order of regular fries.  I had the Frank'n Stein because I am a sucker for anything having to do with foie gras.  My friend had the Chicagoesque.  Both were very good.  I can't say I tasted the foie gras directly but the overall flavor of the Frank'n Stein was unbelievable.  The dogs come on those same buns that lobster rolls usually do and you could just eat that alone and it would be good.  I suppose this ""breaks"" tradition of using a poppy seed bun or whatever but who cares?  All I care about is if it tastes good...and it does! The regular fries were OK.  Something I had never seen before was that this restaurant offers two ketchup alternatives: Ketchapeno & Ketchipotle.  I'm from Milwaukee so not sure if this is something unique to Chicago or something I just haven't seen yet where I live.  Both have a slight kick but the Ketchipotle has a smoky flavor to it so if you aren't into that you probably won't like it.  I thought the Ketchapeno was pretty good and gave the fries the extra little kick they needed. Now, let's get to those Triple Truffle Fries.  I knew they would be good from the second I smelled them when they came to our table.  They looked and smelled like they came from heaven.  White truffle oil.  Truffle butter.  Truffle salt.  Oh. My. God.  And they weren't greasy at all.  It might be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth.  They were so good we talked about coming back later that night and just ordering these fries for dinner.  So good.  Do not order any other sides if you come to this restaurant.  Just order these...a lot of them. The place is fun as you get to pick from national and local ""celebrity"" picture magnets at the counter where you order to take back to your table so the staff knows who ordered what.  Franks N Dawgs is kind of expensive for cased meats, but then again they just aren't slapping a hot dog in a bun.

The food: Oh, my! I had trouble figuring out what I wanted, so I actually made a blind choice (silly me) and went with the Bacon n' Grits. It surely isn't anywhere near the best dog I've had, and certainly not the best I've even had in Chicago, but it was tasty regardless. It was a large, natural-casing dog, and it had a bit of a crunch from the puffed grits. The pork belly wasn't very prominent and I had trouble tasting it (though I could see the large pieces atop my dog). The other toppings weren't really evident either. Would I order it again? Probably not considering the rest of the menu and its seemingly endless selection. The fries. THE FRIES. So I did come here with two friends and we decided to each get one of their special fries. One friend got the cheese fries--they were alright. My other friend got the triple truffle fries--they were pretty bomb. I got the Lyonnaise fries--HOLY SHOOT ME NOW. These fries are worth coming for by themselves. The pig cheek and fried egg turn this into devil's food with the amount of richness they incorporate into the fries.

2012-01-04,3.0,"It's so hard to not compare this with other housemade sausage shops in town, especially when the other one's sooooooooo good, but i'll try to keep this FnD centric and keep the comparison's till the end (if you make it that far) I've been in to F n D's many times - 6-7 probably.  They have a great range of selections, both in general, and seasonally (BLT dog is my favorite dog here, but in the winter it comes off the menu because you can't get a tomato worth it's weight in salt in Chicago till summer). The sausages are good, and although the flavor combos of toppings SOUND good, i've been left wondering what would this have tasted like if the toppings were done right!  Here's a couple specific examples of what i'm talking about. Smokin Trout - Good flavor, great trout, great smokiness -  toppings worked out great with the trout, but i think the trout was sitting in the rear most part of the refrigerator, and was only scooped out the split second before it was served to me because I swear, like Flick, I thought my tongue was going to stick to it with the first bite.  it was FREEZING cold.  Now, I'm absolutely one for sanitary conditions, and not leaving things like smoked trout salad next to the grill for three days, but it was a shock.  first because it wasn't a sausage (WHAT?), secondly because it was sooo cold, it was completely unenjoyable. The Southerner - why on earth is there cornbread, on TOP of this dog?  hint - ditch the bun, and serve this ON cornbread. Peking Duck - I swear i thought the puffed rice were little fried worms or something crazy for the first couple bites of this dog.  This definitely was one of the better dogs I've had here.  Great flavor combination, for some reason i think it was double cased (i know it wasn't), because the casing on the sausage seemed to be much harder to get through than most - this is a good dog though - if you go, try it, you won't be disappointed. Da Ringer - Good sausage.  Bacon on top?  Winner! Sides?  I know, 95% of the people that read this would smack me in the face, but when there are all these sausages to pick from, I'd rather double down on dogs and skip the fried taters, pickles, curds, etc... I had the Red Beans once...that'll never happen again.  If you like fries I hear they're good. Overall FnD's is a good lunch spot if you're in the area.   I think FnD's could benefit from a little more salt IN the sausages.  They use great meat, have great combinations of spices in the sausages, but sometimes, i just wish there was a little salt in the meat to perk up the flavors. Final scores  Sausages - that's what this place is all about right? 4 stars toppings (more the execution of said toppings) -  3 stars overall options and selection - 4 stars Just a little tweaking and this place could soar, you certainly can't beat the fact that you're not waiting outside for 30 minutes to get in, but i think there's a reason why you're not. As for the comparison between this and the other local shop, i'll just say this, I've never been sitting in the other shop, thinking about FnD's sausages, but pretty much every time I'm in FnD's, I'm thinking about HD's.",0.999,0.785,0.191,0.023,0.48497732426303863

All these fresh ingredients is what had earned them featured segments on Food Network  and Travel Channel. With all the hype, I had to try this place out. You first walk down a narrow hallway covered with astro turf. You finally make your way inside and above the cashier is the whole lot of sausages that you can order. If you did not have the luxury of checking out the photos of each hot dog online, you're in luck, as there is an iPad by the cash register, where you not only get to pre-judge each hot dog by its contents, but also how visually appealing they look. Because like they say, looks are always the first attraction. If you have any questions, Alexander, who operates the cashier and is the owner, is very friendly and more than helpful in making any suggestions. After you put you order in, you get to pick a photo of a celebrity from the wall of shame as your calling card. You grab a seat and prop the photo beside your table so the staff can easily identify  who to serve each order to. For my first visit, I ordered the Boar'n To Be Wild ($9.95), a rendang wild boar sausage topped with togarashi tempura onions, yellow peppers, fried sweet potatoes, Thai basil, mint & sesame seeds.  The wild boar sausage did indeed have a nice crunch to the skin and tasted fresh, but it didn't have a lot of flavor like a sausage usually does. I was hoping the frizzled pieces of battered onions and sweet potatoes to give it some sweetness, but it was so subtle that it didn't really do much for me. The yellow peppers were a nice addition to give it some color, but that seemed like its only purpose. I also didn't see or taste any Thai basil or mint. With all these letdowns, I didn't really enjoy the Boar'n To Be Wild. And for $10, I thought prices were a bit steep. The New England style roll was indeed light, yet sturdy enough to not succumb to the soggy and crumbling bun that some vendors make the mistake of. It had a thin layer of butter on the outside, then grilled to give it a nice golden crust, but I would have liked for my bun to be grilled a little bit more giving it a minor black toast color. I also tried the Truffle Mac 'n' Cheese ($6.95), a bratwurst sausage topped with truffle mac 'n' cheese and parmesan brioche bread crumbs. It was simple but tasty, but not enough to warrant a second bite. The bratwurst was average at best and the mac 'n' cheese could have used a sharper and creamier cheese to give it a richer profile. They did get the New England roll right this time. It was left on the griddle longer to give it a golden and black toast color. The Fries ($1.75) served in a white ceramic bowl were subpar. They were greasy and potatoey, but didn't maintain a crisp outside, and easily forgettable. The Triple Truffle Fries ($4.95), waffle cut Yukon Gold potatoes seasoned with truffle oil, truffle butter and truffle salt were amazingly good. They were crisp on the outside with a starchy inside, and contained a subtle salt flavor with a hint of aromatic truffle oil. The Triple Truffle Fries are definitely a must-try. I left Franks 'N' Dawgs sort of let down and disappointed. Prices are not justifiable unless you consider freshly homemade artisanal sausage with all natural ingredients worth your money. I may come back to give Franks 'N' Dawgs another chance and try one of their more popular dogs, but I prefer to go to Portillo's for some simple out-of-this-world hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches.",0.9978,0.838,0.136,0.026,0.4611415358403309

Also, the selection on the menu is mind boggling; I didn't know you could do so many dam things to a HOT DOG!!  The two that are always particularly good to me are the ""FU DOG"" which happens to be vegetarian, and the ""CHINA TOWN DOG"" which is a Chinese 5 spice duck sausage, pickled lotus roots, scallion radish slaw & Mae Ploy chili sauce.  There's like 50 more on the menu if you can come enough to try em all.  I think it's one of Chicago's treasures and fine treats, I feel Chi Town citizens are lucky to have access to it. Alexander the owner is such a gentle guy, that you can't but help enjoy the food even more because you internally feel the food has been prepared with love.  He's a quite and kind dude and he's happy to have you, that's a big plus in my book.  And speaking of sweet, the deserts are to die for. Nothing like a filling gourmet hot dog to be followed with a gourmet piece of heaven for desert.

We both decided upon The Cheesehead which was a 10+!  It arrived amazingly well-plated for presentation and the made-on-premises dog, really a high quality sausage, was superb.  Equally outstanding was the ""bun"" which was reminiscent of a top quality lobster roll found along the Maine coastline. It was perfectly grilled & hand-split for accommodating the dog and other ingredients.  This place even has a unique-to-Chicago ketchup called ""Ketchapeno"" that was also a 10 on the condiment scale. It had the perfect kick that added to the overall experience.

I don't really like tofu dogs, nor any other meat facsimile (your Boca Burger, your veggie sausage links).  Luckily, they don't make their vegetarian sandwich a wanna-be meat sandwich.  It celebrates and elevates tofu for what it is: a protein source that will taste like what you pair it with.  Theirs is dressed up with portabello mushroom, eggplant relish, goat cheese (fine, chevre) and a green spread that is suspiciously like pesto.  Is that a fine-tasting tofu or what?     Also on my first visit, they were out of the Brussels sprouts salad, which made me both sad and glad: sad for me, but glad that anyone consuming the dozens of types of meat on the menu was also getting some greens in too.  Today though, they had it, we had it, and it was unusual and wonderful.  The B-sprouts are shredded and tossed with shaved Parmesan, pistachios and some citrus.  Bold and beautiful.   Finally, the icing on the cake of the Franks N Dawgs experience is the service.  (But Beth D., this is a counter-service hot dog place.  What service?)  This service: the charming Australian who takes your order is helpful, cheeky, and knows his franks from his dawgs.  If he were a Yelp review, he'd be through the roof on Useful/Funny/Cools.  I think he has something to do with the selection of celebrities/ass clowns you use to identify your table after you order.   Also, the small staff of servers are nice as can be.  On today's visit, our server finished her shift and changed out of her FnDwear.  On her way out, she still served a table, bussed a table, helped a party with a wheelchair-bound person, and kept a pleasant attitude about it all.  She doesn't work for tips or on commission; she just understands how to provide good service.           Four solid stars for this hot dog place, from this non-eater of hot dogs.",0.9947,0.834,0.144,0.021,0.6658854166666667

So the only reason I docked this place a star was for price (I even used my DePaul discount and our meal costs $31 for 2 sausage sandwiches, order of fries, green tomatoes, and 2 drinks) but I understand, they use high-quality ingredients. The meat quality, however, is amazing. All the sausages are super tasty and juicy. I tried the Little Piggy which was amazing. It was a pork sausage topped with Fried Oysters and condiments. AMAZING! My boyfriend had the burger-something or other which was also very good. The cocktail onions were a nice touch.

The first time we were here, we ordered 4 dogs, fries and a drink for two people.  It was awesome, and yes, completely unnecessarily gluttonous. I think we got the turdoggin,  the lamb keema, a beef curry dawg and a corn dog. The lamb keema I thought was the best of the bunch, YUM!! It was like a gyro in a bun. The second time we were here was during the filming of ""Bizarre Foods"" with Andrew Zimmern.  Not only did we see Rick Moonen and Kevin Pang here talking and hanging out  with Andrew, but our backsides were also filmed for that episode.  Awesome.  Oh and a group of us got to enjoy a whole buncha dogs and the truffle fries were introduced to us for the first time. Waffle fries tossed in truffle oil with truffle shavings?? Hell yes, please!!  I tried the Foss Hog, a sweet pork link served with bacon, maple aioli and a fried egg and it was freaking delicious. The fried egg was soooo rich and decadent against the sweet aioli and savory pork. We also tried the cheese head and the dirty dawg.  So, the last time we came was about a year ago. This time we got the ""Belly Up"" and the ""Boar'n to be Wild"".  Both were good (as expected).  The Belly Up had some kick to the sausage and the macerated grapes and dill added a nice freshness to the dog and helped cut the richness of the piece of fried pork belly on the top of the dog.  The Boar'n to be Wild was a milder dog, with the fixin's on top which reminded me of something that 's totally escaping me right now. It was tasty though. We'd heard that the bun production had now been outsourced to a local bakery, I think to Labriola. Now, I LOVED how the brioche style bun before was delicately fluffy with a perfectly crisp outside and a soft buttery inside . Sad to say, no more.  Now the bread is heartier, with a significant crusty layer, which makes the dog a little harder to eat. The meat to bread composition has been thrown off, and I'm not a fan. The dogs and the toppings are still tasty though, hence the 4 stars.  I'd definitely still come back, but I hope they'll fix the bun situation soon!!",0.9958,0.753,0.184,0.063,0.5190178571428572

I ordered the Turdoggin, after a painstaking decision between that, the N'awlins Dog, and one of the Iron Dawg competitors, whose name escapes me.  I should have stuck with my sausage rule that pork is generally best.  But I didn't, and opted for the Turdoggin.  The sausage was a slightly weird consistency for me and had a faint metallic taste, reminiscent of liver.  No good.  The casing was also pretty tough and was difficult to bite through.  The duck confit was not confit-ed enough for me: it was cold and not particularly tender.  I will say that I was crazy about the bun they used.  Buttery and delicious.  Unfortunately, the bun should not be the high point of a gourmet hot dog.       Now, the truffle fries.  I may have mentioned once or twice that I love fries.  Little known fact about me: I have a jar of truffle salt that I may or may not eat out of my palm on a near daily basis.  Clearly these puppies should have been the things that dreams were made of.  But they weren't.  The fries were hot and crisp, and I love me a waffle fry, but they seriously lacked on truffle flavor.  How, you ask, is that possible when these things are coated in truffle butter, truffle oil and truffle salt?  I'm not sure either.  I just know they weren't.  For regular fries they were good, but at $4.95 - I want my truffleness.     There are a lot of dogs that sound tasty so I'm certainly willing to give this place another go, especially because the wait time was minimal compared to Hot Dougs (not that I mind the wait there.  See Hot Dougs review).  Plus, I want to give the truffle fries another whirl, as I'm hoping I just got a less than truffley batch.  Don't disappoint me again Franks N Dawgs.",0.9955,0.766,0.174,0.06,0.6787711301044637

Another minus: If you order a number of items, it'll probably run you over $20-25 bones ... personally again, I think it's worth every bit - but others might feel no hotdog is worth this.  I think they are, but would be much more so if the place was decked out better.",0.9758,0.821,0.165,0.015,0.45935672514619874

2011-05-25,4.0,"There's really nothing like some well-executed encased meat. And truth be told, Franks 'N' Dawgs definitely executes well. After reading many reviews, seeing the ""Hot on Yelp"" spotlight, and Bizarre Foods episode, my foodie friend and I hopped over to FnD one brisk evening...a half-hour before they closed [730PM???!?!!] Looking at the menu, one might be intimidated by costs, cuz I know I was when I snuck a peek before making the drive. $2.50 for the most basic dawg?? $17.95 for the most pricey?? Geez, Louise. Can one really justify dishing out that many pennies on some encased meat? In short, yes... I didn't do it on this visit but I suggest you try it during yours, ask what the Dawg Flight is for that day. It's $15 for three different dawgs. I can easily justify $5/dawg...and you'll more than likely be more than full. On this visit, I ordered the Truffle Mac n Cheese, Da Ringer, Chili Cheese Fries, and Triple Truffle Fries. I'll being with the encased meats... In general, the dogs are not hugged by your typical bun. It reminds me of sandwich bread, though it's actually a lobster roll. A bit unorthodox, but it's a change that I welcome with open arms. Well done, FnD. The truffle mac n cheese dawg would've been perfect if not for the bread crumbs. I know that bread crumbs commonly top off regular mac n cheese, but it's a bit excess, in my stomach's opinion, since this thing is wrapped in a buttered lobster roll. Da Ringer was legit. The shallot marmalade adds soooooo much to what would be a regularly ""good"" dog. Pass on the chili cheese fries, it isn't very good. The chili just doesn't deliver. The triple truffle fries, on the other hand, are forreal. Order this bad boy. One of the best things that I like about FnD is the food running system. After you order, you get to choose from the Wall of Shame; celebs who have made quite a name of themselves. They've got all of the greats: Rodman, Tyson, Palin, Kim Kardashian, and so on.

2011-05-14,4.0,"If you're looking for a ""normal"" hot dog you won't find it here. The bread is no ordinary hot dog bun, but DELICIOUS and withstands the weight of all the schizoness piled on. They're shooting for a ""gourmet"" hot dog folks, which I know doesn't sit well with you die hard Chicago-style enthusiasts. Don't get me wrong I AM IN LOVE WITH CHICAGO-STYLE. So if that's what, a classic Chicago, I won't go to Franks N Dawgs, plain and simple. First off, when you enter, enter through the brick-walled hallway on the side lined with that green rug NOT the front. Order THEN seat yourself. There was a little confusion with how to order because there's a sign to ""seat yourself"" but we eventually figured it out. Pick the table marker of the celebrity you either think needs rehab the most or IQ you question on a daily basis (they use these 'celebrity' table markers in place of using #s). We picked Sarah Palin in light of the recent Common being invited by Obama to a poetry shindig at the White House chaos. The Governator was by far my favorite of the 3 we ordered (Austrian pork & Swiss cheese sausage, savory apple compote, glazed cranberries, white wine mustard sauce & chives). The boyfriend, the breakfast lover, enjoyed the Brunch Dog (pork loin breakfast sausage with Cobb smoked bacon, fried egg & drizzled with maple mayo). And it's only fitting with the bitterness from the last Superbowl to eat a Cheese Head, right? (Bratwurst sausage, caramelized onions, grilled portabella, smoked gouda & chives). The sausages are made in-house and if there's anything similar between Franks N Dawgs and other Chicago hot dog places, you don't NEED the ketchup to enjoy anything. You'll just butcher the taste experience. BUT if you must, do so with the fries. The ketchup also isn't a typical bottle of Heinz, one is jalapeno-infused, the other is chiptole-infused. What I will knock though is the amount of fries you get in one order. Granted they are Triple Truffle Fries, but I could have ordered plain waffle fries and brought my own truffle oils or salts from home to avoid paying $4.95 for a dinky handful. As a comparison to Hot Doug's, you just can't do it. This place is more of the Kuma's of hot dog joints. But I will say is that this place is much more convenient to get to, only a few blocks from the Armitage brown line stop, without the hour wait.

The menu is a little overwhelming - not because there is a ton to chose from, but because everything sounds so interesting - it's hard to decide. So we asked the gentleman at the register, who turned out to be the owner, Alexander (I'll get to how great he is later).  He recommended we split the dawg flight, and add one more full dawg on. The flight that day included the Black Sheep, Turdoggin & China Town Duck - to be honest, none of which I would have ordered had I not felt adventorus - but ALL of which I loved! Naturally, we upgraded the fries that come in the flight to truffle (delish) - and we added on the Truffle Mac & Cheese dawg. We split everything and there was not one thing I ate that I didn't enjoy. The Black Sheep probably ended up being my favorite - great flavor with the pear slaw on top of the lamb sausege.

I shared some of the food with my family and they enjoyed the bun, as did I.  It was unique, buttery, and tasty. The Black Sheep, a lamb sausage, was good, with onion slaw being a bit strong, but I'm not sure what ingredient was worth the price?  Perhaps $7 would have been more reasonable, but if all of the ingredients were fresh and higher end, I suppose that is what you pay for.  A good experience, nonetheless. The Belly Up was another pricey one, with only a small sliver of pork belly, but it was good.  Definitely worth a try and a good use of flavors. I also ordered the Triple Truffle Fries for $5, which were tasty, but the portions were small and I expected more of the oil to drip off the waffle fries.  I also expected more visible herbs, but maybe it wasn't mixed up as well or they skimped off all of the ingredients.

I got the Spoiled Brat when they told me they didn't have the Kimchi dog; I only found out later by dropping some eaves that they make their own kimchi, so that's pretty cool.  The brat itself was tasty, but the casing was a bit rubbery and didn't snap off like a good sausage should.  The condiments they put on were delicious, and matched up really well, but I wish there had been JUST a teensy bit more.  The bun itself was delicious as well, but it just didn't hold the dog as well as a traditional bun would have; it was a little clunky. All that aside, I was very impressed with their drink selection (Gale's Root Beer was tasty and unique) and the staff were all obviously friendly and enjoyed what they were doing, so I really can't bitch too much.  Overall, definitely worth a visit, but I'm looking forward to trying Hot Doug's and comparing in the near future.",0.9954,0.743,0.246,0.011,0.5874358974358974

Lots of the items are made-in-house and others are sourced or made in collaboration with another top quality food purveyor [such as those to-die-for buns]. Where do I start with recommendations here. The sides are a meal to themselves with the clear winner for the night being the 'Triple Truffle Fries' [yukon gold waffle cut fries, truffle oil, truffle butter, truffle salt &amp; freshly chopped herbs] crispy crunchy salty fried goodness. Someone requested that I make them the 'Brussel Sprouts Salad' [shaved brussel sprouts, blood orange oil, lemon zest, toasted pistachios, dill &amp; parmesan cheese] I think next time they come over I am going to just buy some from Franks'n'Dawgs there is no way anyone could top it. And then we come to the 'Lyonnaise Fries' [hand cut fries, braised pig cheek, arugula, poached egg &; a dijon mustard vinaigrette] are you kidding me - so good - they are worth the trip alone. I think you if want to take the guess-work out of it order the 'Dawg Flight', it is a sausage sampler [Chef's selection of 3 house made sausage sandwiches &amp; fries] who could resist that offer. One of our vegetarian friends said that the 'FU' [marinated tofu with grilled eggplant relish, caramelized portabellas, Italian salsa verde & chèvre] was some of the best tofu they had ever eaten.

The items with chef hats next to them are sausages that are made in house (pretty cool), then there is a charity hot dog item where a $1 of each sale goes to a specific charity (also pretty cool), and then there is a ""Iron Dawg"" section that consists of 2 dogs that were created by 2 staff members that are competing against each other based on sales for that item (cool and fun).

I walked in the ""front door"" (this, folks, is where America lags behind other countries in edu-ma-cation -- I did NOT read the instructions to walk down the alley to the ""entrance"". Duh). I did not do my research, as I was assaulted by a menu with too many choices and not enough time.  The register-dude, sensing my dazed confusion asks (quite politely, I might add, and in an Aussie accent, which further confused me), ""First time here?""  Sheepishly, I respond, ""Ayup.""  He excitedly runs down the menu, informing me that they do make their own sausages in-house, and those sandwiches are denoted by chef's hats on the menu. That did not further filter it down, and, using his spidey-sense offers, ""Our most popular is the Brunch Dog."" Pork loin breakfast sausage with Cobb smoked bacon, fried egg & drizzled with maple mayo. They had me at ""pork....""  So, I ordered my brunch dog, with a small fries, and a small drink (note: refills are available...small drink will suit you just fine). And, I select Hassselhoff as my order indicator (if you dine in, in order to match you up to your order, you select from the 'celebrity wall of disdain' -- Lilo, Nick Nolte, Pee Wee Herman, Sarah Palin, The Brady Bunch -- and stick the placard on your table. They will find you, believe me).  The wait's not too long...of course, the joint is not terribly busy on a Wednesday afternoon at 1PM. Waiting at my table, I notice other patrons' food around me -- the Lyonnaise fries look interesting, the truffle mac-n-cheese smells pretty darn good.  Then I get my sandwich -- The Brunch (unch unch unch) Dog (og og og) (echo echo echo...hello hello hello? Manny Moto moto moto). It looks good. Very good, in fact, topped with a fried egg, chunks of bacon strewn throughout, good hefty drizzle of maple mayo. First bite -- messy. The pork loin sausage is pork-y (one critique -- season that bad boy before putting it into the casing, and possibly while cooking it), meat-y, but a bit underwhelming had it been alone on a bun. The bacon ""chunks"" (more like bits) are bacon-y goodness and quite tasty, lending a nice crunchy, fatty, unctuous texture. Fried egg? Lovely (NEEDS SEASONING). The surprise was the maple mayo -- who'd have thunk maple and mayonnaise as a sauce? I could've used more as a dipping sauce. And, I love the bun! Unique shape. Holds ingredients well. And.....wait for it....flat-bottomed, so your whole sandwich doesn't just roll over. Brilliant.  The fries. Good, not great. Mostly underwhelming. Why, you might ask? BECAUSE THEY NEEDED SEASONING (getting a sense of a theme here?). However, they have these two ketchup mash-ups, one with jalapeno and the other with chipotle, that were fantastic. Why didn't I get one of the other , specialty fry dishes (i.e., truffled or lyonnaise)? At $5 and $7 respectively, it was a bit more expensive than I would've like to pay for fries, and there's quite a bit -- more a dish to share than for one.  I know, I know, 4 stars. I DO like FnD, but I do want to go back and try some other sandwiches, and maybe those lyonnaise fries.

Given the time I've been waiting to experience Franks 'N' Dawgs, I had to go all-out on the menu when I ordered. I starved myself for a good 24 hours to give me enough stomach space to try more items. Okay, not really, I just eat a lot, so don't judge me when I tell you what I had. Here it is: Brunch Dog: Pork loin breakfast sausage with Cobb smoked bacon, fried egg & drizzled with maple mayo -This was definitely my favorite dog of the three. The combination of the running yolk and the sweet maple mayo are truly a Heavenly duo. The maple mayo is very sweet and gives a very unique taste to any dog I've ever had. The pork loin breakfast sausage is thick and flavorful, almost has a pinch of spicy taste to it. Overall, my favorite, insane. Rockin' Ricotta: Kielbasa sausage, white bean puree, rapini, ricotta salata & red pepper flakes - My second favorite of the three dogs. The kielbasa, right off the bat, was smoking with flavor. You can see the juice squeeze out as you bite into it; I was licking my fingers clean of the juice, it had that much flavor to it. The white bean puree was surprisingly very very good, and with the rapini on top they mixed well. The addition of ricotta and pepper flakes leveled out what was a very very good sausage dog. Burger Dawg: House ground patty with cheddar, pickle, pickled onions, spicy ketchup & cherry tomatoes - My third favorite of the three. Not to say it was bad, but it was the least amazing of these three masterpieces. Tasted exactly as I'd expected, the ground patty was very thick, smothered with cheddar. Not much to say, it was a burger in dog form, but great nonetheless. Truffle Mac N' Cheese: Parmesan béchamel sauce, white truffle oil, brioche bread crumbs & thyme -Truly amazing. I couldn't have imagined a better side dish than the truffle mac n' cheese. the bechamel sauce and bread crumbs really star for the flavor. I can't really describe how good this was, truly truly great. Tripple Truffle Fries: Yukon Gold waffle cut fries, truffle oil, truffle butter, truffle salt & freshly chopped herbs - The oil makes these fries. You can taste the difference of how they're cooked. A fairly small portion which was a little upsetting, but it tastes GREAT, and especially with the jalepeno ketchup they supply. A pinch of spice with the flavor of the oil turned out great. And lastly, for my beverage, I had the Gale's Root Beer. It's apparently made in Chicago, which makes it that much better to support a Chicago-made product. But this was the most unique, and BEST, root beer I've ever had. Gale's root beer is root beer with cinnamon, ginger, and vanilla flavoring. Need I say more? Just try it! Overall, it easily lived up to my expectations, and exceeded. The service was phenomenal, even the cashier stopped us for a minute of funny conversation and gave great suggestions. After our meal, I stopped back at the counter to shake his hand and throw in a $10 tip, yes, $10, I appreciated it that much. The dogs can be pricey at about $7 a piece, but very worth it.",0.9989,0.736,0.199,0.065,0.49350363756613763

2011-03-25,4.0,"I thought the sausages here were excellent, even if they do distinguish between the sausages made on the premises (chef hat to the left side of the sandwich name) with sausages they ship in.  I had their Spicy Yucatan, which is a Achiote pork sausage, habernero pickled red onions, sliced avacado, and queso quesadilla cheese on a New-England style lobster roll bun (I am automatically predisposed to liking a place more for using this type of bun).  Given my low-carb diet, I ordered this sans the bun (cried a bit inside).  However, my friends thought the bun was unique and buttery, but one of my friends still preferred a regular hot dog bun.  Overall, the sausage I had was flavorful and rich in taste, but not overwhelmingly oily.  The garnishes provided a nice balance, especially the cheese and avacados.  My main complaint was that the sausage on its own was a bit small, especially at it's $9 price tag.  Most people could easily eat two of these, which makes this place very pricey for lunch.  However, I would probably come back again for their waffle truffle fries (which I had ONE of today), as those tasted really good (and I am a sucker for waffle fries).  4 stars, no more and no less.

2011-03-22,5.0,"Dear Hot Doug's. You know I love you and always will, so please forgive me and the review I'm about to write.   Holy encased meat bonanza, Batman!!!! I think I'm in love. With a Bratwurst. Frank's 'N' Dawgs is the bomb. This place is a Green Bay Packer fan's wet dream. The menu is filled with Hot Dogs, Brats, and every sausage imaginable. This is a sausage fest that I can actually enjoy.     I was about to tell you about the beautiful retro, Art-Deco interior, but really, who gives a shit. Frank's 'N' Dawgs is all about comfort food and lots of it. This is not your average Hot Dog joint. There's nothing wrong with ordering a $2.00 Vienna beef with all the toppings, but if you are looking for a typical Chicago style hot dog, this is not the place for you.     The menu listed at least twenty different items. I narrowed it down to two. I went with the Cheese head and a Chili Cheese dog. The Cheese head is a Brat served with Caramelized onions, mushrooms0 and cheese. It was delicious. The Chili-Cheese dog was loaded to the nines with every topping imaginable. I enjoyed it, but the Cheese head was the star of the show. Two things really stand out about Frank's 'N' Dawgs. The first thing is the size of the sandwiches. They are on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. They're huge and loaded with toppings. The other thing that makes Frank's 'N' Dawgs exceptional is the bread they use. Their sandwiches are served on buttered, New England lobster rolls. The closest thing I can think of to describe the rolls, is they have the taste and consistency of Garlic bread. Trust me, it works well.     My bottom line on Frank's 'N' Dawgs is truly delicious. A great concept, delicious food and wonderful people makes this encased meat extravaganza a must visit for the sausage lover. I haven't been this impressed by a joint in a long time. I can't wait to go back.",0.9971,0.776,0.206,0.018,0.6441696375519905
2011-03-21,5.0,"With such a temperate name such as ""Franks 'n' Dawgs"", you would expect that sort of banality you'd get at some suburban hot dog stand, whose only lure is ""we sell Vienna Beef dogs!"" and offers up undersized meat on dry buns.  If that is what you are hoping for, chum, I can direct you to any number of establishments in Vernon Hills or Rolling Meadows.  However, THIS is no mere hot dog stand. This is what happens when trained chefs take the idea to the next level.  About 20 different sandwiches await you - all of them with such delicious descriptions it was near impossible to choose. Since I am a sucker for anything with the word ""spicy"" in the title, I chose the Spicy Yucatan, which is a Pork & achiote sausage (made in house!), avocado, pickled habanero red onion, queso quesadilla cheese, deep fried tortilla strips & cilantro.  My only complaint was that if there was any habanero or spice in this, I didn't detect it.  However, while everything was delicious, the thing that put it over the top for me was the slightly charred New England lobster roll.   Its been so long since I have had a lobster roll that it didnt occur to me what it was until later in the evening. But this bun is what pretzel rolls did for burgers.  Thick, dense, almost Texas toast-like bread that holds up against any juicy ingredient.  It is used in New England primarily for the lobster roll sandwich, which is a messy, dreamy delight of lobster chunks, herbed mayo and celery.  So you know this bread can stand up to anything.  However, just when I thought things could not get better, my beet salad arrived. Folks, even if you are a hater of the encased meat product, you need to come here for this. It is hands down the most incredible beet salad I have ever had.  Roasted red & golden beets, arugula, pickled red onions, orange marmalade, champagne vinaigrette & chevre?  Oh man, I would eat this every day if I could.   Throw in a cute interior, with a super charming Aussie (who is perhaps the owner?  Not sure, but I loved his passion and enthusiasm about all of the items on the menu) and prompt service?  I am officially a fan!",0.9812,0.869,0.103,0.027,0.523144233027954

There is definitely enough choices on the menu that you're bound to at least find something you'll like, or are willing to try.  Every dog has a unique name.  I chose the Reuben Pulaski and a large fries, but almost went with the Krazy Kimchi or the Governator.  Even at 3:00 on a Saturday the place was busy but we didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes in line.  After chatting with the fellow Aussie behind the counter, I was given the Cate Blanchett magnetic portrait and found my way to the booth. No less than 5 minutes later and my dog was in front of me begging to be inhaled.  The buns are incredibly tasty and you definitely get a larger than normal dog.  The dogs are juicy and everything tastes fresh.  The fries are some of the better fries I've had in a while, but far from the best.  I didn't try the Triple Truffle Fries, but will consider it the next time I'm thinking of going to Franks 'n' Dawgs. The prices are a little more than your typical Chi-town dog but you are also getting a unique product so it's somewhat understandable.  You have the option, if you're hungry enough, to order the Dawg Flight, which has 3 dogs chosen as a sampler by the chef, but be prepared to fork out $15. Everything ranges in the $4-10 range. While I would definitely go back again, it remains to be proven if this can stack up to Hot Doug's.  I feel like a few (dozen) more trips are necessary to fully make the decision.  One place that is worthy of a stop when in the area, just make sure to bring an appetite.",0.989,0.883,0.104,0.013,0.5726282761166483

The place is generally so busy you need to line up in an alleyway which isn't as bad as it sounds. Its covered and they have the menu in the alleyway so you can pick what you want while you wait. When I was there we tried the Triple Truffle Fries (which are the exact same as you can get in the Trump Hotel but about half of the price), the Spicy Carnita, the Brunch Dog and the Krazy Kimchi. The spicy carnita had a very tasty sausage in it with a great bun but the spicy pumkin puree doesnt really work and I scraped that off the sausage.  The Krazy Kimchi was very nice and one of the best dogs on the menu. The Brunch dog was my personal favourite which bearing in mind all the various types of hot dogs they have, is probably one of the more traditional hot dogs that they have.

In terms of idea, Franks gets an A for effort, but a D for nice try.  The food here looks great, gourmet ingredients and probably the best buns I've had in Chicago. Unfortunately the sausages themselves just don't deliver on taste. How can you serve me an exotic sausage with truffle oil and various gourmet spices and have it taste bland? So, so sad.  If you're in the neighborhood, stop by, but this is not worth a special trip for.

The regular fries were nothing special.  My review is really 2 1/2 because they have Fresca at the soda fountain.  My two star rating is based on two things. The wrong kind of bun/bread can ruin any concoction. The bun they use is the same bun they use to make a clam role. You know, the one that looks like a Folded piece of Bread. I have struggled to keep every sausage bun from falling apart. The bun at Hot Doug's is superior.  If you want good truffle fries, Try Burger Bar down the street. THOSE are truffle fries. These are just OK and overpriced. Save the calories and order an extra sausage instead of fries.

I tried the Kim chi dog and that one may be my favorite, however the govenator was amazing as well. I started with the Yucatan because of my addiction to habeneros, awesome!

After demolishing the first round we all decided that we needed more. As we heaped praise upon Alex we told him that we were all fine dining servers. He brought us out the best baked beans that I have ever had made with root beer and had a nice spice to them. He also brought out a beet, arugula and goat cheese salad that I loved even thought I hate all those items alone. The Brussels spout slaw is also tasty and unique. Simply put a must hit .

They had 24 types of dogs from classic to Iron Dawg winners, global, dessert, etc. with additions like pork belly. Sides include truffled mac & cheese and truffle fries. For dessert you can get macarons from Vanille Patisserie. * Krazy Kimchi ($8.75): their handcrafted beef sausage is topped with beef braised short rib (braised 5 hours, tastes okay, needs more marinade, not that tender), thin slices of turnip (nice, added sweetness), wild rice bits (too hard, weird), big pieces of napa cabbage kimchi (the standard kind), and fresh basil. The beef sausage was beefy and juicy but very salty. The bun did get soggy, but I liked how it was golden, light, sweet, and tender - like French toast. It actually looked like French toast. The sausage was piled too high to lift and eat. Wonderful bun (I would buy/eat it separately) but everything else disappointed. * Triple truffle fries, waffle style were tender inside, slightly crispy outside, covered in oil, very salty The interior has brick walls and booths, resembling a diner.

Very impressed with the service.  The guys behind the counter are so helpful and polite.  This place is pretty pricey.  My bill was a little over $13, but I will definitely come back here again because of their service and creativity with their food.",0.9892,0.783,0.195,0.021,0.5604993386243385
2011-01-22,5.0,"Awesome.   It's inevitable to make comparisons with Hot Doug's.  I'll say this: the buns here (which aren't actually buns), beat Hot Doug's--it's actually a THICK buttery toast sliced down the middle.  So does the lack of long lines.  Parking is less convenient, however.  Expect to spend a little more for a hot dog and sides though, $10+.  However, these are pretty hefty dogs. Service here is fantastic.  The guy at the cash register (the owner?) is super friendly and very willing to explain the menu to you.  He also recognized me on my second visit, which gets extra points.  Their changing menu has plenty of interesting categories and themes, including an Iron Chef challenge, a charity dog, and certain items only available on certain days. The atmosphere is clever, with celebrity tiles handed to you to identify your order and urban photography and artwork on the walls.  Lots of red, like a hot dog joint should be.  Fits into the Lincoln Park scene pretty well. I like judging places by their fries, and I gotta say their fries are some of the best I've had, a really nice brown crisp, but still retains the softness that fries should have.  Reminds me of Demon Dogs, kinda (tear).  The ""grown-up"" special ketchup goes great with the fries too. I've tried about 6 of their dogs, but the best dog I've had is the Brunch Dog.  Never seen an egg between two buns before (ho ho!), but it works super well.  The maple mayo is exquisite! Adds a breakfast syrup taste to the combination. The owner (I think) came out to talk to us after we finished, and you can tell he just loves his job.  That's ALWAYS something I love seeing.  He told us about starting up several months ago and how tough it was dealing with former ""It's the Beef"" customers coming by, but explaining how he's really enjoying earning confidence from the community.

They are waffle fries (the very, very best type of fry, period) in all their truffle glory. (Fri-Sun only, just FYI).

In addition to the charm of the gracious staff, the celebrity table-identifying cards, the Iron Chef-style menu matchups, the mystery corn dog, and the charity sausage are all nice touches.  I love a place with some character. And the food is great, too.  This last time I ordered one of the Iron Chef sandwiches:  a spicy pork sausage with jalapeno-pickled onions, sliced avocado, a few tortilla strips, and some type of cheese which I can't remember.  Absolutely delicious.  Previously I had enjoyed the Cheese Head (a sheboygan brat with grilled onions and portabellos and smoked gouda) but there remain so many intriguing sausages to try on future visits (such as the N'awlins the Lamb Keema).   On my second visit, I couldn't resist the mystery corn dog, but I cheated a little by asking whether I was allowed to know what the selection was that day or I simply had to take a blind risk.  I was informed that it would always be a brat, polish, or andouille.  I was rooting hard for the polish, but it turned out to be andouille.  The sausage itself was decent, but I didn't care for the polenta breading; perhaps my corn-dog tastes are more pedestrian than my overall encased-meat adventurousness. The fries are excellent, excellent.  The slaw is very good, although slightly over-carroty for my taste (it also contains golden raisins, which one can easily eat around if one has hangups about fruit in one's food).  We wanted to try the brussels sprout salad but were informed that they sold out for the day before 1pm.  Please increase the brussels sprouts order so that we can enjoy next time!  But as a consolation, the owner/manager gave us tips on how to make it at home.

Each of the cooks wears their fun chef uniforms and truly take pride in their jobs--it shows.  I love that on their website you can suggest your ideas of a future dawg.  If you win they give you a $75 gift card and a dollar for each hot dog sold!  If I could change anything about Franks 'n Dawgs it'd be the location since it's not too easy to get to without a car.  On another note, it may be a good thing being that these hot dogs are...hot dogs...and addictive.  After all, FnD is in the most appropriate city possible since Chicago is home to the hot dog!",0.9879,0.847,0.128,0.025,0.5130555555555556
2010-11-21,5.0,"Best hot dog I've ever had. You must note, this is NOT a traditional Chicago hot dog joint.  In fact, you can't even get a classic Chicago-style dog (well, maybe you can ask for one, but it isn't on the menu).  If Charlie Trotter opened a hot dog joint, this would be it. The buns are awesome: they look like little cozies made of french toast, and stand up perfectly on their own.  They taste delicious, but don't overpower the dog or the other condiments. The two dogs that we tried were both excellent: many obscure and upscale-sounding ingredients that somehow blend into a perfect party in your mouth.  I had the ""Chicagoesque"" and I would not hesitate to order it again, after I've tried all the other ones that are tempting me! The cheese fries were excellent and gooey, and the ""Ketchipotle"" ketchup was awesome!  I'm going to have to see if I can find that at World Market. Aside from the wondrous collection of hot dogs, made from various ciritters, they also have a selection of ""Junior Dogs"" for kids, and a couple of impressive looking desserts.  Also, a yummy-sounding mac-and-cheese that I'll have to try someday. The staff was uniformly friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic.  They seemed to genuinely enjoy seeing people come in for a bite.  They give you your choice of laminated celebrity photos to take to your table after you order and pay, so that the servers can find you to bring your food when it's ready.  She choose Johnny Depp before I had a chance to ask for Da Coach. Being a total cheapskate, It's rare for me to give five stars to a place that costs $20 for lunch for two.  But Franks 'N' Dawgs is worth it.

2010-11-10,3.0,"One line summary : Fundamentally this is a good place, however, the main problem with it (among some glaring flaws) is that it doesn't make the concept of the gourmet hot dog its own and lack of individuality hampers these creative chefs more than any limitation to a certain form of food (more on this later). Assuming it has no competitors I would still find some pros and cons. The pros are solidly there, the management is very good, there is good patter, attention to detail in service, and a good conveying of the concept. I fundamentally believe that the chefs can produce a quality product. Similarly the bun is exceptional and the truffle fries are exceptional - especially the fry part (more on this). These pros should be experienced, and yes I would go back for the truffle fries. However I do have some issues with the concept itself - it borrows too much at times and at other times how it borrows is confusing. Case in point - The ""Iron Chef"" competition supposedly pits two chefs creations against each other. However, and this is a big however for foodies, this is not really a well structured, let alone a faithful  competition. Simply you don't get to see what the guest chefs can do since they use different ""main ingredients"" and thus the intrigue is lost. Similar things can be said about the incorporation of stars within the theme, the reinvention of the Chicago dog, and a few minor issues.  A more major problem is the disconnect in the notes of the hot dogs/sausages and their toppings.  This major flaw means a few things - first and most importantly that irrespective of the quality of the ingredients, or the care in producing those ingredients, a ""sandwich"" is produced that seems like it might as well be a salad with an afterthought of meat. Ironically, this is apparent in contrast to the Chicago hot dog whose ""dragged through the garden approach"" produces a cohesive melding of meat and vegetables lacking here. Second, the main premise ""the best handcrafted gourmet hot dogs and sausages bar none"" fails when you dissect the sandwich. Taste the encased meats by themselves and at times (not all the time) you will find them bland, unremarkable, and not as expected. This becomes readily apparent when comparing it to what should be its competition - Paulina Meat Market (among dozens of other local shops). The sausages and dogs should be able to stand on their own in all their naked glory.  Third, lets talk about the two common sides the fries and the beans. Those fries, no not the truffle fries, the regular fries that supposedly come out of the same kitchen as those truffle fries. To be kind they are limp, and unevenly seasoned. They are remarkable but not in a good way. Yet in the beans we find the real crux of the problem with the business - a lack of cohesion and focus on a vision. The beans have variety, they are somewhat exotic, and they contain good amounts of bacon/pork - yet they miss the mark because the flavors do not come together. The varied ingredients are too varied and make it difficult to gauge when the varieties of beans are all cooked right at the same time, thus complicating a dish by adding risks that do not pay off here (though they could if executed differently). Similarly the BBQ flavors lack the finesse that a visiting southerner would expect, and the pork products though plentiful do not have the vibrancy and clarity of porky bacon goodness that should be there.  Fourth and lastly, irrespective of if the product is done by famous chefs, irrespective of if it uses good quality ingredients (which is inherently subjective since the issue is if the ingredient is used well not what it is), irrespective of if the inside is slightly upscale - the final product isn't as good as Hot Dougs. What perhaps is more disconcerting is that Frank N' Dawgs seems to just copy Hot Dougs with a variation reminiscent to ""Coming to America's"" parody of McDonalds, MacDonalds. Like Dougs they forecast the dogs, Like Dougs, they incorporate stardom and naming parodies, Like Dougs they focus on turning encased meats into a shrine. Honestly it is the little things that make it seem contrived in a way and unoriginal. And yes, there is abundant room for competition and innovation. How do you think the Chicago dog survived? How about the (Hawaii) Puka dog? or the (Detroit) Coney Island dog? Simply you don't have to copy to make something great.  (Wikipedia it if you are not convinced  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho…  ).  That said it really was decent if discombobulated and not as finessed as it should have been. However despite all of this I do think that Joe Dorian is an incredible asset that even Doug would approve of - I believe the issue isn't skills, but the awkwardness which stems from Alexander Brunacci's challenge. Similarly Alexander Brunacci is charming, persuasive, patient, and willing to refine his product.   I look forward to it coming into its own - Alex embrace your food geek.",0.9957,0.839,0.111,0.05,0.5223439407814409

If you're like me and looking for something more than an oscar-meyer wiener on a bun, please go and experience Franks. I caution though to not fall into the trap of looking at the menu as ""dogs,"" but truly gourmet dishes. The first thing I noticed inside of Franks was the friendly staff (especially Chef Doren) and inviting decor. The menu is extensive and fascinating. You can choose from classic dawgs, dawgs gone wild, dawgs gone global, or haute dawgs. Some of the meats are prepared in house, and noted on the menu, while others are bought locally but in consultation with Franks. You can't go wrong either way, all the meats I'm sure are fantastic. For my meal I choose a duck based ""dawg"" served with pineapple chutney, carrots, cilantro and other flavors I can't remember. Erica prefers simpler dogs and opted for the Cheese Heade: Sheboygan, caramelized onions, grilled portabellos &amp; smoked gouda. We ordered a side of cheesy fries for good measure.  The food quality here is the real deal. Chef Doren is clearly talented and chooses to display this on buns instead of plates. It's a great concept and well executed. With a paito and BYOB I can see this being a great date place, and something to return to often with such a diverse menu. The pricing could turn some people off ($20 for two dogs and fries), but comparable to similar venues and par the course.

I could taste each individual element in the Foss as well as they way they mingled together in my mouth. The cobb smoked bacon on the Foss was some of the best bacon I've ever had. The Keema was authentic, perfectly cooked, and so flavorful with the cool cucumber salad sauce (a.k.a. raitha) being perfect for a warm summer day. It is pretty expensive, even for a gourmet hot dog.

The day we went, space was limited, because they were filming a new show on the new Cooking Channel, starring one of the contestants from the Food Channels ""The Next Food Network Star"", I can't remember the name of the show, but it will be on this fall. To the food..... I had the Dirty Dog, which was a heart attack disguised as encased meat, but boy was it worth it. The Andouille with dirty rice, hush puppies & cherry tomato relish were awesome, I had to slow down my pace of eating because I was enjoying it so much and wanted to make sure I could taste each ingredient! HA! My second dog was the Lamb Keema Dog (Lamb, English peas, cucumber salad, pearl onions & Socca), I thought of it as a gyros disguised at a hot dog. I immediately noticed that there were peas on the hot dog and I was a little iffy on this topping when I saw it, but after one bite, all my worries went away, delicious. I also tried a bite of my friends truffle fries, wow were they good. If I didn't feel sorry for my arteries, I would have definitely ran up to the counter and ordered myself a side.  Now for those of you who do not believe in paying a premium for a gourmet hot dog, then this is not the place for you, but if you are up to at least try something new once, then you must come here. I had my 2 dogs and a medium drink and it came out to be a little over $16, but since I do not eat here on a regular basis, it was worth every penny and you better believe I will be coming back!",0.9884,0.783,0.153,0.064,0.5097620097620097
2010-08-17,3.0,I'm a huge fan of Hot Doug's although on this visit he was unfortunately closed for vacation.  We visited Franks instead to get our hot dog fix.  The hot dog was good but nothing great.  The bun was really good but it rich and dominated the taste of the hot dog.  I think it was lightly buttered.  Service was nice and friendly.  The prices are way too high.  Give me a break.   I think Franks is decent although it not in the same league as Hot Doug's.  Not even close.,0.9419,0.732,0.209,0.058,0.675392156862745

We were greeted by a super friendly cashier who gave us some recommendations, let us take our time to review the giant, mouth-watering menu, and then let us choose which celebrity we'd like to use as our table number. (We chose Conan. Love you Coco!) The only thing I was not super impressed with was the corn dog. I actually didn't really like it at all since the breading fell off the (was it a bratwurst?) mystery sausage too easily and the skin of the sausage in the center was too strong. Keep it simple with the classics, guys. I did LOVE the overall gourmet feel of this place and everything else I tried. The other sausages were heavenly and oh so delicious. I need another moment of silence for those waffle truffle fries, though.  Oh man.  I had the beef curry dog with was freshly made and super flavorful.

2010-08-04,3.0,"I have to admit that I was excited when I heard about this place so I raced on over at 3pm on a rainy Wednesday and found myself looking at their menu that had fancy ingredients. That's the fad right? Take something simple and add super expensive ingredients to give it that ""on steroids"" kind of feel to it. Me and my buddies ordered the Foss Hog (the one with the egg), dirty dog (andouille with rice), and bloody mary dog (i dunno what this one was but it wasn't that good).  Foss hog was super salty. The egg is always a good touch but I think I might be getting sick of everyone putting an egg on it to reel me in to buy... cause it always works... you bastards. The sausage was SUPER salty to the point where my chili cheese fries tasted bland. I probably won't get this one again purely cause it still feel like i have a block of salt in my mouth.  Dirty dog was exactly the way I expected. The rice doesn't work on a hot dog... it makes it too mushy and it takes away from the flavor of the whole thing and makes it taste more like a burrito. Bloody Mary dog... i dunno. the bread was too much. it's like this tiny sausage (that's what she said) in this giant bun. had olives (i think) and other crap in it... not very good for me but I can see how other people could like it. I'd give this place a try again and order something else but i have to say, i'm disappointed. It really did remind of the equivalent of kuma's corner - big giant dogs with crazy toppings that in the end makes your food taste like a mixture of everything. FnD is to Kumas as Hot Dougs is to DMK. If you haven't tried DMK burgers, check it out... it made kuma's obsolete in my mind.  Sorry guys but I wanted to really like you but I can't just yet.

2010-07-21,3.0,"Quick review: good to very good, but not as good as Hot Dougs.* More in depth review: I've eaten at FnD about 6 or 7 times now, so I think I've gotten a pretty good idea what this place is about, So, I'll break it down for you like this: Buns: this is the one category where FnD beats every other dog place in town.  These are lightly griddled brioche buns, almost like unsweetened French toast.  Really unbelievable, and the best part of these dogs.  I'd make a visit here just for a plain dog on these wonderful buns. The Sausages:  FnD has made a big deal of distinguishing itself from Hot Dougs because its sausages are made in-house.  However, I don't care where they're made, so long as they taste good, and I've found the sausages to be a mixed bag.  Some have been excellent: especially the Veal Percik.  Others have been flat out gross.  I sampled the mystery corn dog, and the sausage casing was so thick that it wouldn't break off.  As a result, every bite ended with a flaccid piece of dead skin hanging over the edge of the dog.  Not appealing at all. Toppings/Combos: again, a mixed bag.  Some I loved.  The veil percik is the best I've had at FnD, and on par with some of Hot Doug's best.  Unfortunately it's not a permanent member of the menu.  Others, just meh.  It seems like a lot of the varieties rely upon some form of pickled vegetable.  I'm not against pickling per se, but it does tend to overwhelm the flavors in some of the dogs.  Hot Dougs may seem like a hodge podge, but there's really a method to the madness that is pure genius.  I've probably been to HD's about a 100 times.  You could amputate a couple of my fingers on one hand, and I could still count the number of times I had something that was less than great at HD's. Fries: Pretty good, but every time I've gone they've had a different variety so it's tough to gauge.  Nothing to blow you out of the park though.  Best fries in the city are still at Suzies. Service: Has been excellent until my last visit.  I got there Saturday afternoon, and the line was short (only two small groups in front of me).  However, it took nearly a half an hour to get my order in and get the sausage to my table.  I'll chalk this up to an anomaly though.  Shit happens at every restaurant, and the service has otherwise been stellar.  Also, I've never had to deal with any Hot Doug-esque lines...so that's a huge plus.  The fact that you can consistently get one of these gourmet sausages, within about 10 minutes, is truly great. So that's it.  I definitly would recommend making a trip for any sausage connoisseur  * I know it's probably not fair to compare FnD to Hot Dougs, but the comparisons are inevitable, and provide a great bench mark for reviewing.",0.9983,0.741,0.202,0.057,0.5764060846560848

No line at all... Entrance is actually on the side... Unique and it helps for the flow of the place. Seemed promising though if a place is really just that good I would of expected some kind of line after being open this long. I think that says something..  Anyways here is what we got for food: Cheese Head: Seemingly normal brat with gouda, carmelized onions, and portabella mushrooms. I remember thinking and saying there that I can make this at home. Nothing special or remarkable to me. It was just ok. N'awlins: Who dat there gonna be really good? Well this actually was pretty good. I liked the andouille sausage, the shrimp, and the other fixings. It would be better though with something other than just a mustard ketchup though. Definitely something I'd get again. Fries/Truple truffle fries: Fries were fine.. Nothing special... Truffle fries... omg,,, you get such a small amount of those fries. They also didn't taste any special. Maybe they need to amp up the use of the truffle butter, salt, and oil. I can't pinpoint it, but these fries were just not special at all especially for the price.

My wife actually went with the Hoss Dog which was a pork sausage with bacon, maple mayo, and a fried egg on top. It was outstanding. I went with one of their local options the Tur-Doggin. This turkey dog is topped with duck confit and a picked carrot relish. It too was outstanding. We also had the cheese fries which were ok, but not as interesting as their dogs so they seem a little plain. I'm really looking forward to going back here and trying all of these amazing creations.",0.9778,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.4884920634920635

The buns were great and the fries were good. I also enjoyed the cole slaw. The Dirty Dog is Andouille with dirty rice, hush puppies and cherry tomato relish. Loved the dirty rice and cherry tomato relish but would probably order a different dog next time. The Cheese-Head looked excellent.  Service was great and this place was spotless.

And for those of you complaining about price, if you cant dish out LESS than $10 a person, you dont deserve to have these flavors dance on your palate. Go get some McNuggets. Oh. My. God. I didnt know what to expect. I mean, I know the sign says 5 Star Dining on a Bun but I was like... how much can you really do with a frickin' hot dog, you know? But its so much more than hot dogs! So of course I had a regular old hot dog to start with. That was on my first trip there. Chili dog with fries. But what a waste of such a great place. Yeah, they have the basics... but try something new! Everything so far has been awesome. ( Lemme say, the fries were UH-MAZE-ING.  So crispy- al of them... not just the little ones at the bottom.) Next time I went I got the Reuben. The sausage was amazing. The skin was crisp and the meat was sweet... it was more than just sauerkraut and  thousand island. That on the golden buttery bun...it was great. I dont even know if they have it on their menu anymore. Your loss. The next time I went... Im at North and Clybourn all the time anyway- so whats a few blocks walk? But anyway- the next time I went I got the Duffy Duck. It was duck sausage with this like... cherry foam and toasted pistachios. It was crazy. There were cherries and endives on it. I was kind of worried about that one. But it was so tasty! The duck sausage just melted in your mouth but the casing had such a nice snap to it! The foam was tart and sweet- went great with the salty pistachios and crunchy endives. It was just something Id never tried before. I didnt even know what an endive was. I feel smarter for having tried that combination of flavors.  That night I had their dessert, too. The Sweet Home Chicago. It was on those amazing buttery buns. Honestly? I liked the sausage more. But the dessert did not disappoint. Okay, the last time I went in I got the veal percik. Not my favorite (a little sweet for me) but I threw out a clean tray. The meat was great. The sausage, like with all the other was fresh and delicious. The carrot mayo was sweet- I forgot it was a carrot that added that sweetness- the toppings are great on all of these sausages though. Its like... everything lends itself to the flavor and texture. The look? Those buns... The crisssspy fries.  Next time I go, Im trying the N'Awlins Dawg. Gotta have one of everything.",0.9985,0.759,0.202,0.039,0.5345631569688173

I settled on the Lamb Keema and the Knocked Up. The Lamb was done up like a British occupation of an Indian staple, complete with mushy peas. I liked it, but like most British food, it could have used some more spice. The Knocked Up didn't have that issue. It came with grilled eggplant, goat cheese, salsa verde...lots of flavor. But the flavor of the knockwurst was completely lost. I should have asked to have the sausages switched. I shouldn't complain, though. I gobbled both with fries. Well, half of both. They're a touch bigger than I expected but not giant. The french fries were really, really good, and even stayed crisp after the bike ride home.

Anyhow, today I gave this place another try.  I opted for the ""N'awlins Dawg,"" described as Andoiulle sausage, fried okra, shrimp, and chives.  Sounds delicious, right?  Hrm.... When I opened my take out box and saw the creation in front of me, my first thought was: ""not what I expected.""  It was missing the chives first of all.  I had also imagined fried okra like my grandma made- green, slimy, and delicious with little black char spots on it.  What I saw on top instead was the JALEPENO POPPER of fried okra.  A fried casing around a perfect vegetable- more like an appetizer at Chili's than a topping on a ""haute dog."" Next were the shrimp.  Thought I'd get some yummy shrimp on top of my dog- NOT battered and fried shrimp.  Again, they screamed appitizer, not topping.  I also saw a tail on one of them and thought to myself, ""how am I to bite into this like a hotdog now?""  Am I just going to be swallowing tails?  How is my healthy heart going to handle FRIED & BREADED okra & shrimp on top of a sausage?""  It could have, and WOULD have been sooooo much better if they would have just let the toppings speak for themselves rather than FORCING them to be good by battering and frying them.  Aren't there supposed to be good chefs here? Needless to say I ate the POPPER first, leaving 1/2 of the breading behind and begging for more okra, ate the shrimp next, and by the time I got to the sausage, I was already feeling a little ill from all of the grease in my stomach.   I took a bite of the sausage, and the casing was so tough that I heard it break between my teeth.  The meat, while well spiced, was too oily and I honestly didn't think I could continue.  No, I didn't eat anymore of it, and ended up throwing my lunch and my money in the garbage.   So not only did I not get a hotdog for lunch, but I hardly got anything for lunch, and felt my body begging for something GOOD.   If you want an awesome ""haute dog"", got to HOT DOUGS!!!  They know what's up.  Don't waste your money on Pizza Hut when you live in a city that has Lou Malnati's and Pequods.

Thinking about it now, the first few bites I took were great, then as you keep eating you get all the different flavors and they just didn't go together that well. And it was too much grease, I only ate half and I felt kind of sick.  I am giving three stars because even though I didn't particularly like the dawg I got I still think that it is a decent place. The toasted buns are awesome! and worth going back for. My coworker got a jumbo dog with their Guinness mustard and grilled onions, it was great, so next time I will go with that.",0.9916,0.698,0.239,0.063,0.5717980295566502
2010-04-11,5.0,"Franks n Dawgs totally blew my mind. A friend had suggested it once it opened in his neighborhood, so we went together, my first time and his second. When you first walk in, the place is pretty small, but the pictures on the wall are cool and the booths are nice. The owner told us all about the menu, mostly homemade sausages and all homemade condiments. The hot dogs that are not homemade are from really fancy local chefs. It was hard to decide, but the cooks reminded me that we could split the dawgs to share them.  My friend got a cheesehead and a chili cheese dawg, and i had the chicken ceaser and cheese fries. We each tried all three, and they were all insane. The chicken dawg had basically a small ceaser salad on it but it wasn't weird or anything, just crunchy and delicious. It also had black garlic, which i have never tried.  Then I tried the chili cheese dawg- again, insane. The hot dog itself is what i thought was so amazing. Vienna beef is all fine and good- but this dawg was huge, skinless, and literally melted in my mouth. The chili was great- and I actually liked that it was meat and bean chili. Finally i tried the cheesehead. It was a bratwurst with cheese, grilled onions portobello mushrooms and chive onions. The flavors were PERFECT with the brat. The fries were just the icing on the cake. They were crispy, hot, and golden brown like a commercial or something. There was a homemade sauce that one of the cooks offered to me for my fries- some kind of ketchup and mustard combo which was totally delicious. My friend and I were literally wowing the entire time.  I can't imagine how busy this place is going to be once word of mouth and press gets rolling. I have already been back a second time. I remembered on my second trip that this place is now BYOB, and brought some brewskies to share with my friends.  When I have friends from out of town visiting, I will tell them to skip the chicago dogs and get the hell in this place.

I ordered the ""Mystery Corn Dog"", of which I should've been more leery of the title. It was a polenta-encased mystery sausage. The Corn-dog part was disgusting: it tasted like flavorless, fried cream of wheat around a greasy sausage. The sausage was horrendous. Crunchy (in the middle, not the outside), and a flavor of mashed meats. I assume it was a spicy veal sausage, but never got an answer. My wife got a jumbo dog, which was fine I guess. Anyway, it made me sick, and I usually have an iron stomach. It's taking a lot of will power to write this review, and not gag just thinking about it!

This place is only going to go up from here.  I agree with the other reviewers that it is a bit pricier than Hot Doug's, but I think this can be justified because of the higher rent at this location and the fact that they make most of their own sausages (the exceptions are the hot dogs and the german sausages which require a finer grind).

The corn dog batter was tasty though....  One Disturbing Thing - Didn't like that while the chubby kid behind the counter was putting fries into a costumer's order he was also eating them!!!!! WEIRD! Who does that???!!! PLEASE at least wait till after you're done serving and munch all you want- idiot! GROSS  Also didn't like that their veggie dog is not a dog at all - but just marinated tofu in a bun. I have a problem with that since it's a hot dog place and I wanted my veggie dog made into a corn dog which they obviously couldn't do... so that was also disappointing and I didn't order it-it's more like a sandwich, not a hot dog.  Overall- the concept is cute, but the menu was not appealing to us and we expected things to be more creative, homemade, thoughtfully presented, executed, etc.  So if you want a step up from a plain dog-I am sure this will work for you.

When I walked in, they told me they were closed. But they hadn't really started to put everything away so they said they'd serve me. It was between the duck/pork  or the veal sausage and the two guys behind the counter both recommended the veal with date chutney, carrot ginger mayo, and cilantro. The guy reached for the sausage, paused, and went in back and grabbed a better piece. Then seared it. They use a top-loader bun with the side crust shaved off. It's buttered and toasted like a lobster roll as the sausage cooks. I chatted with the guys. They are passionate about sausages of all kinds.  The finished product was excellent. Really good combination of savory, spicy, sweet, and texturally dominant compared to any of the other local spots. They went through 10 bakeries before settling on the bun and it was worth the effort.  There is a special concocted by a local high-end chef and each month they will have a new guest chef create a new dog.

The Spoiled Brat was great too, both sausages were cooked perfectly. It was not busy at all, so I wonder what it will be like when the line is getting crushed and there is a line out the door. The buns were more the New England style, no crust on the sides, so they are very conducive to buttering and browning the outside of the bun. This is a great idea and seems to resonate with the previous reviews. Why bother to butter and toast the inside of a bun if you are going to cover it in sauce...Franks N Dawgs are spot on with this nice touch. As for the duck dog, the only thing I would add is a touch of mayo spiced with some sriracha Rooster sauce, that would have made the dog an unhinged masterpiece.

It's '5 star dining on a bun' which  means that the expert chefs have crafted unique sausages and homemade toppings and condiments to accompany them. Still don't get it? Just imagine your favorite flavors and cuisine served up hot dog style.  One look at the menu and you'll realize that the folks at Franks and Dawgs have not limited themselves to the traditional meats and condiments that you find on a bun. They've got everything from a Chicken Caesar dog topped with creamy Caesar mayo to a Cheesehead brat piled high with portabella mushrooms and caramelized onions. I had the opportunity to try a handful of the artisan franks and each one had the perfect medley of flavors and the gourmet toppings that complemented the dogs perfectly. Other standouts included the beef curry dog topped with a crunchy Asian slaw and the to-die for mystery corn dog (aptly named for the fact that you have no idea what type of sausage you're getting). The corn dog is dipped in a polenta batter and fried to a golden perfection- the texture was like nothing I've ever tried.  While the meat and toppings would be delicious standing alone, the toasted buns they are served on take them to the next level- seriously, next level. The buns at Franks N Dawgs really deserve their own review, they are that good. They are sort of a cross between a traditional hot dog bun and Texas toast. They are browned up on the grill right next to the dogs and what results is a bun sturdy enough to handle the meat and piled high condiments but still soft and crunchy. You just need to try it to understand.  I really appreciate a restaurant that sticks to one concept and style of food and then executes it to perfection, and that's what Franks N Dawgs has done. Perfect gourmet hotdogs, scratch made toppings and hand cut fries served in a casual setting for a reasonable price. Great addition to the neighborhood.
