I was invited to a rooftop party and when I got there one half of the roof had a bunch of untucked shirt dudes drinking beer and bro hugging and the other half was filled with beautiful Indian women and a few dudes. I couldn't figure out why the bro hug dudes weren't getting busy with all those beautiful Indian women until I was told that they were actually two events sharing the roof without a divider between the events.  I was happy and relieved that I was invited to the event with the ladies! The roof is nice, no frills but functional. The drinks were decent. Good local neighborhood place.",0.9492,0.782,0.192,0.026,0.5181372549019607

She was friendly so I will give her that much, but we should have known our experience here would be sub par. After this whole ordeal we finally sat down and it took our server another 10 minutes to acknowledge us and once again he was away from his area not paying attention to what was going on. We ordered drinks and one of my friends ordered a martini, and after what seemed to be an eternity the server comes back to say ""we do not have martini glasses because there is a party of 10 people and they are all being used"" what kind of establishment runs out of glasses? Then we move on to order another drink and the serves once again comes back and says ""we are all out of it"". At this point I was just over their terrible service and moved onto food. The food was ok ( the chips for the guac were stale !) and once again the food was brought out separate when we all ordered together, (a good 15 minutes passed before we all had our food so we didn't get to eat together and once again the server gave a poor excuse"" our ticket got cut out as it printed and we could not bring out the order together.

2015-08-16,4.0,"My friend and I were looking for a roof top restaurant/bar for good food and a couple of drinks so we came across Citizen. Was a slow night which made it awesome to find parking, of course it's pay to park but were do you find free parking now a days anyway.  They had an outside stair case to get to the roof top which was convenient.  Sat at a 4 top table with chairs that were somewhat uncomfortable but manageable. Our lovely server greeted us with a drink menu and 2 food menus and took our drink order. I ordered a crown on the rocks with a splash of ginger and my friend ordered a ketel and sprite.  They came in a plastic cup instead of glass which was a bit disappointing as it was hot out and our drinks watered down fast.  10 minutes into being there our server came and took our food order. My friend and I were hesitant in getting the Mac and cheese bites because they aren't always up to par at other restaurants but when we got them they were amazing. Crunchy on the outside and creamy and stringy with cheese on the inside. I cannot say enough positive comments about them. We ordered the chicken strips, which were just regular friend chicken nothing special but delicious for the moment. The last thing we ordered were the guac and chips. I must say I might not order their guac again as it needed a bit of lemon and salt to be perfect. To conclude this review, I will be back for the Mac and cheese and with a bigger group of friends.

The reason I bring up the service is not an issue with a particular server, they are all nice people in my experience, it seems more that Citizen is not where they want to be, and it drags on your experience there as well.

2014-09-20,1.0,"I was happy to eat and drink here until I met the General Manager, Manny. My girlfriend and I arrived on the roof top bar around 8:30pm and opened a tab at the bar, which obviously entails giving them my credit card. I had a good time on the roof top and the weather was very nice. Around midnight, we were told that the bar was closing the roof top. I went to the bar to close my tab. Now prior to this, I had seen Manny, who I didn't know was the manager at the time, drinking shots of alcohol with some co-workers. This sight didn't bother me until I realized that I had to deal with him.  Now, when I went to the bar to close my tab, the bartender went looking for my card. She searched all the black books, in the normal card holder and then began to involve other staff in the search for my card. Now, I give them credit, they did really look for my card by pulling back things and using a flashlight to look on the surrounding ground areas. It became apparent that my card was lost. I understand people make mistakes because lord knows I have before and I have lost a card in the service industry. I was wiling to be peaceful about it despite the huge inconvenience it posed to me.  I asked the bar tender if I could speak to the manager on duty. That is when I had the pleasure of meeting the General Manager: Manny Navar. Manny at first ignored his bartender when she told him of the situation and how I wished to speak with him. When I say ignored, he told his bartender to talk to us. Instead, Manny made the awesome decision to drunkenly stumbled down the stairs to: LOOK FOR OUR CARD DOWNSTAIRS. Now this would be fine but WE WERE NEVER DOWNSTAIRS. So after 10 mins his red, glossy eyed, slurring word self came back up to tell us that after his great investigative work, he did not find my card.  There is where I get the pleasure of actually speaking to Manny. If you can call it speaking because the man was hammered and could barley form a coherent sentence. Manny proceeds to explain to myself and my girlfriend that the reason why my card is not at his bar is because a bartender (WHO I HAD NOT ORDERED ANY DRINKS FROM) may have put it in her pocket and walked off with MY CARD. When Manny was asked ""why would my card be in the bartenders pocket"" Manny had the great reply of "" Well maybe she thought you left."" Yes, Manny actually thought, that the people who he was currently speaking too, HAD SOME HOW LEFT THE BAR! WITHOUT PAYING! Despite the fact that WE HAD ORDER DRINKS 10 MINS before we were TOLD IT WAS CLOSING. Manny in all his wonderful drunken glory feels the need to then explain to me that ""he has been running bars for years"" and that ""mistakes happen""  Yes, Manny, mistakes do happen. But your intoxicated self is what makes this mistake worse. Not only did you not once apologize but your candor and slurred speech made you look like a fool. You made yourself look bad and unfortunately, your staff look bad. If you can drink on the job god only knows what you let your employees do. I really did have a nice evening at the Citizen Bar, but I wont be coming back and I will make sure others know of what happened.",0.985,0.816,0.119,0.065,0.5105297157622739

The pita tasted fresh, and the chicken was seasoned, though a bit on the dry side. The goat cheese melted into it some and helped moisten things up; it was almost like mayo on a sandwich, only richer. And better.

It was a nice summer day, so we were able to sit on the patio, which had a nice, fresh, urban oasis kind of vibe with green plants and umbrellas. I didn't drink but can say the iced tea left something to be desired (though, in fairness, it was likely only intended for cocktails, no to be consumed on its own. It tasted like it came from a mix). I did sample their chips and guac, which was full of onions (not a favorite for all, but I didn't mind) and had a nice citrus kick. The large tvs by the bar kind of killed things for me, but apparently televisions are less commonplace at bars in Chicago than in Boston, where they are everywhere. All in all, it's a cute place to stop at if you're in the neighborhood, which I assume is a bit off the beaten path.",0.6659,0.766,0.134,0.1,0.6313146997929607

I don't know if the B and C squad are only scheduled at lunch hour, but every time I have gone to citizen I have had the WORST service I've ever had.  It always takes forever for the wait-person to come take our order. And when he/she does they often have to come back and ask at least one person in my party what they ordered again. Or bring out the wrong thing. And this is every time I've been there. Regardless of entree, appetizer, beer or a request; at least one thing will come out wrong. And if I'm in a larger party half the dishes will come out and then we'll have to wait 5-10 minutes for the everyone else's. Then there's always the lucky chap that orders a salad and it comes out 5 minutes after everyone else has gotten theirs. Often if I need another drink, silverware, or refill I have to hunt down my server because he/she is chit chatting with other wait staff and can't be bothered to come check on the table.

2014-05-01,2.0,"I have had a rather tumultuous time at the restaurant as of late... A new head chef had entered the establishment for a few months now and certain tweaks to the menu have had a mixed reaction.  The new wings were charred more but were still flavorful... at first. A recent visit led to buffalo wings that were just bland. Experimentation has led to weekly specials including a bourbon sauce that was just OK to a garlic parmesan that was abysmal - what looked like garlic salad dressing (that did not taste the least like garlic) and large shards of parmesan melted on the wings, leaving a sticky, unwieldy mess. Other menu items like a one-off, white onion soup with raw white onions was disgusting. Some menu items are quite good, though. The seasoned fries have remained (although they were initially changed but were probably met by unsatisfactory feedback besides my own, causing them to remain the same) and the Turkey Club is still a reliable sandwich. The only good new menu item is their Shrimp Tacos, served in a soft shell (although it needn't be so moist that squeezing them causes a cascade of juice out each end). Their service is consistently good which makes this painful for me to write. If only the food was consistent and matched the quality of their service... As it stands, I'll only return if I feel like going for their fries with the club.... but I don't get the hankering very often.",0.9578,0.835,0.118,0.047,0.47402474976004383

2013-10-10,2.0,"My wife and I just moved to River North and had been wanting to try Citizen Bar after walking by numerous times. We finally got the chance to a few weekends ago, meeting up with another couple for lunch on a Saturday. In short, the atmosphere and food were fine, probably worth 3 stars, but (as it seems with many of the other reviews) the service was disappointing. In fact, I don't think I've been in a more awkward situation at a restaurant. First, the good: the outdoor seating is fantastic. The roof wasn't open when we went (I think it opens later in the afternoon/evening), but the deck is just as cool. It's a very comfortable area in which to relax with a drink. Also, they have an extensive beer list and a variety of vegetarian options, which my wife and I appreciated. I found my meal average. I ordered the bean burger and fries. Fries were good. The burger was okay, but it is very spicy. The spiciness overwhelms any other flavors. I didn't particularly mind it, but if you are not one for a spicy meal, you might want to avoid it. My wife and her friend both ordered the goat cheese pizza and seemed to enjoy it (it looked like it might be big enough to split if you wanted a light lunch). And her friend's husband order a chicken wrap, which he also seemed to enjoy. Ok, now for the bad: the service, as many have mentioned, left much to be desired. After asking the hostess at the outdoor stand for a table, she seated us at a reserved table. The reservation was scheduled start an hour and a half after we arrived, and we asked if we would have enough time to eat before the reservation began. She assured us that we would. I'm not sure why she seated us there as it appeared that there were other open tables (and there were tables open when we left, so I don't think they were all reserved too). She didn't remark upon the table being reserved or anything--I just figured this was standard practice here or something? It took awhile to put in our orders--the waitress left a long gap between taking our drink and food orders. The food seemed to come out in an average amount of time, maybe slightly longer. Anyway, here is where it gets weird: about three-quarters of the way through the meal, the hostess comes to the table to say that the reservation has arrived. We looked at her unsure of what to do, and she kind of stood there awkwardly. My wife says after a moment of silence, ""Soooo do we need to move?"" and she said, ""Yes, there should be other tables open"" and kind of awkwardly walked away, leaving us sitting there. Still not sure what to do, we all pick up our plates and silverware and drinks and water, and shuffle around for a minute until my wife spots a different table. We relocate there, sit down, and a little while later our waitress comes up and says, ""There you are!"" as if we were playing hide-and-go-seek or something, no apology, no further comment. Very weird. Like I've said, I've never been in such an awkward situation. I was confused as to why they would sit us at a table with a reservation, especially if they know that with their service, we wouldn't have been able to order, eat, and leave in an hour and a half. I was also confused why the hostess didn't direct us to another table and why she and the waitress wouldn't have helped us move. What a sight we must have been, juggling plates and silverware and glasses. Certainly, this is probably not a common occurrence here (hopefully not!), but it's maybe an indication of the general way this place is managed (especially given the general tenor of other reviews). This is my first review on Yelp, but I was so confused about the whole situation, I felt compelled to write. Overall, aside from the service issue, the whole experience was fine and my wife and I most likely would have gone back, especially for post-work drinks and appetizers. However, there are so many other places in River North, I think we'll pass on Citizen Bar. Plus, maybe I'd relive the awkwardness of that moment if I ever went back.

If you try to enter Citizen through the alley, you will be directed to the front door.  Which is what you describe here.  Thus contradicting you statement that our staff is incompetent. The staff in the alley you speak about just got done working the bar at the Taste of River North.  Many of them were neighbors and regulars that worked with us at the beer tent.  Which is awesome.  They were all having a great time and doing so in the alley behind our business, which again, is not the entrance to our business.  We don't fault our off duty staff for choosing not to work.

On a perfect Wednesday in August my friend and I decided to meet at Citizen for a couple drinks.  I went up to the rooftop which was busy.  I went to the bar and noticed that the bartenders are far more concerned with carrying conversations with the waitstaff than actually serving customers.  I finally make eye contact and ask for a beer list.  I get the beer list, but the bartender then actively ignored me.  For 5 minutes he continued talking to the waitress and ignored customers.  I walked to the other end of the bar to another bartender to get a drink.  My friend came and we got a table.  Unfortunately the waitress was the one who was chatting with the bartender.  Service was awful - we had to send another waitress to get her when we wanted another round of drinks.  We ordered mac and cheese bites, but they weren't worth the calories.

I asked if they did anything special for birthdays and she bought us and took a blueberry bomb with us. Off to a great start! Later on, we ordered well dark tequila shots. Ummm what came back was clear tequila, no salt, and it tasted like water. So either they gave us water shots with a lime or they watered down the tequila so much it lost its color. It also didn't even burn. It was horrible. We told the waitress it sucked and ordered Jose Cuervo shots. These burned a bit, but were most likely also watered down. The poor waitress was basically in charge of all the tables in the outdoor patio section, so she was running around all the time. We had to pay for all the watered down shots and they wouldn't split the check, we had to tell them how much to put on each card instead. I wish I had a better experience because it is so close to where I live, but I am not paying full price for watered down drinks! Barcito is close by and has a killer Sangria and amazing food.

2012-07-05,2.0,"I was excited about dining al fresco on a hot weekend afternoon. My expectations were immediately lowered when the bouncer demanded our ID's and tried to get my wife to throw out her bottle of water before we went in. What is this, John Barleycorn??? I guess the ID thing is okay (it is a bar after all), but It's like 3pm on a weekend afternoon, the place is dead, and dude, you serve free water. Maybe he thought we were trying to smuggle in vodka?  We didn't get to sit on the rooftop because it wasn't crowded enough for them to have that part open. Still, we sat outside on the lower level patio. The area itself is nice enough (although next to a parking lot), but THE CHAIRS ON THE PATIO ARE LIKE TORTURE DEVICES. As someone who has had back problems, I am a little extra sensitive to chairs anyway. But seriously, these chairs went well beyond uncomfortable. The chairs on the rooftop and interior were different, so if we go back we're definitely going to have to sit somewhere else.  I went ahead and sent this email to my worst enemy: ""d00d go check out the lower patio at Citizen, it's where all the coolest bros go to chill and relax!!!"" Hopefully he develops back pains in the future now as well. Food wise, it was actually pretty good. The menu is pretty small but if you can't find something decent to eat, you're not trying hard enough. The beer and drink menu was decent but not spectacular. The service was friendly and fast, although almost too fast. The waitress brought out our check before even asking if we wanted another round of drinks. Guess it's time to go....

I have been by this place a number of times, only to see it bustling on both the patio and rooftop. On Sunday, only the patio was open & the rooftop was cordoned off, but still plenty of seating. Atmosphere Felt like a club to get in: not only were we carded (fine, as a 30 year-old, I'll take that as a compliment) but I was asked to get rid of my bottle of water. Why - were they going to sell bottled water once inside? I threw it in my bag and called it a day. Seriously annoying. The patio seating is nice  - several different seating options to fit groups of any size. I will say the chairs are REALLY uncomfortable - get some cushions on those metal chairs! I could feel the metal rods tattooing themselves on my legs. After a while, I got used to it. Again, annoying. Service Our server was really friendly and super-fast. However, she was almost too-fast. She brought us our check without even asking if we wanted anything else  - so I guess we were ready to leave.  Eats Decent drink menu & the hubs was happy with the beer selection. I got an orange-y vodka cocktail & after a couple of sips, wish I hadn't just spent $8. I'll know better next time. Food is your usual bar fare: burgers, wings, wraps, and pizzas. I liked that there are specials every day of the week too. I ordered the chicken strips and was pleasantly surprised. A huge serving (definitely enough to split) & I liked that it was lightly breaded, so I didn't feel like SUCH a fatty. Really tasty BBQ sauce for dipping; asked for the Buffalo sauce on the side too. Yum.  Overall, underwhelmed. May be neat to come back here and sit on the rooftop & check out the atmosphere when more patrons are around.

Extra star for the management. Truth to the matter is, I've only been to Citizen once and couldn't have been more impressed. We were on the upstairs rooftop from around 5pm-12am. It was hot and muggy, but the atmosphere at Citizen was great. They were very accommodating to our party that took up almost half of their rooftop.  Beers were flowing and good times were had.  One of the best roof top bars I've been to. TV's were easily visible and they had no problem turning on the basketball game when we asked. No complaints when we hung our pinata either. Great downstairs patio as well with a giant communal table near the entrance. I will definitely be back. My only qualm was the limited rooftop menu. Only about 7 items, I asked if I could order from downstairs and bring it up. The waitress, who was really great all night, said if she made an exception for me then others would try the same. Well played, well played. I settled for the guacamole and although it's not difficult to make, it was very fresh and plentiful. Home made chips and big chunks of avocados. I also snacked on the seasoned fries and home made chicken fingers. Both pretty good... standard bar food but I can appreciate that the chicken fingers are made in house.  So I can't speak for when this place gets packed... which I'm sure it inevitably does once it gets warm. However, I am a fan. Seems like it'll be a good spot for after work drinks and/or a daytime drinking on the patio.   **Additionally, Jay Cutler dropped by and sat on the rooftop.",0.9973,0.707,0.244,0.049,0.6013840495547813

I've been here on numerous occasions for both lunch, dinner and happy hours as it has quite the intriguing draw for the River North crowd. It's got a nice vibe, a generally happy staff, and even some not-so-crappy weekly specials for the diner on a budget. The Good: It has a wonderful outdoor space for those warm summer days you want to bounce out early from work to grab a refreshing brew dog under the sun.  The food is generally very tasty and the drinks are not that expensive.  You could spend some serious time here if you wanted to enjoy the lazy breeze with friends and libations. The Eh: Although it's understood that they only serve bar nosh, the menu is pretty small.  It leaves much to be desired in the way of options and gets old if you are a recurring customer.  Additionally, the soups and chili are not worth the price. You'll end up paying entree price for a bowl of soup or a cup of the corn chowder only to be left completely and utterly starving. I have also had occasions where the service has been less than favorable. Especially if the outside deck is open, you might be expected to enjoy the outdoors a little more than you enjoy your beverage.

It appears you have made great strides in the last few months regarding steps of service. Also, the drinks on their summer menu are STRONG! And for less than 10 bucks, a great value in the city. The food was just alright, but I don't really think people come here for the food anyway. The reason I am giving Citizen only 3 stars relates to the last 30 minutes of our visit. After receiving our food, we had to wait another 10 minutes for our server to come around for a drink order. Things fell apart from there. The server took a while to come back with our drinks, and when we were ready for the check she was nowhere to be found. I just ended up going inside and cashing out with her.  I should say that our busser gets 5 stars from me! He was fantastic, attentive, and picked up the slack from our server.  In closing, Citizen has made improvements since my first visit.

Too bad me and my friends thought it was a good idea to stay up top when the temp dropped into the evening hours to about 48 degrees last week. I guess the sun was out in the afternoon so the nostalgia of summer had us a little confused as to what the temp would actually drop to in the evening. Heat lamps didn't help, but thanks for trying!  Decent food at a decent price ($7 pizzas on Fridays...YUMMY!)  ok - so here is what I don't like about Citizen:  We went downstairs once it got a little chilly and stalked for a table. Place was packed. We noticed a big party leaving and pounced on their table. It is now 7pm and I haven't eaten since 12 so at this point I'm about to eat my arm and pass out from the liquid snack of 3 rum and diets I've already consumed. We wiped down our own table and grabbed the menu's behind us. I mean could we have facilitated this process any faster!  The waitress blatantly ignores us. And she's not that busy, because I see her dancing and chatting with a fellow waitress. I look her dead in the face and she walks right past us. Now usually I'm pretty hardcore when it comes to customer service. Typically I would have stood uncomfortably close to this chick as if I was 2 seconds away from punching her in the face and politely said ""is there a reason why we aren't being serviced."" I feel as though fear creates results. But I was crammed in a booth between two other people and they were having a great time chatting so I didn't want to kill the mood.  Luckily I was able to flag down the waitress on the other side of the room, and she kindly helped us. She even said ""this isn't my station but what can I do for you all?"" She grabbed our drinks, food orders, even brought us some water in less than 5 minutes. I think her name was Marissa, or something with an M.

I'll start with the caveat that I haven't been here during the summer with the rooftop and deck open--that might warrant another trip. Otherwise, I see no reason to come here. I've been here three times, and every time service has been absolutely atrocious. The bar has literally had 3 or 4 people in it and it will take 10 minutes for the server to come over with menus. Totally unacceptable in my book. The music has also been SO LOUD on two occasions that I have to yell at my companion. This was on a Tuesday night and a Wednesday night with less than a dozen patrons. This is not a nightclub people--let your patrons talk to each other.  One night I wasn't very hungry so I ordered a salad. It was the smallest $9 salad I've had in my entire life. Literally ate it in 5 bites. My friend's side salad on his $8 burger was larger than my entree salad. What a joke.  So why do I give it two stars? One--the black bean hummus. Best $5 spent in my life--huge portion and so so so good. However, on my last visit (in which I only came for the hummus), I come to find out that they got rid of it. Hence the $9 tiny salad instead. Such disappointment. The other bright spots are the half-price wine bottle night--Wednesday I think, and the $4 burger night on Mondays. Very affordable.

Finally on Wednesday I blow up and tell them I'm taking my sizable business elsewhere (was willing to commit to at least $1,500 in revenue for a private party). She finally returns this email and says sorry they actually have a better offer from another group but you can have the outside lower side area for my party instead....yuk!  Bottom line in this recession I have no patience for businesses who don't respond to customers who are ready to spend money. I ended up booking my private party on the roof of the new Sports Corner.....their venue is amazing and they were great to deal with.  Fact that Citizen Bar blew their chance to land my party was a blessing in disguise as based on these other reviews the party wouldn't have been that great either way.",0.9904,0.785,0.163,0.052,0.4968181818181819

2010-08-01,4.0,"Ok.  So after I had a really bad experience here for brunch I was contacted by a different manager who was very sorry I had such an awful time of it there and he offered to make it up to us if we returned and gave it another shot.  He made good on his word so here is my new review re-do. THE RUNDOWN:  AREA/ATMOSPHERE: Great little rooftop in a chill area of the city right by Erie park and close to other spots like Japonais, Hooters, Zed, and so forth.   DRINKS: I was pleasantly surprised by how decent the mojitos were!  Good and fresh, not from some over sugared mix, well done.  My boyfriend also enjoyed his Manhattan (of which he is a very picky expert of) and his beer, Big Sky or something?   FOOD: We had the Falafel for an app and they were so good!  Would def come back just for some drinks and that alone.  Then we both had the Cadillac burger, though I was contemplating the Basil Chicken Salad.  Burger was good but a little too huge for me.  Fries were decent as well, they are of the seasoned variety but not too much to where you can't taste the fry so I like that. SERVICE: The service was much friendlier than the last time I was here and it was also much better.  However my onnnly complaint is that it was a little on the slow side with the food and that some of the food, like the falafel and fries with our burgers had turned a little on the cool side.  There was a time in the beginning when we really thought our server forgot about us and it wasn't even busy.  But, she did make up for it by being more attentive after that and other bus boys and staff there were nicer than last time as well so that's good. THE BEST PART OF IT ALL: The one thing I can't stress enough here is the value of good customer service.  Sometimes you wonder if anyone really cares about that anymore. This manager did and really did do a good job of addressing my concerns and made what seemed to be like some good changes.  So as a result of him caring, it made me care and thus return and thus would return again.  Other managers of bars and restaurants take notes please.  :)  This is the reason that there is a fourth star for this review.",0.9982,0.76,0.219,0.021,0.4951652514152513

The chicken cabbage wrap was so tasty, especially with a side of Rooster sauce, and the raw veggie noodle salad was the bees knees and at only $7 for my meal it was pretty damn cheap.

They also stopped their great $5 lunch specials which were great deals, especially in the River North neighborhood.

Their heating lamps kept it at a comfortable temp while sitting at a table/bar or standing around. Plenty of flat-panels for watching sports or Bones.  What I really give the citizen bar kudos for was their service. With a drink package, most of the time a guy is looking to pound a fair amount of drinks to get the most for their money.

There were a couple of super important looking old men in three piece suits smoking cigars. Some 40-something women, and a bunch of twenty-somethings, ranging in style from fratty, to hipster, to just plain sad. The service: We had reserved a table outside for ten people the day before. Nine of us were there and they would not let us be seated until the tenth person arrived. Note that it was 5:15 on a somewhat rainy day and the bar was not at all crowded yet. The gross looking girls at the door were so rude to us, but we ignored them and went inside to have a beer while we waited for our tenth. Finally we were seated up on the roof, and their idea of a table for ten people was two tiny four tops with ten chairs crowded around them. We made it work, but it was annoying. Around 8, about half of our party remained and the hostesses were stalking our table, rolling their eyes at the fact that we were still there, and more or less asked us to leave with their expressions. Our waitress was fine, but not incredibly attentive. My guy friend noted that she looked like a cross between Victoria Beckham and Michael Jackson, ha. The drinks: They were a little smallish, but fine. My Absolut & sodas were $7 downstairs and $8 on the rooftop (interesting that there is a price difference, no?).  The food: Ha! This was the funniest part of all. One of my friends ordered the calimari, and it was the weirdest thing I have ever seen. Instead of including the usual rings, they cut up and deep fried lemons hoping to pass them off as calimari.

The staff is great- lots of fun, attentive, great all around. The food is good- I wasn't a fan of the inflatable caprese, but the gorgonzola risotto cakes were delish. Nice, fairly cheap wine selection.  I cannot wait to go back to Citizen.

Friends' birthday party on a Friday night.  We sat inside in the loungey area at the front of the bar.  Our server was ATROCIOUS making the service slow, horrible, and rather annoying.  This place looked trendy enough that we thought they might have an inventive drink list.  When we asked our server for one, we were informed there was no drink list, but the bar could make whatever we wanted.  We then proceeded to describe what kind of drink we wanted and asked for suggestions, to which she could only come up with a French martini...  OK, I guess I'll have that if you can't think of anything else.  It was OK and my friend ordered a chocolate martini that just didn't have enough espresso taste.  We asked for a slight alteration with a little more frangelico and espresso, and for some reason that couldn't be done.   We had a big group, but I know she botched others drinks cause I saw some people send them back.  We did end up with some Stoli Blackberri and Lemonade drinks that were suggested by some of our other friends at the bar and this was quite good.  The risotto bites were pretty good but overpriced.  Our friends ordered to bruchetta and mac & cheese squares which looked delicious.  The only good thing I could say for our waitress is that she kept our tabs straight and we didn't have any mystery charges on our receipt.. Bravo to that. 2. Sunday before Memorial Day we came for a quick drink before dinner and enjoyed the nice weather outside.  I was surprise how large the rooftop and outdoor patio were - it practically tripled the space of the bar!  They were grilling something (we went to the rooftop to avoid the propane smell) and had the Stoli and Lemonade 32 oz. on special - yum!!   It was a good mix of people, although we were a little intrigued by scantily dressed ladies with furry leg warmers.  They were pretty much in swimwear just sitting around with no promotional materials.  Our curiosity was answered when they started dancing....horribly and tastelessly.  Apparently the men liked it, which obviously was the point, but it seemed a little out of place.  I dunno about you, but when I'm over my friends' houses for a little backyard BBQ I don't have half naked women shaking their rears in my face....  anyway, that's beside the point. I would go back another nice evening to experience the rooftop, but ladies beware, the deck is wooden planks.  It was hard enough to tip toe around without getting my heel stuck sober, I wouldn't even want to try after drinking a while...  Also one other thing that peeves me about Citizen is the lady in the bathroom...Ugh, I know it's personal preference but, no I don't need help turning on the faucet, grabbing soap, or a paper towel... I've been doing it since I was about 2 years old.  Furthermore, I don't want you gum, hairspray, or miscellaneous perfume, I've got my Orbit and put my own on before I came, thank you!!",0.9971,0.795,0.155,0.051,0.5438988095238095

The huge mirror behind the bar does two things: it makes the small space look bigger, and lets you look at people in every corner of the bar. The outside porch closed seemingly early, but it could have been later than I thought. My friends and I had a great spot to sit, but if I just got there, battling the people at the bar for drinks would not be fun. Sadly, I don't remember the music they were playing but I assume it was good (however it obviously wasn't worth remembering). Great location if you feel like venturing over to Rhino or Stone Lotus. I recommend as a starter place because there are better bars for later in the night. Its just very simple.",0.9851,0.694,0.244,0.062,0.4476190476190476
2006-08-29,3.0,"It's basically a nice and simple bar downtown.  It's a new place that opened up a few months ago.  I'm sure that have other additions, because there is no clutter or artwork.  There are 3 plasma screen tvs there, in which I was subject to scrutiny over cheering on my beloved Packers while they were getting their butts handed to them by the Bengals.  I'm just going to say pre-season.  Anyways, I was recently introduced a waitress that works here - thus the reason I was here at Citizen.  The bartender James is a hottie, but married.  He has a lovely Scottish (not Irish) accent.  He made some very mean drinks, and by that I mean really strong.  The outdoor patio looked nice and spacious.  There's not a big crowd, and it might be because I came on a Monday.  I'm not exactly sure I'd come again, because it's not really convenient for me.",0.9719,0.832,0.157,0.01,0.5401254082175134
2006-08-06,3.0,I went to this bar the other night and I thought it was average. The bartenders and other staff were not very friendly.  The one good thing is the big patio area although it does close at 11.  I don't really see myself running back there.,0.0142,0.877,0.062,0.061,0.3043269230769231

2006-07-09,2.0,"What is with the plastic tables and chairs and makeshift bar on the roof deck???   We stopped by Citizen bar last night and thought it was a bit overrated.   The inside is neat and pretty modern, but then you walk outside and there is cracked green plastic tables and white flimsy chairs.  They really need to invest in real tables and chairs for the patio and rooftop deck.   The place was packed, but give it a couple more weeks and I think most people will agree that it is nothing special.",0.6057,0.868,0.087,0.045,0.3443722943722944
2006-07-07,3.0,"i pass citizen bar every morning on my way to work.  finally i stopped in and was looking forward to sitting on the patio, except it the roof patio was booked and the ground level patio was full.  rats. now, i am alone having a drink after work and i like to read.  they did not have one newspaper or even a magazine behind the bar, which really is sacreligious.  i had to walk to a store to get the chicago reader [which they should have distributed there because it is a prime location].  i get back and have a seat at the bar and am finally happy, until i order. the conversation went like this... red stripe?  no.  okay, how about dos equis?  no, but we have peroni.  [to myself...that's italian, not mexican, not even spanish and peroni is really not that great.]  okay, how about chivas?  no.  really?  what's that bottle over there?  chivas.  okay, i would like that on the rocks with two limes, thanks. it was 8 bucks for a double.  i was happy about the price.   the bartenders are slow.  it took 12 minutes to get a water.  seriously, it's just tap, not fiji or something that was melted down from swiss glaciers, just tap.  the scene is just that, a scene and there is no reason for sequins on wednesday at 7pm.  however, i would go again, with my own reading material. i was a smidge disappointed that they are not open for the lunch.",0.8466,0.832,0.098,0.07,0.4362222222222223
2006-07-01,3.0,"Checked out Citizen last night. Was expecting something ultra impressive based on the line that was outside. Lots of guys in their jeans/collar top combo, lots of gals in their skirt/heels combo. Music was your usual Top 40.  Drinks were your normal drinks. Blue shaded ambience throughout. It was okay but it didn't thrill - didn't offer anything I haven't seen at any of the other night spots, except for a new location.",0.1864,0.878,0.086,0.036,0.40420110192837466
2006-06-26,4.0,"I've checked out Citizen Bar twice now in the past two weekends. It's a nice summer addition to River North. The outdoor patio, both downstairs and upstairs, is fabulous and there's tons of room to spread out. Great music too. My only complaint is that they need more bartenders- the wait for a drink takes longer than normal (some of my friends were so annoyed they left after 10 minutes!) but this is a great meeting spot to start or end your night with friends.   This bar seemed to open up at the perfect time- the beginning of summer when people crave outdoor seating and patios. It's a fun new spot (and an alternative to the usual scene at Rockit!)",0.9799,0.767,0.207,0.026,0.5815340909090908
