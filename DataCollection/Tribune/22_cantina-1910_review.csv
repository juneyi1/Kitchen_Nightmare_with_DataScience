2016-08-26,2.0,"Not surprised one bit that they closed. I called it the first time I went there and couldn't find a single traditional item on the menu, not even salsa! Considering 9/10 restraints fail you have to be really ballsy or just stupid to not offer what most people consider traditional dishes. I love food and different takes on traditional dishes. However, I have absolutely no idea why this restaurant would shoot itself in the foot by not offering traditional tacos, burritos or even salsa for heavens sake. Absolutely amazing how ignorant this decision was. I live in Andersonville and loved their Margaritas. I went there twice. However, if I could have stopped in and had just regular chicken tacos or a salsa that is recognized by pretty much every other place on earth I would have stopped in on a weekly basis, perhaps a couple times a week. What management was thinking I will never understand. Why alienate yourself in such a competitive industry! It's a good idea to offer basics and what most people around the world consider Mexican cuisine. I love how one reviewer described ""pretentious tacos to say the least"". That statement sums it up. Sometimes, it pays to keep it simple stupid. Have different options for people who want to try new things including myself, but don't try to reinvent the wheel and then let that be all you offer! That's restaurant suicide! What a shame, it was a beautiful restaurant! On a positive note, the service was good.",0.8817,0.777,0.131,0.093,0.5758563508563508
2016-08-22,1.0,"I heard Cantina 1910 is closing, with the excuse that their minimum wage workers are overpaid.  I'm not surprised they are closing based on an experience I had this summer. About a month ago, I ordered 2 tacos for carryout on a Friday night, 6:30ish, understandably a busy time - and they told me a large group just came in, likely a 45 minute wait.   I show up 45 minutes, they said they'd check.  I waited patiently, and discretely, understanding they told me of the delay.  I check in 15 minutes later, and they inform me they haven't started the order yet, reminding me that they already informed me of the delay and it would be at least another 45 minutes.  Then I decided to thank them and leave, as such a wait for 2 tacos wasn't worth it, nor was the unnecessary rudeness, blaming a waiting customer for placing a 2 taco order and expecting it to be done in under 2 hours.  Chi chi's could have done that in the 80's with waves of groups coming in. Uncle Julio's does that today all over the suburbs.  That's what big restaurants are supposed to do. But Cantina 1910 didn't fail me that night.  They taught me a valuable lesson, that I was a stupid customer.  If I was smarter, I would have biked over and back to big star or l'patron, would have gotten better tacos for half the cost.  What kind of a dumb customer was I to order carryout from them? I had been there maybe a year ago and otherwise liked their food.  But it doesn't matter how good or bad your food is - if you can't treat your customers or workers with respect and can't run a kitchen, you won't last.  Successful restaurants don't make excuses, but failing ones do.",-0.8671,0.853,0.05,0.097,0.4678571428571428

2016-08-05,4.0,"If you do nothing else, come here for the carnitas small plate. Seriously, I could have eaten about 5 orders of those on my own. The meat is perfectly cooked- crisp on the outside, but falls apart in your mouth.  Now that I've said that, on to the rest of our meal. We also had the seabass ceviche. The flavors and texture were good, but the fruit to fish ratio seemed a bit high (some bites felt more like a fruit salsa than a ceviche). For our entrees, I ordered the pan roasted fish (which was an ivory char tonight) and the husband ordered the chicken breast. I'm really glad I went with the pan roasted fish- the mole verde was amazing- vibrant in terms of color and flavor, and the roasted vegetables on the side were a good complement. The husband's chicken was good- the sauce (some kind of mole) and the chicken chicharron were the highlights, and added strong flavor and texture to a well-cooked but plain chicken breast. We also ordered drinks. I had the tequila daisy, which was refreshing and slightly different from a typical margarita (but also not too far out there). He had the 1910 margarita, which was really good- I probably would order that next time or any time I needed a margarita.  Finally, dessert. Honestly, I would recommend coming here just for drinks and desserts based on the quality of both. I had the tres leches cake- which was DELICIOUS, especially if you're a coffee lover. All the components came together beautifully, and the chocolate creme on top made it feel extra indulgent. Husband had the churro, which was crisp and cinnamon-sugary, and not at all greasy. The caramel on the side was top notch.  I can't forget to mention the service- if you have questions on any of the dishes, they're very well educated on the menu and can describe exactly what you're getting and make recommendations.",0.9975,0.794,0.203,0.004,0.6595739348370927
2016-08-04,4.0,"What's up with these yelp reviews for this place? Why would you go to a Mexican fine dining restaurant to eat Tacos and Guac when the entire neighborhood is littered with taco restaurants on every block? We had a coursed out meal, 1 ceviche, 2 small plates (which were not small and more like entree sized), 2 entrees and 2 desserts for $60 before tax and tip last night (Tuesday) and they were ALL fantastic. The dishes were creative and well executed and made with high quality, fresh ingredients. I never had any good experience with expensive fancy Mexican food before, but Cantina 1910 hit it out of the park! Scott, our server, was attentive and was very knowledgeable and helpful describing the dishes to us while we ordered. Will be back! ============ Sea Bass Ceviche - Very fresh and smart combination of flavors of marinated sea bass, blackberries, peaches, ginger, serrano, jocoque. The serrano might be too spicy for the general audience, but I appreciated the heat level. To perfect the dish, I would prefer to dial down the acidity and cut the sea bass a little larger pieces to make the bass the star of the dish. Banana Leaf Fish 'N' Papas - this was a barramundi fish topped with tomato tamarind and hominy based sauce, wrapped and steamed inside a banana leaf. The sauce was very complimentary and  fried purple potatoes were absolutely delicious perfection. The only disappointment was how small this entree was (fish was probably about 3 oz max) and the potatoes was about a 1/2 of a potato.  Pan roasted fish with mole fresca sauce, fried masa dumplings and roasted seasonal vegetables was my favorite entree. The fish was cooked to perfection, not over done and with crisp skin. The masa dumplings and roasted veggies were very complimentary in taste and texture. Scallops Divorciados small plate - excellent pan fried scallops with delicious, bright flavored sauces on a bed of sweet corn.  Pork belly small plate - very tender and well fat-rendered pork belly. The meat was crisp on the outside and the inside was juicy and tender.  Tres Leches de Cafe - not too sweet and a smooth blend of coffee, chocolate, and caramel flavors. This was probably the only tres leches cake I have ever liked. The Cherry Raspado - was very refreshing. The condensed milk with tart cherry shaved ice and rubarb toppings go really well together.",0.9978,0.77,0.2,0.03,0.5537835775335774

So sweet and attentive, just for them I wanted to like his place.  I started with the night with the Tipsy Gringa cocktail and sad to say this was the only drink I ordered as it was so sweet I was unable to force it down.  We ordered the Quesos Fundido for our appetizer and it was basically Tostitos chip dip heated and served with store bought flour tortillas. Quesos is one of my absolute favorite dishes and I was super stoked to try their twist on it. Bad choice, took two bites and let it sit.  Lastly we tried one of every kind of meat taco on the menu; the Carne Asada was the most edible and had a decent flavor. The rest were over sauced and over spiced to the point you only tasted that one spice. The side was an incredibly over cooked bowl of black beans with what I assume was shredded pork.  I was truly sad to have been so disappointed by what looks from the outside to be a gorgeous new spot in Andersonville so neat us, but oh well.

2016-07-30,3.0,"So I made a Yelp account specifically to review Cantina 1910. I'm an Andersonville local and was really excited to try this spot (despite mixed reviews). I rounded up to a 3 even though it's really a 2.5. Mainly because I think this place has promise and am hoping mgmt is willing to make some tweaks to improve. Came here for dinner on a Friday night. Immediately notice the beautiful interior/lighting/decor. They did a great job with this. Our server was very attentive and friendly. We paid $7 for chips and a salsa sampler/trio, which though they were good should not have had to be paid for. They should do a complimentary chips and house salsa and give people the option of paying for the salsa trio or guacamole. I had their classic margarita which was not very good. It was boozy but didn't hide that well, it just tasted like cheap tequila and margarita mix. I had the taco flight with 3 tacos and a side of rice. I got 2 carne asada and 1 al pastor, both good, not great. No major problems just not very flavorful and small. The sides are very bizarre here, you can get vegetables or lentils, beans, or rice but none of them combined. I get that this place is more of a ""new"" Mexican spot i.e. not traditional but the rice was just not good enough to be stand alone. It was bland and had a salsa on top seemingly in an attempt to mask that. I found myself really wanting some beans and rice which in a ""Mexican"" restaurant is a pretty sad state of affairs.

We should have listened. It was not busy at all when we went in and we had reservations, but the bad service started at the bar and continued throughout the desert. The good- nothing anyone at our table ate was great. Every item on the menu seems to add one or two ""mystery"" ingredients to try and make it different. None of them worked and everyone in our group felt the same way.  Guacamole- tons of garlic and radishes-why? Throughout the meal, the comments on the food alternated between bland, strange combinations or one flavor that overpowered everything. Too many flavors that don't go together and no balance in the cooking.  As for the service, the waitress was nice enough but when a restaurant is half full, it shouldn't take 90 minutes from order to entree. Funny but true story- she was told it was someone in our groups birthday and the first thing she said was ""we don't do anything for birthdays"". We laughed, but we also weren't saying it to try and get anything free- we were just answering her question as to what brought us out to dinner. Then, to try and make up for it in a strange way, she put a candle in a desert THAT WAS ORDERED BY A DIFFERENT PERSON. Told the birthday boy to blow out the candle, and then hand the desert over to the person that actually ordered it. Wtf?  All the food was ordered at the same time, and some in the group had the small plate, large plate special, but I don't care what the circumstances are it should never take 90 minutes from the time you order your food to the time you get your entree. With mexican food? Most of it tasted like it was made in advance and we couldn't figure out any item that we ordered that could take more than 10 minutes to make from scratch. When you finally get asked what desert you want while a staff member comes by and says "" are you still here? wow you have been here a long time"", you know it is bad.  The space looks great the location is ideal. The food is bad and the service is equally terrible. I can't wait to see what opens in this space next when competent management and real kitchen staff get their hands on this place.

2016-07-18,2.0,"My girlfriends and I came in over the weekend for dinner for the first time as a start to our Girl's Night Out. Before deciding on Cantina 1910 we looked the place up and saw a vast amount of mixed reviews. Personally I am the kind of foodie that is not influenced by bad reviews, I like to see things for myself. I had high expectations when looking over their website and reviewing their menu. The location looked great, the menu seemed to set a certain bar, and then there is the neighborhood hype. First I have to commend the service, I saw that many reviewers were commenting on the terrible service. Personally, I thought that Saturday Night's service was pretty impeccable. Our waitress seemed to know the menu very well and threw in all her recommendations and loved her. Our waitress was very attentive, along with the other table staff - our water pitcher was always full and our waters / soda / margaritas were often refilled without having to ask. The service was great!  When it came to the food we were all very underwhelmed. We were a group of 5 and we had different picks from the menu. We started with 2 Appetizers, The Guacamole and The Queso Fondido. Everyone enjoyed the the Queso Fondido, the girls killed the tortillas before finishing the dish. FYI extra tortillas are $2 - one of my girlfriends joked about how normally $2 would get you like 50 tortillas from any store and it was something to laugh about. The Guacamole was really bland... the chips were not salted and there was no salt or pepper or hot sauce on the table. I hate to say it but that dish had little to no taste, we ended up using the salt from our margaritas and sprinkled it on the Guacamole until we wrestled enough courage to ask for salt. Everyone at the table enjoyed the Ceviche(s). We also had a couple Taco Flights on the table and unfortunately these tacos were something to talk about and not in a good way. These tacos didn't stand out, again the flavors were underwhelming, and each one just seemed to be missing something. I have to ask, who eats tacos without any sauce!? It would have been a nice option to have. These tacos were pretty pretentious to say the least and not in a good way. In addition to the many tacos on our table, I had the Eggplant Milanesa. This dish was OK and just OK - After throwing on some salt, and by some I mean a lot! The eggplant itself was good, the wheatberries were an interesting addition, and the apple guajillo was very bland... I was hoping for a wow moment, again maybe the option of a sauce - hot - mild - anything would have helped this dish out. I have to say that after this dish I was pretty much Done. My girlfriends on the other hand were still looking for more. Dessert was tasty and interesting. My girlfriends went with the Flan Classico and the Jalapeno Con Crema. I was told the Flan was great, that plate was quick to go first. The Jalapeno Con Crema got mixed reviews, 2 found it interesting and 1 found it to be a weird mix of flavors.  Overall for what we paid I probably wouldn't come back now that I pretty much know what to expect. I'm no stranger to fine pretentious food, pretentious food that sends your taste buds through a flavor story that makes you want more. Cantina 1910 had a hit or two but not enough to draw my back in, I hate to say it but I have to agree with the crowd of similar reviews.

The day was beautiful and we got a table that was by the doors that opened onto their outdoor dining area (we wanted the benefits of sitting outside yet not be directly in the sun). The drinks look very interesting. They have a few types of Bloody Mary's. I had the 1910, which is the spiciest. My friend had the same as well as the green Bloody Mary. He said it was nice and refreshing. To share, we ordered the cinnamon bun and sweet bread for the table. Both were delicious! The sweet bread was like a bun made with chocolate bits in it. The cinnamon bun was really good, and of the two, I would get that one again. For my meal, I had the chorizo and cheese omelette. It was good but nothing spectacular. It came with potatoes and the portion was decent. The place was a little dead (we were here from noon to about 1:30 pm) but that was probably due to it being a beautiful day on a holiday weekend.

I have to share how laughable this place was, I didn't expect much based on reading how unwelcome this place was to the neighborhood when it opened, but I read they have a good rooftop so figured I'll check it out with some friends in town. So we are seated and inquire about the rooftop, we are told it is closed so they let the bees up there develop their honeycombs, so they can be more farm to table. I am Latino and enjoy honey, but not sure how this makes sense as far as working it into recipes or drinks? Fine we have a seat on the lower level patio, so I'm very decisive and order a margarita as my friends go to the bathroom from our waitress and the trainee with her. They come back and my brother and my friend order their drinks (Michelada and Modelo).  So the Modelo comes right away and 20 minutes later the michelada and magarita arrive. We're told the orders were mixed up, granted its maybe a quarter full and two people took our order. Fine but two other tables seated after us were served before us. Then the best part, was the table next to us had an even more laughable experience. They ordered two rose flutes or something similar.  We watch the waiter bring it out and tip the tray over and spill both drinks on himself. Then PROCEED to approach the table with his trainee behind him. Talk about AWKWARD...Its like hey man let your trainee take the blame and come back with two new drinks and without a soaked shirt.  Anyways that was some comedic relief in visiting this place and it was very satisfying hearing that table say amongst themselves 'Hey we don't have to eat here if you guys don't want to'. I don't live in the area, but tried to give this place a chance before such classic establishments as Hopleaf.  I must say however it was fulfilling to confirm all the negative press I read about this place in person.

We requested another table which visibly annoyed the Maitre'd. At our insistence she gave us a table away from the corner.

For the main meal, I had the pork, my partner the short rib. There were 2 styles of cooked pork on the plate. Roasted and crispy and round diamond cuts of pork loin which the waiter said were cooked in a special way to make the pork moist and tender. When cutting into them, they were tough and still pink. When this was presented to the waiter and brought to the chefs' attention, the reply was they cooked it medium well. Undercooked in my opinion. The short rib was overlooked and dry and powdery. Not sure about the rest of the wait staff but I was under the impression that our waiter was not familiar with the food in the restaurant.

Despite there being over a dozen open tables, we were sat right next to the service station up against the wall. After scraping crusted guacamole off our own table, we ordered two bloody marys, where the main 'selling point' is the house-made pickled vegetables they come with. Our waitress brought us two tall glasses of tomato juice with vodka and limes, explaining they were out of all the garnishes/pickles. Frustrating, but hey, I've worked in the industry and running out of things happens, so we shrugged it off. Unfortunately it only got worse. The highlight of the meal was a plain churro. A soggy breakfast burrito was a distant runner up, but the real disappointment was the steak and eggs dish. At first it looked like they had forgotten the steak, as it just looked like a fried egg on a bed of black beans. Underneath the egg were four minuscule slices of steak, not even 4 ounces of meat. It was laughable when the waitress then handed us a steak knife, as if it was needed. One tip to the restaurant: list the ounces of steak on the menu so folks know just how little meat they are actually getting for that price. When asked how our meals were, we were honest - they were not good and we were displeased by our experience. Nothing was done to alleviate this beyond a half-hearted apology. We later called to speak with the manager who apologized but then proceeded to say 'well none of that was your server's fault"" which completely misses the point: We weren't blaming the server. It was the service in general that we received from start to finish that is to blame here.  Fifty dollars and two upset stomachs later, it's safe to say we will not return to this restaurant, despite the waitress bringing us a dinner menu and encouraging us to try what they're 'really good at', the tacos.",-0.8191,0.805,0.087,0.108,0.4789115646258503

After years of wondering what would happen to T's, the restaurant was a welcome addition to the SoFo stretch of Andersonville.  However after going on a double-date there I was left underwhelmed. There were numerous issues but primarily the food wasn't tasty enough, service wasn't good enough, and the cost was just a touch too pricey.  As we waited for our table I made my way to the bar, and waited, and waited, and waited a little bit longer to order a beer. After eventually getting the beer and getting seated we ordered a bunch of dishes to share. The only standouts were the oxtail and the chips and the salsa.  The homemade chips were good and wonderfully salty, but 8 bucks for a modest portion of chips and salsa seems a bit pricey. Most of the dishes were underwhelming including the pastor tacos, fish tacos, and cemitas.  Service began attentive but then just inexplicably disappeared half-way through the dinner.  To end the meal the Tres Leche cake was good, but overall Cantina 1910 didn't leave the strongest impression. For a group of 4 splitting a bunch of dishes the total came out to $120 with tip, but again, nothing was really great on the menu. The only thing I'd order would be the oxtail, chips and salsa (if you can get over the price point) and the tres leche.

Unfortunately, there was no hostess stand or anyone really paying attention to the door so the 3 of us stood around awkwardly trying to make eye contact with a server. One told us he would ""relocate"" one patron at a table that we'd be able to sit at and then a second server walked us over to a 4-top in the corner.  After about 5 minutes, we got water and menus.

The chicken dish was just as bland and in no way worth the $24 price tag. Even the cocktails, which used to be excellent, have gone south. The special 1910 margarita tasted mostly of sugar. And they served the smallest pour of wine I've ever seen. But the most disappointing part of the evening was the sourpuss host. This place used to have really friendly, welcoming hosts. Maybe they still do on some nights. But the burly, bearded guy at the door couldn't be bothered to even crack a smile when he gruffly seated us and barely glanced up from his phone as we left.

Once we were seated, the service was okay.  Our server seemed a bit nonexistent, so we had to wait if we needed more water or to put in orders, etc. I got the classic margarita with the vanilla rhubarb flavor, and it was my favorite part.  Fairly reasonably priced, too.  The food was really hit or miss; the guacamole was good (unique ingredients, but it worked) and the ceviche was decent (though apparently it's supposed to come with house-made saltines that we didn't get, and didn't realize until we had eaten all the ceviche). The tacos were disappointing.  I got the short rib and the turkey carnitas.  Whenever I took a bit all I tasted was tortilla.  I tried the meat on its own and it was very flavorful, but as part of the taco I couldn't get that taste, or the taste of any other ingredients.   I liked that they had different sized plates so you could get what you wanted.  Our group shared the two appetizer plates, and I then I got two orders of tacos (they come with two each), which was perfect for me, while others got full meals (like the cemita or the seafood), and also split tacos.  So it has that going for it, that you can order meal sized based on how hungry you are.",0.9485,0.865,0.089,0.046,0.562962962962963

Perfect portion sizes for each section of the menu and an amazing drink menu (created by an Aviary vet- no need to say more) ALL at a very reasonable price point.  We went with a party of six for Mothers Day brunch. Contrary to other reviews, our service was great, however I will note that the place was not very full (probably due to our late 2:30 brunch reservation). Our waitress was kind and informative, breaking down the menu for us. The food menu consists of three main sections: pequeno, mediano, grande. I loved this because you have options. Not everybody eats the same amount of food and nobody wants to pay more for food they wont eat. As our waitress explained, even some of the small choices could be a meal (exemplified by the two in our party who ordered and thoroughly enjoyed the burrito which is under ""pequeno""). We decided to order the Molletes to share along with a few red, as well as green, bloody marys.  The Molletes ($6) came out on fresh, house baked bread (they have an in-house pastry chef; there is a small pastries section on the menu). Topped with black beans, salsa and queso fresco, these were almost like a Mexican Bruschetta. Everybody enjoyed them and was left wanting more. The soft, fresh homemade bread was the highlight for me.  We then ordered entrées. 2 ordered from the pequeno section (burritos: $9 each) 2 ordered from the mediano section (huevos motulenos $13 and chilaquiles $12) and 2 ordered from the grande section (bistec y frigoles charros: $16 each). Everybody reported great things about their meals. Not one person was unsatisfied. I had the $16 steak & beans which comes with grass-fed 21 day aged steak in a large skillet full of pork beans topped with a fried egg. The steak was a little bland and overcooked for the medium rare i asked for (the other steak & beans order was cooked to preference), however the meat was still tender and with a little salt&pepper the dish was phenomenal. Great flavor and great size.  As for drinks, our party was very impressed. The bloody marys were considered some of the best they have had, along with the cocktails. OVERALL, it was a great experience. You have to know what you are getting walking in here. This is not some hole-in-the wall taqueria. Its authentic Mexican done with a high quality, modern approach.

Something that apparently consistently happens based upon previous reviews and people waiting around our table to be seated. We saw our waiter twice and had to order everything at once expecting it to take longer. Both our drink and food orders were messed up in some way. And finally the check took another 15 to get.

2016-04-29,3.0,"So finally tried this place last night, here are the highlights: Good: 1. Beautiful and comfortable space 2. Interesting tasty menu and cocktails 3. Fresh ingredients and good spins on traditional mexican cuisine Bad: 1. Chips that came w/ guac were slightly stale and guac on the salty side 2. A whole drink (1 of the trio from Rosario) was spilled on my shirt and lap and no attempt at recompense was made Do not come here expecting traditional mexican food. This is a new take on the cuisine, and not bad if you understand that from the get-go.  I ordered the Steak Añejado, cooked perfectly to medium and that catsup/mole sauce that came with it complement it well.  My friend had the Puerco en Cazuela, good blend of carnitas, pork loin, chorizo, and red beans. No complaints with the main dishes. The La Fuega cocktail (tequila w/ spicy ginger) was my favorite and would definitely try it again. It is hot and spicy balanced w/ a bit of sweetness.   My second cocktail was the Rosario, a trio assortment of made up of a reposado tequila, a mezcal, and a campari cocktail.  This is served like a flight of 3 small-champagne style/flute glasses which are delicate and easy to topple over.  Topple over they did, straight onto my lap as the server was placing them on the table.  After a few apologies and several napkins, a replacement drink was brought and the night went on. I'm not one to cause a bunch of fuzz, so I assumed that they would at least discount the drink, or the meal in general for the mishap.  Instead I was presented with a full bill.  Yes this place is pricey, and clearly I don't mind the price tag, that's why I came to eat here, so it isn't about the money.  But if you want to keep your customers happy, especially after you spill a tequila all over them (uBer driver complained of the smell the whole ride home), you'd think that a simple recompense of a free dessert, a discount to something would make up for it.  But not even an attempt was made, to me this is a clear indication of how this establishment values (or lack thereof) their customers. Anyway, drink spill incident aside, the food is very good.  I've heard good things about their brunch menu, I'll return to try that and see how that experience goes.",0.9951,0.794,0.171,0.035,0.537791201047015

My first two visits were in the middle of winter and as it was dead. Even then it was a little slow, but today was just ridiculous. First, we waited a half hour to be seated even though we could see lots of empty tables. I finally walked up to the clueless hostess and asked if there was any reason we couldn't sit at the table right in front of us and she replied no, so we sat down. We ordered drinks and coffee right away. The waiter was cute and friendly, but seemed a little overwhelmed. The mimosas were too heavy on the orange juice, but the coffee was delicious.  We ordered two courses and then proceeded to wait almost an hour at which point everything showed up at once. The food was actually quite tasty, but honestly we wished we would've just went to Bongo Room across the street. Their food is tasty too and their service like clockwork.  This restaurant was only at about half capacity and they couldn't handle the business.

2016-04-13,4.0,"I was predisposed to hate this place, but I got a great vegetarian meal at a reasonable price.  I've learned to avoid farm-to-table establishments like Cantina 1910.  The concept sounds right up my alley. I appreciate that people care more about where their food comes from. But I've come to find that farm-to-table usually means a focus on meat, which means they usually don't offer anything substantial to vegetarians like me, except for some boring salad. They also tend to be overpriced with small portions and big pretensions.  That's what I expected from Cantina 1910. When I read that the executive chef quit soon after the place opened it only helped to solidify my suspicions. But my wife really wanted to try it, so I caved.  We went for lunch. We shared the veggie gorditas, potato taco, guacamole, chips and salsa, side of black beans, iced tea, and chocolate chip cookies. I would order all of it again. The portions were generous, and the bill for two with tip came to $40. I was satisfied and didn't feel like I had been robbed. That's a win in my book. Not that there isn't room for improvement.  The potato filling for the taco and gordita was fine, but I would like to see other vegetarian filling options such as mushrooms, cheese, or beans. I also wish they offered a salad without meat (they do for dinner but not for lunch).  They make a chili tamale, which sounds great, but because the masa is made with chicken stock it's not for me. They have a hot sauce that they call ""diablo,"" but it seemed a little bland to me. To be fair, I like a lot more spice than most.  My wife's biggest beef was with the chairs. They are a bit narrow for someone with a wider than average backside.  These are nitpicky details, of course (take a hint, petty Yelpers), because I'll definitely be back.  Their beans are outstanding, and their guac, while pretty basic, is very fresh and you get a lot for $7. Also, we had a very helpful waitperson. He had only been working there for three days so he couldn't answer our questions off the top of his head, but he was able to provide an adequate answer once he could grab a more seasoned colleague to fill him in.",0.9972,0.763,0.195,0.042,0.5569686411149825

2016-03-20,1.0,"Short version: Flavorless food, bad drinks, terrible service. My wife and I tend to stick to the same types of places for our Brunch options (Bongo Room, Tweet, etc.)  so we wanted to venture out a bit more. So we ditched the line at the Bongo Room and went to their kitty-corner neighbor Cantina 1910. We checked out the menu just in case it was too pretentious and it passed the test (although the sheep's milk ricotta was pushing it).  When we entered we were immediately impressed by the beautiful decor. Unfortunately we stood at the empty host podium for a few minutes not knowing whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait to be seated. After enough ""awkward time"" had passed we were seated at a broken table. We graciously asked to be seated at a regular table, which was nice of us to offer ourselves. The host said she would put something under it to hold it upright but never returned to do so. Moving on to the food we ordered the fried chicken and churros, the milenesa de pollo, and the sopa de tortilla. I also ordered a tequila daisy cocktail. After our order was taken our waiter decided to ghost us and not once did he ask if we were okay or inform us on the status of our meal.  After an inordinate amount of time I got the cocktail I ordered and was presented with a very nice looking drink. However, upon sipping it I was greeted with a pickle-like flavoring that was immediately off-putting. Not sure what was in that drink but, in hindsight, it was a bad idea to drink it. Once the food finally came out, while it was very nicely presented, upon taking our first bite we immediately regretted our decision to eat at Cantina 1910. Even though the idea of the dishes were creative we felt there was a let down in the execution of them. The fried chicken with churros: the chicken was flavorless and unseasoned. It was almost as if salt had dramatically gone up in price after we entered the restaurant and they resorted to rationing it out. The churros were decent but the included butter was the best part of the meal (and most meals on the menu, likely).  My wife's tortilla soup: I tried my wife's order and discovered that my chicken lacked salt because it all used in the soup. I thought of dipping my chicken in the soup ""fo flava"" but decided against it. Moreover, the soup seemed to be mostly created out of jalapenos and soup thickening agents. It definitely needed some sort of stock to loosen up the oatmeal-like consistency of the ""soup."" Milenesa de pollo: chicken was overdone and had no flavor. Although the eggs were fine they weren't anything special. The gravy was lightly (i.e., cheaply) applied and the potatoes could be described similarly.  On top of the lackluster food our server barely noticed our presence after serving our food. In fact it wasn't until another server took pity on us that we asked we were doing and if we needed anything. Also, he fixed the table next to us after almost flipping the table onto himself, which was nice of him to do and will save them a lawsuit.  I found out the servers share tips.

Service: Server was friendly and attentive, and loved that he asked if either one of us had any dietary restrictions. We hung around for a long time and were never rushed, had our waters refilled the entire time, etc. Really friendly staff. Food: Most things could be made gluten free - with the exception of obvious things such as the breaded items (e.g. tortas, churros). Guacamole was very fresh and tasty and a good sized portion. I liked the addition of the sprouts as it gave it some heft and liked the authentic flavor. For those of you who want unauthentic mushy, generic guacamole with tomatoes and cheese head over to awful Guadalajara down the street. Chips were fresh out of the fryer and tasty - portion is small but they refilled for free. The carne asada tacos were SO good! You get two of each taco per order. Authentic, flavorful: pillowy soft tortillas (doubled them up), grilled steak was juicy, the salsa molcajeada was super fresh and spicy, but not overly so. If you have a large appetite, I'd suggest ordering two orders of tacos, plus that way you can try some of the other flavors. Margaritas were solid - not too strong or sweet - went down smoothly. Good selection of cocktails, beer and wine - even had a cider! The space and décor is absolutely beautiful! Room upstairs is great and would be a great space for a birthday or large group dining. I need to get the inside scoop on the interior designer, impeccable taste! Overall, a beautiful space with authentic Mexican food with high quality, locally sourced food. If you are looking for your usual hole-in-the-wall Mexican food, you'll be disappointed by the lack of grease, fair portion size, and mid-level cost.

2016-03-03,4.0,"Great addition to the Andersonville dining scene! I had been meaning to try Cantina 1910 ever since I had a taste of their tacos at the Midsommarfest last year. They weren't open then and I was anxiously waiting for them to open. When they finally did, the place looked gorgeous from the outside but every time I'd drive past it, I'd wonder how come not more people are in there. Always looked a bit vacant. Anyway, I went in on a Wednesday evening for dinner and had no issues finding a spot. The layout inside is neat and sophisticated. Very charming. My waiter was friendly and knowledgable and took the time to explain to me the nuances behind each of their inspired fusions. I ordered the Esquites for starters. Wasn't super impressed. My friend liked it but I am still partial to the street vendor version. It tasted a bit too bland for my liking. The portion though was good for the price. I had the al pastor and the fish taco. Both were excellent. Succulent and tasty! Although for the size, the price is a bit steep compared to your dive taco places. But I suppose the classy ambiance is also factored into the price. The dessert though was absolutely delicious! I had the Jacko's Ponche cocktail and really liked that. It was strong but delicious. I don't know if I'd go back on my own to eat there but if I have friends/family visiting, I'd definitely take them here to experience some of the fusion items and take in the rustic yet sharp atmosphere of the place.",0.997,0.724,0.239,0.037,0.6866666666666668

And what if I told you that they decided to open a Mexican restaurant in a city known for some of the world's best Mexican restaurants? But they made their food and drinks overly complicated seemingly just for the sake of being different? But it just took favorites and classics and made them worse? Available now to Andersonville: Cantina 1910. What a waste of a great space and local ingredients.  Really good Mexican food is all about complex flavors in perfect harmony, taking simple ingredients and elevating them to a higher level.  This place just completely misses the mark for the most part.  Some individual parts of dishes were genuinely very good (for example, the pork in the al pastor tacos was perfectly cooked and very flavorful and the tostaditas accompanying the guacamole were very good).   However, none of the dishes came together as a cohesive dish.  Despite the good elements noted above, neither the al pastor tacos nor the guacamole are as good as you would find at a good taqueria, let alone compete with excellent Mexican restaurants at similar price points to Cantina 1910. It is really a shame because the space is really promising and the service is very good.  The menu just needs a complete overhaul to live up to their promise.",0.994,0.748,0.207,0.045,0.4600929152148663

I had the Bears Club.  Fantastic - The carne asada tacos.  Awesome. - The braised oxtail on bone marrow tortilla.  Amazing flavor.  Probably my favorite dish. The average: - The guac was great, but not better than any other homemade restaurant guac. - The PUERCO EN CAZUELA.  Interestingly if the pork loin is taken out of this dish it would probably be better.  While the loin was tender, it was the al pastor and chorizo that made the dish. - The ceviche.  My husband liked this dish better than I did.  I found it to look and taste more like a sashimi dish with large, single pieces of fish. - The service: average to slow.  It took nearly 10 minutes to get our cocktails and another 10 minutes once we ordered a bottle of wine.  So, we sat at our table at least 20-30 min of our meal without drinks. - The acoustics.  It's not that this restaurant is noisy.  However, something about the acoustics made it hard to hear our waiter which left us guessing at a lot of what he was saying.  However, aside from that he provided great service. - The funky food.  While most of the dishes were pedestrian enough for anyone to eat, some dishes contained items like head cheese and pig's blood, which aren't palatable to everyone.  I consider myself adventurous but wouldn't try these.

The cocktails here are quite inventive and I definitely recommend checking those out.  I understand that this place is looking to put a fancier spin on Mexican food but unless you're looking to drop $25+ for one of their dinner plates you'll be leaving hungry.   My opinion is there are much better places in the city to get some authentic mexican food but if you're looking for something not served at your local taqueria you should give Cantina 1910 a try.",0.5451,0.911,0.06,0.03,0.36527777777777776

2016-02-05,4.0,"I know there was a big ordeal when Cantina 1910 first opened - where Andersonville natives assumed that this would be a 'cheap Mexican eats' kinda joint (of which the city already has a legion of - I live in Logan Square and I will attest to the multitude of great cheap Mexican places that deliver on authenticity and price - L'Patron lengua tacos, I'm lookin at you). Cantina 1910 is not one of those places - I don't think it ever claimed to be, which is why I'm a little puzzled about all the reviews snubbing this place as phony and practically an affront to the neighborhood. Cantina 1910, simply put, is a higher end Mexican restaurant (people, look at the Yelp $$$ before you get yourself into a tizzy over the prices) that focuses on quality ingredients, imaginative menu options, a gorgeous interior, and solid service. If this restaurant was located farther south, it would probably be constantly packed. I've been to Cantina 1910 twice now, both for brunch. Both times I was very happy the food, the service (the waitress the last time we went was definitely on the newer side, but had a great personality and was very charming), the atmosphere, and the overall dining experience. You get a sense that the owners have put a lot of thought into the details, and are working hard to provide an elevated dining experience to its patrons. I've ordered the chilaquiles (asked to make them spicy with the salsa verde) and the milanesa de pollo - both were really flavorful and well executed. The chilaquiles are listed under the 'Meidum' portion of the menu, however I thought the serving size was very large (had a LOT of leftovers that proved equally tasty the next morning). I've also shared the cinnamon roll, concha, and cajeta crumb cake with fellow dining mates, and all the pasties were REALLY good. Like I wouldn't mind popping in for a cuppa tea and a pastry on a lazy Sunday morning in the future. I've also sampled some of my boyfriend's chicken and churros (their play on chicken and waffles), and while I thought the churros were 'okay', the fried chicken in the dish was PERFECT, so moist and flavorful and wonderfully tender. Overall I have really enjoyed the food from Cantina 1910.

What works is the open feeling of the room and staff. It's a difficult place to just stop by on a busy night, but I managed to make it work. What also works is the staff, whom I felt went above the usual politeness of hospitality and really worked to make me feel welcome even when there wasn't an immediate space just hang out. Money is always going to be a factor. People are going to blanch at $12 drinks and $13 Civeche. If that makes you go to the taco cart then go to the taco cart. I get it.

I was not disappointed. There's a nice selection of upscale takes on Mexican cuisine in a variety of portion sizes, as well as a good selection of beers and cocktails, and a passable wine list. VIBE: 1910 is larger than I expected, with a bar room and a larger dining room featuring communal tables plus banquettes with two-tops against the wall. Lighting is good: not bright, but light enough to see and appreciate the food. Décor is tasteful: ""rustic"" wooden tabletops, a few bold graphics, whimsical light fixtures. We were there at an off-peak time, so noise was not a problem (though my sense is that it might be conversation-challenged when busy). SERVICE: Another advantage of dining off-peak: relaxed, attentive, helpful service. Everyone was cordial. GOOD: Ensalada con diosa verde was a treat, with fresh greens, avocado and a perfectly perky pibil vinaigrette. Puerco en cazuela was super, with luscious pork loin slices, toothsome carnitas, and perfect red beans in a marvelous sauce. NOT SO GOOD: My companion's chochoyotes en mole Amarillo was delicious, but there was too little molé, and the masa dumplings were too chewy for her taste. The tres leches de café dessert similarly featured cake that was too heavy, in her opinion. The dessert was also massive, enough for 3 or four people.

The bone marrow beef tostada was delicious. I would've just eaten lots of those if I hadn't been so full. This is not a typical Mexican restaurant. It wants to be so grown up and serious like Topolobampo but it is more rustic, and lacks the ease and complexity of flavors and textures that you want it to have. If you are looking for rice and beans with your tacos, go elsewhere. The decor is very run of the mill hipster mod-industrial, with a giant portion of the space dedicated to communal dining.

I live in Andersonville and have been to most of the restaurants and was excited to try a new, farm-table, upscale, Mexican restaurant. As well as finding out what all the yelping is about :) We went for Dinner: Interior-minimalist, modern, wood tables and warm ambient light. Con: loud dance music on a Sunday night. We had to talk loud to hear each other. Food-Quac and Chips were DELISH. Fresh, creamy, a bit chunky and the chips are homemade. I am a big connoisseur of guacamole. It's my litmus test for a Mexican restaurant. I make my own and usually prefer it to most restaurants. This is better than mine! Worth the $. Tacos al pastor were really tasty but a bit dry. I'd definitely order them again though. I know some people commented on the small portions but I don't mind. I think most of our restaurant portions are way too big anyways. Drinks-Friend ordered tequila flight. They looked amazing in those flutes with orange rind twists. Smelled really good too. I was told the rich, citrus smokiness of them were unique. Service-Friendly, prompt and attentive. It was slow and bitter cold outside. They sent us the wrong plates a few times. Could improve on that. Bottom line-If you're looking for free chips, salsa and big Margaritas, not the place for you. No Jimmy Buffet songs here. However, if you're looking for a a new twist on Mexican that is tasty, unique and fresh then you'll enjoy your experience here. For me it's not a place I'll frequent every week or 2 weeks for dinner but I think it's a great addition to the neighborhood and Latin fare.

2016-01-13,4.0,"So this was my first foray into Cantina 1910 and right off the bat I will say that the food was excellent. Surprisingly (in a good way), the menu was not at all what I expected. Foregoing the more traditional, and  run of the mill, tacos and enchiladas, Cantina has a deliberately more refined menu; featuring items such a ceviche and masa dumplings. This fare may not be for everyone, but I really enjoyed my puerco en cazuela- a dish with perfectly cooked pork served three ways and mixed in with brussel sprouts, cauliflower and beans. The flavors were truly mouthwatering. The service was friendly and efficient and the ambience was modern yet relaxed and inviting. Only two ""sort of"" negatives: First, I ORDERED chips and salsa...an issue for me.  The chips were clearly made in the restaurant, crisp, tasty, not oily and perfectly salted. And the three different salsas that accompanied the chips were very good. Still, charging for chips in a Mexican restaurant is like charging for bread in an Italian restaurant- a cardinal sin in my book. I'd rather have the chips served with one, less fancy, salsa...for free...and with free refills. This is just a given in a Mexican place. Second, the price. I don't mind paying for excellent food, which this was for sure. But over $52 for chips and salsa, one entrée and a glass of wine is a bit steep. I'll come back for sure, but not as often as I would if this place were reasonably more affordable. The price point, I think, will definitely turn a lot of people off, which is sad because Cantina puts out some excellent flavors.",0.9969,0.734,0.235,0.031,0.5436235827664399

I loved the tacos, but almost didn't want to call them tacos as the ingredients nestled into that tortilla were unlike any taco I've had before. The esquites was an amazing dish, deep refined flavors. Everything really knocked it out of the park for me.

The guacamole had a nice touch of crunch with the raw roots that I appreciated but the tostaditas were a bit tough and felt stale for my liking.

For dinner I tried the tacos. Calabaza- rajas, squash, sunchoke, young peas, queso fresco and the  Pescado al mojo de ajo- garlicky fish, fermented red cabbage, chayote, salsa roja both stuck out to me.

2015-12-23,4.0,"Cantina 1910 is a good place.  A clean, well lighted destination for higher end Mexican food. Readers of the other reviews may have noted that there has been a kerfuffle over what Cantina should be.  Simply put, it is not a place for endless chips and salsa and pitchers of margaritas.  It doesn't need to be that place, for in Chicago they are legion. So, with that out of the way, let us begin our journey, for it is delightful. My noble bourbon boozers, ahoy!  You will be pleased here, for the bourbon cocktails are excellent.  Particularly the 1910 old fashioned, with Buffalo Trace and Mezcal.  It is a hearty, smokey version of the classic.  You should have one.  I also had a cocktail served with smoked dry ice - I think it was Jacko's Ponche.  I ordered it because of the absinthe, and it did have a sazerac style flavor.  The presentation with the dry ice (don't drink it!) was a bit of an Aviary/Alinea flourish, which I could take or leave, but the drink was tasty, which is most important. A collection of tequila and gin cocktails round out their house cocktail menu.  They also have a decent collection of beers and wines by the glass.  I particularly liked that they wine menu had rose by the glass, which pairs well with the myriad spice combinations on the menu. On to the food! The guacamole is fresh, creamy, and flavorful.  The pig's blood chili is a standout, with rich, earthy, smoky, iron rich flavor.  And the al pastor tacos are a classic preparation, acidic and savory.  They were all delicious. We ended with splitting the Chocolate dessert - chocolate mousse, vanilla crema, cinnamon tortilla - it too was a standout, up there with desserts at Xoco.  The prices are a bit higher than a taqueria, but not unreasonably so, and it is reflected in the quality of the food.  We plan to return. A note on the seating - in the front of the bar, Cantina continues the unfortunate Chicago restaurant trend of thinking that cast metal stools from your high school shop class are suitable seating options when dining out.  Ask for a seat in the back room and you'll have moderately more comfortable seating, and can soak in the gorgeous colors of the banquette. As a side note, after we dined here, the chef left Cantina, for creative differences.  Its unclear what they are, but according to management the menu isn't changing in the short term.  You should check it out.",0.9939,0.855,0.128,0.017,0.6014598997493734

Unfortunately there was a hair in the guacamole and the stem/stub was accidentally left in -- more care needs to be taken with preparation. We were pretty conservative in our food selections, tacos, salads, chips/guac, margaritas, so if I go again I'd probably be more adventurous. I thought the prices were fair, and the setting beautiful. Our major issue was with the service. It was not lacking--the food arrived on time and service was attentive -- but it was WAY too attentive. I think in the hour+ we were there our waiter probably came over 40 times - it made us feel tense and uncomfortable - he was definitely hovering - about every minute or two he would come over to fill our water - even if it was full, he would fill it another half inch - a hand would reach into our table to take away an unfinished drink, a napkin, a plate, a utensil, etc. etc. It was constant. He seemed very inexperienced with not enough to do. We might have stayed for another drink and dessert but were made too uncomfortable by the constant interference.

2015-12-12,3.0,"I am kind of torn on this review after having Cantina 1910. There were some really good things here and some things that needed work. I've heard some news about this place - both good and bad - so I was a little excited to try it. First off, I think the space is beautiful. It's kind of modern rustic and it works well. I did feel like I was somewhere around downtown. The menu is pretty limited and not necessarily cheap, but at the same time from the minute you walk in the door you should realize, if you've actually eaten in enough restaurants and eateries, that it is not going to be $2 or $3 for a few tacos. We got there on a weekend around 9pm and it was pretty crowded. Did not see anyone waiting for tables, but also didn't see that many spaces open. The space was definitely lively. For my dinner, I ordered a few micheladas which were really good. Among the best tasting I've ever had. They were not 100% authentic, but this restaurant is not supposed to be totally authentic.As far as food had, I got an order of al pastor tacos and a Peruvian style ceviche. I have had a lot of ceviche in my life and know it pretty well so I was excited to see it on their menu. The tacos came out first and they were super good, especially with the lime on it. Like I was actually surprised how good they were. The price was high but I already knew I was going to a place that isn't exactly cheap. As far as the ceviche goes - I was really disappointed. The presentation of the plate was really beautiful, but the ceviche was prepared totally wrong. One of the biggest components of any ceviche is the acid component (i.e. lemon or lime juice) and it was completely and utterly missing from this ceviche. I don't know how to sugar coat that. It was just missing which is kind of ridiculous. I didn't think the flavor was great either regardless. You could have called it something else and given it to me, and I wouldn't have thought it was good. A little tweaking though and it could have been way better (the introduction of the acid component, which should have been there, might have helped). For dessert I had the chocolate which was pretty good. Not out of this world, but still pretty good. I also had some of my friend's fish dish which I'd rate as slightly above average. There were a lot of textures in it which was great and the flavor was pretty good but it was missing a little something to kick it over the edge. Overall, the place is nice inside and the service was pretty good. The food had its high points and low points for me, but it seems like the place has some big potential, but it's not all there yet. I'd come back to try it out because the experience was mostly positive and I really hope they can improve on some things.",0.999,0.714,0.235,0.051,0.5915737734487734

The banquet tables along the back in the secondary room are too brightly lite and although i had a good view toward the outside, my companion was staring at a dizzying array of patterns and colors which don't work together (no mirror, so you can see what else is happening).  Also, the reclaimed wood tables with multiple knot holes will soon be Petri dishes and will take some serious attention to cleaning to remain hygienic.  The trio of tequillas cocktail was a good idea in theory, but are indistinguishable from one another due to the addition of an undisclosed red liquor and orange peel - would have liked to be able to contrast them and believe that each style deserves its own treatment/accompaniment to bring out their best qualities. Generally, the food suffered from using many ingredients vs. building flavor.  The exceptions are the more simple dishes including the tacos, the homemade fresh salsa and pickled vegetables which were very tasty.  The Peruanos ceviche was good, but too many flavors to process.  The fish special was a good sized over cooked filet on top of a wheatberry pilaf had components that did not add to the overall flavor and balance (i.e., mussels and crab soaked in some type of liquor but still remained fishy and sharp tasting sprouts).  Passed on dessert.",0.9792,0.818,0.135,0.047,0.4470068027210884

2015-11-23,2.0,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! I do not usually do this, but I have had 2 separate bad experiences at this place, and that merits a warning to others.  Decor: On my first visit, we were lucky enough to be seated at an individual table rather than the terrible communal tables. NO ONE wants to eat at a table with a bunch of people they don't know, especially when you are paying a considerable amount of money for a ""nice meal."" The decor of the back room is terrible: tacky, cliche swedish motifs on the banquette mixed with uncomfortable industrial chairs, light fixtures that look like hair balls, and bad art. The lighting in the space is equally terrible, casting unflattering shadows at anyone sitting at the banquette. The space is full of hard surfaces that do nothing but enhance the loudness, forcing you to scream at the person you are dining with. Service: Both visits, we had incredibly awkward service. The host was overly energetic and downright annoying, while our server was inattentive and quiet.  The worst part: I FOUND GLASS IN MY DRINK. I was having a margarita (which has since disappeared from the menu... interesting choice for a Mexican restaurant), when I bit down on something hard. I was able to spit it onto a spoon to find I had been chewing on glass. I notified the server nicely, because I knew it was his fault, and he casually took it away with a mild apology. Later, someone who I presume was the manager, brought me out a new drink with a defensive apology. He did not offer to comp ANYTHING except that one drink. They should be embarrassed that they consider that hospitality.  Food: The FIRST time, the food was pretty good, however, the portions were so small that we left hungry (after dropping $100). The SECOND time, after waiting nearly 30 minutes after the time of our reservation, we were seated at a terrible communal table in the ugly back room. The server recommended the guacamole, which we remembered being good, so we ordered it again. They serve it with literally 8 chips, and it was the SALTIEST guacamole I have ever eaten. I LOVE salty food, and it was way too much for me. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. After waiting too long for our server to check in on us, we paid for the shitty guacamole and left. Andersonville is a wonderful neighborhood with SO many great restaurants. Do yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE else. The food at Cantina 1910 is overpriced, the service is awful, and the entire restaurant seems to have a pretentious, ""sceney"" vibe that does not fit in with Andersonville's culture. It's a shame it's not better because they did a number on the old T's building, and the architecture looks great.",-0.9505,0.703,0.134,0.163,0.5437113066145325

Went to Cantina 1910 on 11/21.  It was the first really cold night in Chicago this year and the restaurant was freezing.  We sat up stairs. Many people upstairs were wearing coats and scarves.  The bathrooms was like an ice box and there was no running hot water.  I don't know if the cold was a product of all the windows in the place or a heater that wasn't working.  I hope the management figures the heat issue out. Drinks are good:  good beer and wine list.  The cocktail list looks interesting,  but for a restaurant that serves Mexican food,  margarita options are few and far between. As for the food:  We started with Guacamole which was good.  We then moved on to the Classico ceviche which was OK at best.  It's didn't have a lot of flavor.  We decided to share tacos.  We ordered chicken, fish and al pastor.  The al pastor were the only tacos that were good.  The chicken and fish didn't have a lot of taste.

2015-11-23,2.0,"I'm done. It shouldn't be this difficult to like a local place. I wrote a lukewarm review a few weeks ago because I just found the menu odd -- filled with peculiarities I frankly don't eat, such as head cheese and beef hearts. So today at the urging of several friends and acquaintances, I decided to head back to try their breakfast, which I heard was good, and to buy a $100 gift card for a family member's birthday, someone who is far more adventurous than I am about food like the above named peculiarities. A $100 gift card to this place would make a nice gift, right? And hell, I haven't had breakfast yet, so let's be a sport and give Cantina 1910 another shot.  So I walk in just now in what should be the breakfast rush is a sad-looking man at the only occupied table out of...hm, let's say 20 tables. Not a good sign. It's unclear to me whether or not breakfast is table service or order-at-the-counter, which is hardly a counter and more like a faux rustic table bought at Cost Plus World Market.  No signs in place about how to proceed, no hostess or host but hell, I think to myself I'll just figure it out and I walk up to the rustic table but there's no one there. So I simply say ""excuse me"" to learn whoever might be in the kitchen and ask if I can buy a gift card for a birthday gift.  A sad look then bestows upon the face of the early 20 something-year-old woman and man, who indicate that they ""don't have gift cards or gift certificates or anything like that,"" which would allow me to spend my hundred dollars in the restaurant for a gift. I asked to speak to the manager because it seems ridiculous to me that the owners are going to pass up an opportunity to make $100 on the spot -- and the sad man and woman tell me that there is no manager on duty and that they are the only people in the restaurant with the exception of the ""cook"" -- an odd word to use in the context of such a celebrated restaurant. I figured it's just unusual to not say ""chef."" They both proceed to tell me that they're quitting later in the week and that they ""don't know what's going on here"" -- I could go on but I think you get the picture. What kind of business model turns away an opportunity to make $100 on the spot? Sometimes bad is just bad. I've watched this happen to their other restaurant Crew.  I will not be apologetic for calling something as it is. Listen, my gripe is not about the food. I don't need chips and salsa with every Latin meal. What kind of restaurant operates that way? With service personnel saying they're going to quit, no clear prototype for how the restaurant is run during breakfast and lunch (which is at best confusing to customers), no management on site during the breakfast/lunch shift, and turning away an opportunity to make 100 bucks on the spot? What kind of business model and restaurant is this? Listen I know many of us have friends who are associated with this establishment, but that is not enough of a reason to pretend to see this as something other than what it is.",0.9613,0.782,0.127,0.091,0.5604928017718716

2015-11-20,2.0,"Here comes the cliche comment...""I do not typically yelp"", I do not.  In fact, this is the first review I have given in over 4 years.  For some odd reason, I felt I had to.  I have been in the industry for over 18 years as a chef and take yelp reviews with a grain of salt as 99% of yelpers are self entitled, wannabe food critics.  Elite yelpers, you should all kill yourselves.  Maybe that is a bit harsh, but then again, so are Elite yelpers.  So again, my advice stands.   But in the case of Cantina 1910, I am hoping my feedback will spark some better execution of the menu and this place will not meet an untimely closing. We dined on Thursday night, the same night that Hungry Hound was filming a span shot.  So let's get to it: The decor/ambiance=A+ Simple and clean, yet still inviting.  Reminds me of a scaled back interior of Mercadito without the loud music and trashy River North gold diggers.. Too bad the food does not :(  The Service=A+  Smiling host staff, managers who help run drinks and do table touches.  Servers who greet fast, and food runners who explain they dishes as the present them.   Drinks=N/A  We did not partake in the nicely devised drink menu as my GF is still recovering from being under the weather and I didn't want to drink alone.  I did have a beer off the servers suggestion, and it was great.  But you judge a place by cocktails.  So there for, I can not rate them.   Food=D  The only thing that saved this from being an F is the guacamole and the overall plating.  The fat washed chips served with a nicely seasoned guacamole was on point.  The chef lets the chips do most of the talking by not letting the fat flavor be over powered by over seasoned guacamole.  Well done.  The Callos De Hacha started off promising.  Beautifully plated, but the scallop's fishy smell could be picked up the moment the food runner put them on the table.  Once we tried, it was overwhelming.  No hint of acid in the dish, just a fishy smell and taste.  Not sure where she is sourcing the scallops, but scallops should never have a fishy smell to them.  EVER.  These reeked!  So on to the tacos, we had the carne and the pescado.  The fish again, had a fishy taste and aside from that, no flavor.  The carne was also void of any in your face flavor.  Maybe some heat, garlic, something.  Both tacos where flat.  Plating was ok, nothing great.  A lone charred pepper and lonely lime acted as garnishes.   Last, the Tortilla De Harina.  Again, BLAH!  The meat was perfectly braised but lacking any flavor.  Plated and arranged nicely.  Just no flavor.   The menu is great.  It just needs better execution.  This is by no means an attack on the chef, I KNOW how hard it is to have a place open while still working out the kinks.  But it has a long way to go.   Price=D  The portion sizes are way too small and the prices too high.  The quality isn't there to be charging these prices.   I am not writing this for yelpers.  I am writing this in hopes that the right people read this and make the changes as I would love to have this be the go to spot in my area.  I hope my honest and candid review was helpful.  Take care, and good luck.",0.9983,0.749,0.187,0.064,0.5654563492063492

In fact, I almost WANTED to hate it, just out of loyalty for all of my fellow Andersonville folks who were slammed by that ridiculous--and heavily flawed--Reader article.  In fact, even though we watched this place go up brick by brick and live only a block away, we avoided going for a long time because we were so sure it was going to suck. Then, the Reader controversy started, and we had to try it--just so that we could, you know, write another bad review in concert with our other folks from the 'hood. However, from the second we were greeted by the ridiculously kind and genuine host--who didn't bat an eye at our bringing in a big baby stroller, btw--we knew that we were in trouble.  We went for brunch on a Saturday, and there was plenty of seating. This place is huge, beautifully decorated, as others have noted, and definitely has the vibe of a hip downtown spot--like the many by big restaurateurs in the city. That is, it feels intentionally and thoughtfully planned. Our waitress was kind, if not a tiny bit green and clumsy, and the brunch menu is vast and varied. We started with the rice pudding/granola bowl, and it was DELICIOUS. We also had a couple of fancy coffees from their drink menu. Both were good, though the iced chocolate with mesa was--different. The cinnamon roll was flaky, warm, and spicy. The milanese with mesa gravy was yummy and hearty. My wife had huevos motulenos, and she thought it was very good.  I didn't get the fried chicken and churros this time, but you better believe I'll be back for it! By the end of our meal, we knew that we wouldn't be writing the scathing Yelp review we were so looking forward to. In fact, halfway through brunch, we knew we'd have to come back for dinner. What's more, they are open pretty much all day, everyday, which is a rarity in these here parts (as they say). It's really nice to have a higher-end breakfast option during the week. I don't want to discount the other reviews. As I said, we haven't done dinner, and, in my 10+ year experience as an Andersonville foodie, I've learned to trust the instincts of my neighbors.

What really creases me, though, is how uncomfortable all the seating is at Cantina 1910.  Those backless metal stools are NOT ok.  Neither are the cheap metal chairs at the bar.  WTF????",0.9392,0.76,0.17,0.071,0.6522807017543858

2015-11-16,4.0,"I had to come leave a review when I read about the glut of 1 and 2 star reviews this place was getting. I can't believe it. I guess many people just want a run-of-the mill, predicable neighborhood Mexican joint, but my wife and I are both excited to have an upscale Mexican place in the neighborhood. If you just want tacos and burritos, there are plenty of options, but Cantina 1910 is an inspired, farm-to-table restaurant, not a whole-in-the-wall taqueria. We started with the chips and salsa--yes, you have to pay for it, and it's not ""bottomless."" But then again, this isn't a whole in the wall serving bagged chips and simple, predicable salsa. It sounded like the salsas change from time to time, and the ones we got were very tasty and not your run of the mill green and red sauce. The pickled veggies were also a nice touch. My wife had the Chochoyotes En Mole Amarillo, and loved it even though she's sometimes iffy on squash. The masa dumplings were tender and the sauce was rich and hearty. I went with the Frito de Bacaloa--fried smelt with Brussels sprouts and corn smut (huitlacoche.) It was fantastic and a great way to try something adventurous like huitlacoche that I've been interested in trying for a long time. Definitely not something you'd find at most Mexican restaurants. I also had the Tortilla de Harina y Tuetano--a hearty, savory taco of braised oxtail and pickled mushrooms on a bone marrow tortilla. It was my favorite part of the meal, and I highly recommend it. All the desserts sounded fantastic, but my wife and I finally settled on Horchata and Chamoyada. Both were creative and delicious. I particularly liked the Horchata, which called to mind the beverage while combing several latin dessert staples like Arroz con Leche and Flan into a unified dish.  The only reason Cantina 1910 isn't getting 5 stars is due to a few hitches with the service, which overall was on the good side of average, but a few specific moments didn't sit well. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to easily answer our many questions. He helped me pick an appropriate mix of small plates to make a meal without over ordering. However, when our food started to arrive, it became clear that our order was wrong--the runner initially brought out two of the same dish, and immediately went to speak to our server when he realized something was wrong. The extra plate went back to the kitchen and we dug in while we waited to hear about the missing dish. Our server never acknowledged a mistake, and simply said ""the rest of your order will be out shortly"" about 5-7 minutes after our food initially arrived. The missing item arrived almost immediately after he said that, which was a reasonable amount of time that wouldn't have been out of place if he had been coursing out the meal. So I wasn't too upset, but I would have rather had the waiter level with me an admit the mistake. Then, when I couldn't decide between two desserts, he made a recommendation, which I took. But then when our desserts came out, I got the one he HADN'T recommended instead of the one I ended up ordering. Since we were interested in the desserts we got, we never called this mistake to his attention, so I can't complain about it not being rectified. We were more than happy with what we got, anyway. Try this place out if you want some different, and nice. If you just want a place where you can get the same meat and beans in 5 different forms, there are plenty of options elsewhere.",0.9989,0.791,0.185,0.023,0.4737041373926621
2015-11-14,4.0,"The space of Cantina 1910 is impressive. It's uncluttered with large windows and bright colors; a neat mix of minimalistic industrial, loft and Mexican décor. It's divided into multiple rooms - some upstairs and some down. I've only been in the café room in the back. The café portion is large enough to be an entire restaurant on its own. In fact, you enter through its own door - a door that doesn't quite seal closed and makes for a chilly draft. The café has two long, communal tables in the middle, a padded wall bench lined with small tables, and still other seating options close to the windows. An employee stands at a pastry display table near the kitchen. It is with that employee that you place your order and pay. I've gone midday twice and have been pleased to choose between both breakfast and lunch options. The first time I went crazy ordering lunch food: sandwiches, salads, soup and other nibbles. And of course horchata. I LOVE horchata! The next time I focused on breakfast food: rice pudding, carrot cake flan and my favorite horchata (which is served either hot or cold)! All of the food was delicious. They used fresh ingredients, bold spices, that result in bright and interesting flavor combinations. The bread for the sandwiches were sturdy baguettes whereas I was expecting soft, round Mexican bread. The baguette was good, but a little too substantial for me and I couldn't finish the sandwich. My absolute highlight of Cantina 1910 (besides the horchata of course) was the rice pudding I got on my second visit. I freaking love rice pudding but THIS rice pudding tasted like awesome sauce! It was topped with caramel sauce, chopped pecans, pine nuts (?) and oats. It was my absolute favorite and I think that I will get it every. single. time. I. go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Cantina 1910 is still pretty new so I think that they might have a few kinks to work out (the drafty door and being able to take more than one payment at a time in the café).

We were very pleased with our first visit. Our server was terrific, very friendly and attentive. The drinks were tasty - we tried the margaritas and several of the wines.  I've seen some Yelp complaints about the limited supply of tortilla chips ... we actually thought this was a good thing. It kept our chip consumption down and kept us focused on just how damn good the guacamole was. I kind of wanted to thank them for that. We also really liked the ceviche we tried, which was very different than any we've tasted before. There was some heat and also some interesting flavors. It was a little on the pricey side, but worth it given how unusual it was.

I also tried the Cinnamon bun, nothing too spectacular but nonetheless tasty. I got the chilaquiles verdes o rojos. I've had this dish before so, comparing this one to the one I've had before is--its ok. The sauce was there but needed a little more flavor to it. I had it with the green sauce. I felt like the chips could have been a lil more drenched with the sauce. Maybe when I come back and visit Chicago I'll ask for an over easy egg on top. The Chilie sauces were amazing though!

2015-11-10,5.0,"First things first,  this restaurant is 2 months old... and they already have how many reviews from chicago's favorite foodie magazines. With that being said NEW RESTAURANTS ARE ALLOWED TO HAVE TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT. Ya'll need to stop berating this place because A) it is fucking incredible and B) They get a chance to figure out what works and what doesn't.  I am a foodie, to the core, I work at one of Chicago's most popular restaurants, where service is a top priority. Did a few things go wrong at Cantina 1910, sure. I asked for an espresso I didn't get and I asked fro the private dining coordinators card which I also never got. However they were obviously training a ton of new staff and are working on these issues. But they are new, and I forgive them, even coming from a highly service oriented place. I forgive them because they are down right delicious, Chef Diana is incredible and knows her shit. The people who are complaining about the chips and guac only having a limited amount of chips, stop being so fat, they are covered in beef lard and are tasty as fuck. And maybe just maybe Chef wants you to TASTE THE FUCKING GUAC and not just a fried piece of tortilla slightly dipped in avocado and tomato.  Chef is bringing you true mexican cuisine, in a fine dining way. If you want tacos off a truck or want to pay the tacos off a truck price then get tacos off of a truck... If you want pork that is the perfect combination of crispy and juicy, with the perfect amount of spice then this is the place you want to go. The bay scallop ceviche was absolutely amazing, who gives a shit if it is not as limey as the ceviche you are used to, she does this on purpose so you can TASTE THE SCALLOP. Chef traveled Mexico for 7 years preparing for this menu, and maybe she knows what ceviche is supposed to be just a little bit more than you do.. just saying.  All that being said, I'm obviously mad that people are ruining this new restaurant's reputation through yelp when they don't know what they are talking about. But this is my new favorite spot and I already have a reso for this Friday after coming in on Tuesday, because I have to try all the things I didn't get the opportunity to.

2015-11-09,4.0,"I've been to Cantina 1910 twice...in the past 5 days. Before that, I've made a couple dine in visits, and some take out visits. I'm very happy to see things steadily improving here and absolutely loved my dinners.  Since opening, there have been some tweaks to menu & pricing, which I think make the place more approachable. There has been some recent controversy after a Chicago Reader critic insinuated that all the negative Yelp reviews are not warranted and that the place is flawless. This was not only an attack on Andersonville residents, but unjustified. I've seen Cantina 1910 steadily improve over the past couple months, and have personally had not great experiences. Things can be rocky for new restaurants, and I'm sure some people did have some legitimate issues, however, some Yelp reviewers are turning their noses up at specific ingredients or the approach to cuisine. That is completely wrong - the chef has developed a unique and delicious menu, if it's not to your limited tastes, then that's your own problem! I do think it is important for diners to understand - and for the staff to share - the concept of the restaurant. They have a preservation kitchen which is used to preserve ingredients at the peak of their season, for use throughout the rest of the year, enabling Cantina 1910 to locally source as many of their ingredients as possible. This explains why pickled vegetables are common in many dishes. It's a unique approach and one that is well-executed. Ingredients are top notch, so prices are higher to cover that. If you want $2 tacos, head down to Los Arcos or any other divey-but-good taqueria in the city.  Thursday, I dined solo and had the Tortilla de Harina y Tuetano & Tacos al Pastor. The Tortilla de Harina y Tuetano is unique and incredibly delicious. The tortilla itself is made with bone marrow, for a slightly rich, very flavorful taste. The oxtail is well done and the pickled mushrooms add nice little pops of brightness. I've truly never had anything like this before.  The tacos al pastor were also really great, and al pastor is my favorite, so I don't give that compliment lightly. These are even more amazing when you take into mind that the chef is NOT going the traditional route of using pineapple to flavor the meat, but raspberries and raisins. The amazing thing is that you wouldn't know that if nobody told you - they are that good! As soon as I finished my plate, I wanted to order another, but instead I sprung for the tres leches dessert.  The tres leches was beautifully plated and a deconstructed take on the classic dessert, with some new elements like blueberries and walnuts. Overall, I liked it, but it left me too full and may suggest going for something smaller if dining alone. (I even got them to make a non-shareable single-sized portion).  Saturday I returned with my guy and we ordered some cocktails, the tortilla de harina, tacos al pastor, the garlicky fish tacos, and the esquites.  The esquites are a good starting point. They are good, but a little ""soupy"" with extra liquid and nothing to soak that up...tortillas would have been nice. The tortilla didn't disappoint, though I knew it couldn't. The fish tacos may have even been better than the al pastor! They were topped with bright, pickled red cabbage, which was not too acidic and complemented the fish, rather than drowning out its flavor.  Overall, I'm thrilled to have this spot in my neighborhood. The food really is top-notch and very unique...some dishes I will definitely have spontaneous cravings for.  People have been harping on the prices, but for the quality, I think they are mostly justified. My tab Thursday without dessert would have been $26 for a small plate, 2 tacos and a beer - that's not bad! They also text you when your table is ready, so if you live nearby or want to grab a cheap drink at Sofo down the street, you can easily do that.

If it weren't for them, I think it would have been fine. The service was friendly and we never felt rushed even though it took us awhile to determine what we wanted. I would have liked to ask more questions about the menu because I'm super picky, but it was too much effort due to the aforementioned loud group. I decided to just go for it and order without really knowing what I was getting. This turned out to be just fine. We loved the creamy, buttery esquites (server recommended).  Both my husband and I had the calabaza tacos; I also had the ensalada (the vinaigrette made this dish) and husband had the goat chorizo. Everything was delicious-delicate flavors in fresh, quality food. We both had two nice red wines as well. For desert, we had the sopapillas which husband loved; I thought it was ok, but then again, I don't really go for fried things. I don't really think this place is overpriced as others have stated-for 5 plates, 4 wines and dessert, it was about $100 before tax and tip. It might be a little more than other places in the A-ville, but the key here is that the food is really good and the service is nice.  (I will gladly pay an extra $20 to enjoy my meal instead of getting mediocre food and bitchy or inattentive service like you get most of the time in A-ville.)  I'm looking forward to returning here.",0.9946,0.792,0.18,0.028,0.5270658263305322

While this may be commendable (if predictable), it's no good if you can't get the food or the service right. The first time I went was near the time they first opened. We were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait, so we got some drinks and hung out at the tables in the foyer. All in all, this was a pleasant experience. About 40 minutes later, however, we decided to cut our losses. I texted the restaurant back to cancel our seating. After going elsewhere, we had already gotten our food when I received a text saying that our table was ready. I was willing to forgive this as a snag in the system, and figured they would figure it out later. The next time we went, it was for a Sunday lunch. We were seated in the time we were told, so at least that's been straightened out. After ordering drinks, I went to use the restroom. Both of the restrooms on the first floor are single-use -- not the best idea for such a large space. There was a sign suggesting that I use the downstairs washroom, except there was no indication as to where these might be. When I finally used the washroom, it took about 5 minutes to get the toilet to flush and, after I'd soaped up my hands, another 5 to get the sink to work. No bueno. I ordered the Mexican coffee, which was quite good. My huevos rancheros, however, arrived cold. The menu said that they would be served atop a ""Mexican rice cake"", which, as it turns out, was about tablespoon of rice that was completely insufficient to soak up the sauce or the yolks, leaving behind a cold, soupy mess on the plate. My dining partner's chilaquiles were also cold, and the overly acidic sauce was not well balanced. I had high hopes for this place, especially since there is a lack of Mexican food on Clark Street, but for now I'll have to hope that Frida's will come back.",0.3091,0.9,0.048,0.053,0.4332106782106782

The food was impressive to the palate, the environment was warm and the design aesthetic was tasteful. The staff was friendly and welcoming but not overly unctuous. With so many restaurants in the neighborhood coming and going, I was really happy to see a place go in that space I'd enjoy dining at, particularly because I hate almost everything. Check my reviews if you don't believe me. But I dug this place. It's obvious that they have gone out of their way to create an interesting, high-quality menu and a nice atmosphere. I do have to laugh at the tone of many of these poor reviews. People are bitching about the facade and portions ( ! ), essentially saying this place is putting on airs for daring to have a certain style and character from top to bottom. What did you want, another Frida's? That place was dirtshit. Heh. Have fun waiting outside for pastry omelettes at the Bongo Room.

2015-11-07,3.0,"Let's be fair here Yelpers... The problem with this place from my one experience is very easy to explain.   It's the food.  Went recently two friends and none of us liked anything they brought to the table.  Literally nothing.  At one point, we had to ask if the chewy ""nachos"" had liver on them, because that is what they tasted like.  Server had to go check, but came back to indicate they did not.  We had to believe him, because the menu had a lot of things on it I did not recognize.  Maybe consider offering alternatives that combine their pricy yet fresh ingredients in more simple and familiar combinations?  The space is great and the staff was cool. Wishing them well and love anyone that invests in the neighborhood.  I would give this place one more try eventually, but not soon.  I think they are happy with what they have created...",0.9854,0.778,0.201,0.02,0.5933673469387755
2015-11-06,5.0,"Yelp removed my review because it quarreled with other posters and Yelp [may or may not make terrible decisions about allowed content] It was a great review. Here it is, sort of. So many of the reviews of this restaurant are apparently from my [people], [people] whose opinions [are so super great]. Like them, I waited a long time for this restaurant to be open, only to be [concerned when reading some of the wonderful people's reviews]. Good thing they all have absolutely [great ideas for restaurants that aren't in any way based in old tropes about certain culture's cuisines].  It's certainly possible that some of the issues shared in some of the poor reviews have been addressed, but I find it unlikely that this was a 1-star restaurant two weeks ago and is now one of the better meals I've ever had.  Value - I'm shocked at the value at this restaurant and honestly think it might be too inexpensive. Look, I'm not looking to spend more money, but to call it overpriced is insane. My wife and I had three amazing drinks and plenty of food for two normal eaters for $70. $70! In what world would that be a bad value at this type of restaurant? The drinks are world class and cheaper than most cocktail bars/restaurants. Portions - For $7, you get way too many tortilla chips, two amazing salsas and a dish of house-pickled vegetables. [Good thing no one has complained] about this appetizer price[.] If you want free chips, go to Pepe's, but also [really enjoy your night at Pepe's Mexican Restaurant]. We only ate small plates and were beyond full at the conclusion of the meal. You don't need to order everything on the menu. Enjoy a few things and go home, then come back another time.  Let me repeat something here for those [NOT other yelpers, but just others] who don't understand how good restaurants work. You don't need to order 2 appetizers, multiple small plates and then entrees. This isn't Outback Steakhouse. You're not getting a free Bloomin' Onion when a NASCAR driver finishes in the top 10. Use your brain and determine how much you want to eat. Get this: you can even order a few items and then order more if you're still hungry. WHOA! Value - Let's go back to value, because I just can't get over this. This restaurant is sourcing super high quality, often local, ingredients and you want its prices to match up with Garcia's. Garcia's is great if you're a [sober, upstanding individual] who doesn't like to go home [too early], but you likely have no interest in knowing where those ingredients are from. The cows aren't grass fed. You might be lucky if they're fed...food. Ambience - If you think this restaurant is pretentious, you may not know what that word means. It's loud and filled with communal tables. Our server Tony (on both visits) was as inclined to spend time talking over the menu with us as any server I've had at any number of restaurants. He was knowledgable and terrific. There's nothing pretentious about this restaurant. That's just the lingering issues of [upstanding personhood] you have manifesting as a complaint. Yelp won't fix that. A therapist might, though. [I think therapy is great for everyone. It can really help you make positive change.] Mexican Food - This is definitely the number one concern I have reading the reviews. There's this idea that Mexican food should be similar to Chicago's many taco stands. I don't want to make assumptions about these reviewer's attitudes on race and culture [AND I HAVEN'T], but what about something being Mexican food means that it needs to be cheap or simple? Do you know everything about Mexican food? Do you have a concept of the varied cuisines in the different regions of Mexico? Do you believe any culture that has any kind of street food can't also have elevated food? Do you think that every American restaurant should serve Burgers and Fries? It's the same [silly] thing. [Oh shush] up about what you think Mexican food should be. If you want cheap Mexican food, there's plenty to go around. By the way, here's a tip, don't go to Topolobampo. You'll be horrified at how that hack Rick Bayless charges upscale prices for Mexican food!! All in all, if it weren't for the one star reviews written by [my lovely neighbors] who clearly [are scholars of] good food, this review would've been quite short. Cantina has really outstanding drinks, great menu variety featuring dishes, ingredients and techniques I've not encountered before. The space is a little loud and I'm no huge fan of communal tables, but I couldn't be more excited to have it in the neighborhood. If all that doesn't intrigue you, then just know that the churro dessert is about as good as possible. I'm not sure I'll ever forget it.  If my review doesn't do it for you, then enjoy a professional saying it so much better than I can:  chicagoreader.com/chicag…",0.9988,0.779,0.167,0.054,0.5271318595105003

2015-11-06,2.0,"Went to Cantina 1910 due to the recent articles defending this restaurant and we wanted to support a local business. Being from the restaurant industry, I will try and be as fair as possible.  Decor: Excellent. Good job. However, it was difficult to converse. Some sound baffling on the ceiling would help and also just turning down the music a little keeps customer voices down as well.  Host: OK. Offered a drink menu while in the waiting area, but nobody took our drink order while waiting. This is confusing for the guest as they have standing cocktail tables to drink at. Also,  for the size of the restaurant, they do not need ear pieces to communicate.  Tables: I understand the concept, but communal tables are difficult to pull off and may be off putting to some guests.  Drinks: They were tasty, but presentation was off. My drink was similar to a pisco sour, but presented in a glass milk carton with a paper straw. It would make sense if it had milk or cream in the drink, but the beauty of a drink with egg whites in it, is to sip the foam on top.  Place Settings: We did not receive silverware until after our meal came out. Also the busser delivered plates with large amounts of someone else's food still on them. He had to return with clean plates and silver.  Waitstaff: Our waitress was pleasant, but needed training. She was unfamiliar with gluten free options and claimed they could probably make any dish gluten free. This may be true, but due to cross contamination, is highly unlikely. Having a dedicated menu or training staff on allergens is critical. The waitress was equipped with and iPad to take our order. This made us feel disconnected from her as we had to wait between ordering items so she could type to the kitchen. It's great to embrace technology, but also makes it feel like a fast casual or fast food chain. A traditional POS system would be more effective.  Appetizer:The fish tacos were good. The portion was large for the tortilla size. A tip would be to split the same size portion of fish between three tortillas. This makes it easier for the guest to handle and gives the appearance of more food on the plate, although really only one more tortilla is used. Entree: The pork dish needed some edits. The pork was dry and under seasoned. It also was a small portion, regardless of the location of the restaurant or price point. It needed one more medallion to make it feel like an ample portion. The beans under the pork had odd seasoning and the only flavor that came through was white vinegar. The chorizo was excellent and should be kept the same. The pork skin was Ok. Smaller knife cuts on the gelatinous skin would help with mouth feel, so you don't get a huge chewy piece all at once.   Overall, the restaurant is still finding its place and that is great! I think they should embrace critique and edit as needed. We may go back in 6 months to check on their progress and see their hopeful improvements.",0.9982,0.793,0.177,0.031,0.5421500721500723

2015-11-04,4.0,"FINALLY a Mexican farm to table concept on the Northside. I absolutely love this place. I'm not sure why everyone is put off by the charge for artisanal house-made chips with locally sourced salsa. Or the fact that they don't have a million margaritas. That's not the type of restaurant Cantina 1910 was intended to be (See Cesca's a few blocks north). 1910's menu is inventive, delicious and made from scratch.  It did take me a while to land on a cocktail choice - their drink descriptions were mostly just ingredient lists of liquors I didn't know. I can say it is pretty adventurous, integrating Mezcal in their Old Fashioned, and serving a flight of 3 negroni-esque cocktails. I landed on the Meloncontes, a sparkling wine forward cocktail with a hint of tequila and Beckerovka (think classy Jager). For food I stuck with the tacos. I really enjoyed the Calabaza tacos on house-made corn tortillas. I'd recommend adding a second tortilla, however, it was a herculean feat to eat without making a fool out of myself after the tortilla tore. All in all, I had an awesome experience. Amazing and audacious interior, delicious food knowledgeable and friendly staff, and a unique drink program.  A few things I discovered while I was there: They DO have vegetarian chips, however the standard chips are not vegetarian. They will also customize almost any item on the menu to be vegetarian.  They are open almost constantly, serving breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. The bar was open until 2, which surprised me.",0.9907,0.806,0.172,0.022,0.580888888888889

Yes, the food is different. Yes, the food portions are a bit smaller. But that is what happens when you pay for quality.

2015-11-03,3.0,"I feel bad that this place is getting such bad reviews. People don't understand the concept. If you want ""Mexican food"" then go visit one of the little taquerias all over the city. This is gourmet dining, folks, and they don't have to be a copy-cat of every other Mexican place. Try to think outside the box a bit, ok? What I love about this place: The chips and guac, there are huge chunks of avocado in it and the chips are covered in beef fat which is awesome. When we ate all the chips, they brought us more (for free), so don't let the small amount bother you. The margaritas as amazing, and you don't need to have it on an awesome cocktail menu to get a great margarita (we all know what margaritas are anyway, right). The chicken and pork tacos were amazing, highly recommend them. Like most higher-end Mexican places, the tacos aren't huge  (2/order), but they're great for sharing with friends! We also had the cemita, which was excellent, but a bit too spicy for me (and I like spice). Here's the bad: It was loud, but many restaurants are. It was tough to have a conversation. We went in the early evening when the sun was setting, and there are absolutely no blinds on the west-facing, 2-story, floor-to-ceiling windows. Half of us were blinded by the bright sun coming in (we were on the second floor). I probably won't go again anytime in the afternoon/evening (unless they have blinds) when the sun is coming in, it was painful.

It's just guacamole.  The cured beef heart was a small portion (three thinly sliced morsels of beef heart... Morsels!,  think prosciutto...) that were cured in what tasted like soy sauce - a little smoke,  a hint of iron,  and definitely salty. Small bits of veggies adorned the top.  The scallop ceviche was served with a creamy sauce,  cucumber and not a hint of acid.  It was definitely a miss,  and should have been considered more a tar tar than a ceviche. I definitely missed the cool lime or acid,  tender edges of fish  etc.   I would skip it altogether.  Perhaps the only standout of the night was the Cemita,  which is a take on a torta or sandwich.  It has fatty fried meat,  beans,  cheese,  and sautéed bits of deliciousness inside.  Really the only flavorful bit of the night (besides the drinks)...  The service,  mind you,  though fine -  was a little distant.  She did a decent job of coursing the food, pacing dinner just fine.  Fine.  Overall a miss.  I was hoping this place would perk my taste buds up, with course after course of flavor after flavor.  Instead it was a steady flow of ""just ok""  which would have benefitted from Salt,  acid,  and slightly more attention to the combination of texture and flavor profiles.  Meh.",0.99,0.79,0.18,0.03,0.5272222222222223

Next, we had a ceviche and the beef heart appetizer.  I enjoyed the ceviche.  I dont eat beef heart, but my husband reported that it was very good and again had a good balance of sharp flavors with rich meatiness. We had the al pastor tacos and the fish tacos.  both were very well balanced and i am confused by the people who say they ate the tacos in two bites.  I dont love taco shells so I used my fork and it took me waaay more than 2 bites to finish the fillings. Our last savory was the tortilla.  It was a huge pile of delicious meat and the tortilla itself was thick rich and chewy.  Im excited to eat the leftovers for lunch! Finally, we had the tres leches for dessert.  It was a huge portion that easily could have fed 3 unfull people.  The cake was moist with milk and delicious with the caramelly cream and blueberries.  I didnt love the slight saltiness of the corn crema, but my husband did, so its just a preference thing. As regards service, we got fantastic attention and our server checked in with us regularly, our waters got refilled regularly and there were no problems at all. In summary, dont go here expecting a standard mexican restaurant, but do go here expecting a fantastic fine dining experience.",0.9955,0.726,0.197,0.077,0.6164257964257963
2015-10-26,3.0,"Everyday I drive by this place and the transformation it has undergone is quite grand.  Last Friday, I decided to check out this unique space for an early dinner. Good thing too because this place got packed quick. We arrived around 6:45 pm and was led upstairs by the host, and by 7:00ish, this place was packed! We ordered:  - Esquites - Before ordering this we asked the server to elaborate on the dish and he told us that this dish was like a better version of elotes. Growing up there were food carts that served elotes around my neighborhood, so I definitely got my fair share of elotes, but this dish was nothing like it at all. Yes there is corn and butter, but that was about it. Nothing really stood out about this dish other than the fried lime slices, which were pretty good! If it wasn't for the lime, this dish would be pretty flat in flavor. Texture-wise it was very one note too. - Frito de Bacaloa - Again we asked our server to elaborate on this dish and was told a very unappealing description, but since I was a fan of smelt, I decided to give it a shot anyways despite what the server said. Turned out to be pretty good! I wish this dish was served on a white plate or lighter color plate because you couldn't see the huitlacoche spread on the plate, which I thought went very well with the brussels sprouts and smelt.  - Callos de Hacha - Probably my favorite dish of the night. So sweet and delicate. This dish was on point. It just tasted so refreshing and light. The chard pico de gallo just gave the dish that pop of color and really brought the dish together. I could eat this again and again! - Carne Asada - This was our last dish and it was pretty disappointing. The ratio of meat to this tortilla was off. How the meat was sliced, it almost seemed incomplete because with my first bite, I took off more meat than I wanted to and it was so tough to chew. Lack of seasoning and overcooked meat made this dish very difficult to swallow.  Overall, the space is decorated tastefully with decent service. I will point out that our server did try to time our dishes so it would come out in accordance to our pace for the evening which was quite pleasant. In terms of the price point, you pay for the quality and the fact that these products from local farms ,which is great, but some dishes were a hit or miss during my experience.

The food is definitely not a traditional taco joint but a trendy take on cantina food. It was just okay and not something we would come back for. The flavors were actually quite bland and could use more herbs and spices, a little less salt (my steak and chicken tacos actually tasted the same).

2015-10-24,1.0,"Oh Cantina 1910...I had such high hopes for you.  Such.  High.  Hopes. If I could give this a negative five star rating, I would.  Where to begin? My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night to meet friends who had texted and let us know they were sitting upstairs.  When we walked in, we let the host know this.  Instead of the man believing that our friends were truly upstairs, he decided to walk upstairs with us to verify???  I saw my friend at the bar.  I said, ""I see my friend.""  Either he didn't hear me or didn't believe me, because he pointed at some random couple and said, ""Are these your friends?""  NO.  I think I know what my friends look like.  Thanks for the escort. Our first stop was the bar for drinks.  My friend wanted a margarita.  Seems logical for a Mexican restaurant, right?  NO margaritas on the menu.  Huh?  So she ordered a flight of tequila.  It was a pretty presentation--but everything tasted the same.  Like the orange peel that was in each glass.  So far, not off to a good start.  One beer and one glass of wine was $19.  Not cheap. We made the (stupid) mistake of staying for dinner.  We went downstairs and the host sat us at one of those long communal tables.  Fine.  Whatever.  But the table had this long, rectangular decorative planter in the middle which meant that all those ""small plates"" they were selling on the menu would not fit on the table unless you got rid of the planter. We ordered chips, salsa and order of guac.  I think it is ridiculous to have to pay for chips and salsa, so you would think that if you had to pay for these items, they had better be darn good.  Ugh.  I don't need painted-on-beef-fat chips with the worst salsa ever.  The salsa came in this little condiment trio thing (reminded me of what you see at Asian restaurants).  The ""pico de gallo"" was chunks of something and didn't really have flavor.  The red ""salsa"" part had no spice.  The third little container had pickled veggies.  Huh?  The guacamole was nothing to write home about.  It was more about the presentation than the taste.  Serving size was laughable too.   We should have left then. The menu is ridiculous.  It makes no sense.  First of all, if you are vegetarian, I think you might have a difficult time eating there.  What Mexican restaurant does not have rice and beans?  They have a rice dish that comes with ""squid piquadito.""  The rice just smelled and tasted fishy.  My boyfriend does not eat seafood, so he could not eat the rice.  The tacos were so small--literally two bites each.  And they fell apart after bite number 1.  $9 for four bites of my fish taco.  There are literally four entrees.  And they are soooo over-priced.  This place thinks it is in River North or the Gold Coast.   We ordered the Mexican bread.  I'm not sure you could really call it bread.  They were four little pieces of round bread (looked like cookies).  They were tasty--the butter was the best part of that plate.  But super small.  SUPER small. The dessert menu did not have much variety.  Our group left.  We were hungry.  We went down the street and spent our money at other establishments that fed us great food for half the price. Oh, forgot to mention our waiter.  He just put the icing on the cake of our horrible experience.  He made it very obvious he did not like serving.  It was like we were inconveniencing him by being there.  He just had an attitude.  So service was bad.  Food was overpriced and not that tasty.  The restaurant is pretty but the acoustics are such that the place is very loud.  Sitting on metal backless-stools at a communal table was not that great either. When I think of Mexican restaurants, I think of hospitality--a warm welcome and great food that will fill you up for days.   Cantina 1910, I don't think you are a good fit for this neighborhood.  If things don't change--concept, prices, menu, server attitudes, etc.--I can't see that you will make it a full year in business.",0.974,0.856,0.087,0.057,0.48770176615247035

I expected the aqua fresca to be refreshing, but it was so heavy that it came across intense and very sweet. The icing on the cinnamon roll is great, but the roll itself wasn't that delicious - it just didn't have that warm doughy texture that you want in a cinnamon roll.

Our server recommended we move on to a light ceviche to pair with our white wine, it did not disappoint. It was a bay scallop from New Jersey that had the most savory creme composed of cauliflower. This chef is really upping her game by making ceviches more than just lime juice and salt. We shared some tacos next, and then moved on to larger plates that we all shared a little each. I had an amazing pork casserole that had chorizo and red beans, pork loin, and even a little pickled pig skin. My friend ordered the chotoyotes which I was a little jealous of not having ordered, the mole was unique to itself and the dish had these smart gnocchi like dumplings made from corn.

2015-10-14,1.0,"Wow. I really wish I had checked Yelp before walking in here with my wife on a rare date night without the kids. We've never been so offended by a server at a restaurant, but let me start at the beginning. It's wednesday night. The place is busy, but not packed. The host (who is wearing an earpiece like he works at the Gap for some reason) says if we'd like, we can sit wherever in the ""cantina"" which is the front section with lots of long communal tables, but gave us the whole you-don't-have-a-reservation-let's-see-if-we-can-squeeze-you-in routine for the dining area. He spends a few minutes on an iPad talking to a runner about where they can put us. We get to the back room and there are plenty of open tables, yet we are seated at a long table with another couple. Fine.  We sit down. All of the tables are pre-set with wine glasses, silverware, candles, and water glasses. A guy, who we will find out later is our server, inexplicably comes by and removes the wine glasses without saying a word. After a bus boy fills our waters, our server comes back around with the menus. He drops them off on the table, again without saying a word. There are some nice sounding cocktails on the drink menu, and the food menu is a bit on the pretentious side. It sounds pretty good, but the descriptions go back and forth irregularly between Spanish and English.  ""Anthony"" our server (or so the receipt says, he never introduced himself) comes by for a drink order. When we realize he actually is our server, we feel like we've been written off by him already. Like we don't belong in this restaurant. We order a cocktail each, and two appetizers. Guacamole and Esquites. Our appetizers are eventually brought out, and they are wrong. We got the chips and salsa instead of the guac. Fine. Mistakes happen. The cocktails came a little late, and tasted fine, but they had paper straws in them...like the kind they make you use at the zoo. I guess it's environmentally friendly, but a $13 cocktail is kind of ruined by a paper straw.  Our server comes by and takes our menus before we can order entrees! He assumed we were done! We sort of wonder if he is really swamped and is just having a rough night, but no, we watch him sit and chat and explain the menu, recommend dishes, etc. to other tables and even though he passes right next to us a dozen times, he never says a word to us. We finally had to grab him and ask for our check. We both have a lot of serving/restaurant management experience and we have never ever stiffed a server, but we just couldn't bring ourselves to leave a tip. When we left my wife was in tears because she thought maybe she looked like she didn't fit in, and that's why we were just completely ignored.  We planned on spending a good hundred bucks on a nice meal out, instead we left with half eaten apps and half finished drinks, wen't across the street to Konak's and had a giant combo plate of appetizers for $10 and a couple beers and tipped the server 40%.

What did we observe?  Well, we found our bar server (for the 45 min wait) charming, and mostly attentive.  Here's where it gets weird:  the tablets.  Our order was done on a hand held tablet.  It's a bit pretentious in an environment that was purposely designed to be brutally stripped to its essence, including metal benches and industrial accommodations.  Secondly, it was clearly something in development.  The servers obviously didn't have enough variations or options in their menus and ended up getting our orders wrong, not once or twice but pretty consistently. Drinks:  good selection, if expensive.  A friend tried some cocktail that was one of their specialties, but when it arrived it looked like two raw eggs had been put in a champagne glass and served.  In fact, this drink was so deeply unappetizing that it was left fallow on the table, only having been sipped once.  Disgusting. Service:  After being moved from one intensely noisy environment to another (note, this is NOT a place to go on a date, ever...) we were seated at another common-seating table (party of 6 at an 8-seat table with two apparently forgiving other guests) and introduced to our server Dominick.  He was juuuust the right server for our group.  He had a personality that could work with our group.  We are not difficult but we have all known each other forever and can be hard to ""corral"" to listen to his intro to the restaurant.  He emphasized (at length) the ""farm to table""concept but this isn't anything new at all.  When we had perused the menu, we had a few questions which he answered with aplomb.  Again, the tablets are jarring and are obviously connected to the bar and kitchen.  He hadn't completed the drink orders and some of the drinks were arriving at the table!  But, and you know there is a but, several of the other drinks started coming piecemeal and some didn't arrive at all.  What's so wrong with a written ticket?  The iPad things are a fail guys! Food:  OY vey, enough with the organ meats.  I don't care if it's trendy or a foodie thing, but there's a reason butchers have to practically give this waste product away, and it has a very limited place on a menu.  One dish?  Fine, if you must.  But it was on several other items.  I mean, carne asada tacos don't need ""chicken liver mousse"".  Not here, not there, not anywhere.  It's gross and smacks of trying too hard.  The chef may be trying too hard to be trendy or ""new"" but let's drop the act and start working on the flavor and spices over some crap from Top Chef.  This isn't reality TV.  The guacamole was a stand out!  5 chips basted in beef fat?  What?  Guacamole and 5 bloody chips?  The shredded radishes on the guac were unique and delicious.  I had the carne asada WITHOUT the idiotic mousse and they were good.  4 of the six in our party had these tacos but when delivered none of the servers could actually discern which had the mousse and which didn't.  So they had to take them back to the kitchen to deconstruct their deconstructed Mexican food to figure it out.  I blame the tablets.  Again.  Still.  Lastly a serious negative on one appetizer:  Goat Chorizo.  Don't order it.  The 4 non-vegetarians all agreed it was too far to the ""game"" flavor and had little to no spices.  Hardly chorizo, and wholly unappetizing. So, I still gave this place 4-stars because their service was good and they are new.   Cantina 1910:  Stop trying too hard.  It's going to be the end of this place if you don't start to read these and decide if you'd rather stick to the expensive experimental limited menu or give people at least a couple more mainstream dishes if they're not feeling so experimental. Yes, I'll try it again!",-0.9301,0.806,0.086,0.108,0.5612831065133695

This is not a ""traditional"" Mexican restaurant as some reviewers seem to have been expecting.    This is more elevated Mexican (which does not mean snobby or pretentious) and similar to what I have had in Northern California, Phoenix, Puerto Vallarta and more locally at Mexique and Takito Kitchen.

It's definitely NOT authentic Mexican, or Mexican...at all...like not even a little bit. Let's just get that out in the open now. In other news, the drinks were good but the food was average, at best. The experience overall was OK, until I got home and found that my card was authorized for an amount higher than our $200 tab (despite nearly everyone paying in cash). My card totally got authorized for someone else's tab. The same thing happened to a girlfriend of mine, who used a card as well. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who informed me that they would get back to me, but they never did. He even asked me if it's possible that someone had my card information. What?! To specifically authorize charges at your restaurant? Really?! Luckily, the extra charge fell off my account a few days later. However, as soon as that charge fell off, another posted in the amount of my original bill. Again, I called the restaurant and got no resolution so I had to go in-person. After speaking to another manager who said he would resolve (I even showed him the double charge on my bank statement for proof), I followed up after a few days and received no response. I got tired of playing the cat and mouse game so I just called my bank to resolve the issue. I feel that this situation could've been handled MUCH better, especially by management.

2015-10-08,1.0,"It's definitely a consistent theme here and my experience is no different and being a local resident I too had high hopes for Cantina 1910 as there really are not of local Mexican options.  Unfortunately I had a very similar experience as others.  Overall I think whoever came up with the concept for 1910 either did not do their market research or had their own arrogance to not listen to that research.   Success of higher end or cuisine that is not typical of Mexican restaurants can be seen by great chefs (Rick Bayliss) or restaurants like Adobe Grill or Mercadito.  Each of these restaurants have the traditional as well as not so traditional offerings. This helps appeal to a diverse consumer base.  Cantina 1910 appears to miss this concept.  Mercadito is probably the closest to their concept but has heartier portions and better drinks at a lower price.  They additionally have the AA Lounge. Upon a arrival you would expect to see a range of margaritas on the menu.  However there is not one.  The server explained that they have margaritas an asked what I wanted in it.   This to me was quite perplexing in that I was the one who had to create my own drink to get what I want.  I liken it to going to a martini bar and there's no menu.  The server also explained that the have an amazing drink Director (I believe that was the term) and the drinks on the menu were really good.  As I look at some of the recent pics I saw one of what looked o be dry ice in a glass. Again, that's great and cool if your in river north and trying to ""be seen"".   Onto the food. So yes the chips and salsa was a big disappointment. The cost for what you got was not worth it.  Tortillas cost a couple bucks for a dozen.  You get one get into five pieces here.   Salsa was good but not $8 worth.  The tacos are very small and for the price (@$4 each) you would think that you wouldn't have to spend $16 just to get your fill.  I will say the al Pastor was delicious though but not at $4.  The ceviche was okay but again if you are going to compare to other places which also includes ""you get what you pay for"" I think Cantina 1910 misses the mark. Overall, I hope this place succeeds and the management does start to listen to the reviews here to make improvements otherwise they won't last long.  They need to really work on drawing people to them as they are already at a disadvantage of not being in the heart of Andersonville where many other options exist.  Pretentiousness exists only for a few in the neighborhood who are willing to accept. I'll wait a couple months and see how the reviews (and responses if mgmt does) are on yelp before I return.  I don't think anyone is hoping they fail, quite the opposite.  But you have to know your customers and demographics not what you'd like it to be.",0.9932,0.808,0.135,0.057,0.4395138888888889

2015-10-06,5.0,"Like everyone here, I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of Cantina 1910. Andersonville prides itself on its dedication to helping local businesses shine and thrive, and the team behind Cantina 1910 have literally spent years developing this restaurant, running another business (the Sofo Tap) and supporting other local businesses and events. I'm so happy that they are finally open! I have eaten four meals at Cantina, one a week with friends or family or solo for the first four weeks that is has been open, and on each visit, I see things changing and coming together, and the constructive criticism on here being thoughtfully responded to, and most importantly, the food and drinks remaining consistently delicious! For example, the tostones that come with the guac are now being fried in lard, which renders them a lot crispier and more affordable than the beef fat-fried tostones, and thus now the refills are free. There is also more wall art to capture the dining room noise, a margarita has been added, and there are several price points for cocktails. My favorite starter is the masa and blood sausage nachos, truly a standout dish, an inventive twist on nachos with the thin, cripsy masa cakes standing in for tortilla chips and the blood sausage for typical ground beef or carnitas. The esquites, nixtamilized corn with brown butter sauce, a favorite from the beginning, has become even more delicious with the additional accent of thin dehydrated lime slices. The arroz negro, with squid providing a briny kick, is another standout. The verdolagas, greens in a garlic chile sauce could convert the pickiest eater to kale.The tacos deliver as well, with the carne asada being some of the best I've had and the corn nuts on the pozo-pollo a fun, unusual touch. I have yet to try the entrees or brunch, but will on subsequent visits this fall. The desserts are memorable as well, especially the sopes, and large, and meant to be shared. In fact, the size of the share portions is delightful, it is great to be wowed at both the beginning of the meal (see suggestions above) and at the end as well. I love this new (to Chicago) take on Mexican cantina food. There are many places in Chicago that do middle-priced, very delicious yet very predictable Mexican food very well.  Cantina 1910 has a more ambitious mission-- seasonal, farm to table Mexican food that also reflects the bounty of the Midwest-- and while they may decide to change course a bit (the menu is, after all seasonal and thus ever-changing), I very much like it for what it is. I'm not looking for another (fill in the blank).  I also really appreciate  the boldness and cleverness of the drink menu, and I have had either a Dr. Boyfriend or an Old-Fashioned (my go-to cocktail, and they do an excellent version here), on each visit. I do not drink gin or tequila, so I can not comment on the other drinks. When I had dinner there last night, I was solo and I sat at the bar and both the bartenders and the beverage manager kept me well-supplied with tastings and suggestions as I enjoyed my meal. I enjoy dining alone as much as I do with friends, and I love the fact that the bar staff was so friendly and the perfect amount of attentive. I do agree that the main dining room is a little noisy, but I've noticed a tamping down of the acoustics over the past few weeks, plus the seating feels intimate (the lighting helps), so it encourages a bit of leaning in. Last but not least, the space is absolutely gorgeous. Well-curated art and wallpaper and fixtures and furniture, and the upstairs dining room would make a lovely space for a small wedding reception or private party, with it's views of Clark Street and the dramatic but whimsical steampunk-like chandeliers.  The service has been excellent on each visit, and I love that the chef and beverage manager are working the room--serving food, making drinks, talking to the guests, soliciting feedback. All in all, Cantina 1910 is a wonerful addition to the neighborhood, and I look forward to seeing what it offers as the seasons change.",0.9994,0.783,0.207,0.01,0.51697410093514

My experience was phenomenal. I could taste the thought, creativity, and care that go into the food and the cocktails. I knew going in about the local sourcing, the high quality ingredients, and the upscale resumes of the restaurant's creators, but I figured all those elements could just as easily be lost in poor execution. Thankfully, almost everything here works. We had the goat chorizo and the black rice as starters, and they are excellent. The tacos are even better. The flavors and textures of the meats & vegetables defy description in the best way possible. The cocktails (I had the one with absinthe) are an experience worth the price. The only negative with the Cantina is the sound level. The space is gorgeous, but it is cavernous and can be quite noisy. Fortunately, we arrived before 6 and avoided the crowds, so it was manageable for us. This place is a winner.

The Wait: get better at estimating how long the wait will be.  Was told 10-15.  Actual wait time was 30-40 minutes. The Cocktails: I was surprised there wasn't a premium margarita on the drink list.  Is this supposed to be deconstructed Mexican?  I was confused as to whether or not it was ""cool,"" to order a marg.  Ordered micheladas during our wait & the choice to do a pilsner as the beer was not a good flavor.  The spice mix was weird and messy, this was maybe the worst michelada we'd ever had. The Food: $8 for chips & salsa.  I feel like if a Mexican restaurant wants their patrons to drink multiple $13 cocktails, then giving them chips is a better practice than charging for them.  We ordered the guac, which was tasty & a generous portion, but like others who have written reviews, received a small wooden bowl which contained about 5 chips which seemed chintzy.   I was so confused by the menu and it's rather limited offerings.  1 entree?  What's that all about?  Why not more than one entree?  If you're doing small plates, then don't offer the 1 entree.  The big ole sandwich seemed out of place too.   We also ordered: Scallop Ceviche: Very good, but a small portion for $16 Goat Chorizo: Delish - a favorite Tacos: Al Pastor & Carne Asada - good tacos.

We noticed that as we walked by and looked in the windows in the rear that there were a bunch of empty tables. We went upstairs (as the bar area was filled with people waiting) and saw a quite a few more empty tables. So my guess is they were unprepared to serve that number of people or they were REALLY staggering the seatings to help the kitchen. Either way it would be much nicer to have been allowed to sit and be told that due to opening volume there would be some wait on service.  But we waited anyway feeling more annoyed seeing all of these empty tables SLOWLY getting filled.  The host was certainly not the most welcoming (guessing overwhelmed by the volume as well). While waiting at the bar I was asked if I wanted to order a drink. I did order one then watched him serve drinks to waitstaff 3 times before I asked if he had my drink. He apologized and did give it at no cost but it was still frustrating.  After finally being seated our server was SUPER upbeat and expressive. We were surprised to see that the menu basically consisted of 5-6 varieties of taco pairs, a few ceviche options, a number of starters, ONE sandwich and one entree. Portions are SMALL which makes the price point seem high. We ordered some tacos and a scallop ceviche (if it wasn't so spread out on a big plate it would have not even filled a small ramekin). Both pairs of tacos were 2/3 bites a piece and had little texture or substance to them. Places like Ta-Ke-To Kitchen have tacos at the same price point and infinitely better flavor and appeal.

They have a window that opens at 7:00 which serves coffee, pastries, a breakfast burrito, etc. It is nice having a place on this end of Clark St that serves coffee and breakfast. However, it isn't cheap. A cup of coffee is $4, which makes the walk to Starbucks seem not so bad. The breakfast burrito was great, but $9. I was the only one at the window and waited about 7 minutes to get a burrito. For that price, I would prefer eating across the street at Bongo Room.  For dinner, this place is lacking in ambiance, service, and quality for the price. It was very loud. We waited 45 minutes for a table. When seated upstairs, there were about 5 tables open, which never filled while we were seated, so I was confused about waiting so long. The menu is lacking in variety. There is not a lot of options. I love tacos, and the Al Pastor tacos were not anything special. For $8.50 I would expect more flavor or at least more than 2 tacos. The nachos and guac were tasty, but again overpriced and not anything i am craving to have again (Big and Littles still has my vote for best tacos!)

If things improve, I'd be happy to come back and re-review the place. The Good: It's a lovely restaurant. Cocktails were interesting. Window selling coffee in the morning. The Tres Leches dessert was quite good. The Bad: The noise, it's really loud, not sure if that can be fixed. The menu is very limited. The tacos are very small for $4 each and not particularly special. Nachos were interesting but very salty and kind of average in taste. Where are the margaritas? We might try it again for dessert on a night when it's much quieter. I hope they keep working on the menu, because a good Mexican restaurant would do really well in this neighborhood.",0.9485,0.743,0.184,0.073,0.5139746031746031

Menu:  WTF is going on with this menu?  Strangest Mexican dishes I have ever seen.  They don't even have Mexican rice & beans on the menu!  2 taco's cost $8 and thats all you get.  The chips they serve with the guac were stale & greasy.  Deserts are $12 each!  Nothing on their menu is normal.  Yuck! Chairs:  The chairs you sit on are odd.  The way they are shaped if you are a larger person you feel uncomfortable because they dig into you. Service:  Poor at best.  Our server was quite slow, forgot our drink refill order, & we had to ask for our check several times. Honestly, I wish the old T's was still there because they had a better menu & it was fun to go there.  This place, forget it.  I only hope they turn things around, get a normal menu, & get rid of that horrible noise.",0.9291,0.744,0.154,0.101,0.5218484848484849

2015-09-25,5.0,"This review is solely about the food. Food and the flavors are outstanding! Pricey for the portion size and loud yes, but worth it. If you are looking for traditional flavors this is not the place, if you are looking for new, different flavor combinations that ""attack"" your mouth from different angles and melt in a perfect combination, then you must visit this place.  Here we go... We started with ""Esquites"" not traditional and good. The crispy lime give it an interesting twist. Far from the traditional mexican street food but really good.  My wife ordered veggie tacos and the steak ones. Her comment was the best veggie tacos she's ever had. They topped them with something they called chicharron, but was like finely shaved chips that were awesome. The steak on the tacos had an awesome flavor but as tacos they were just OK.  I ordered the Walleye ceviche.  I think the name ceviche is misleading I was expecting ceviche but instead I got a small portion of awesome flavors. I must admit the first bite took me by surprise, As I continue to eat this finely shaved fish and its toppings I could not stop and got better and better.  I was still hungry but so wanted to try more! Proceeded to order a ""Cemita"" which was much bigger portion than the other plates. This was a breaded chicken sandwich with al pastor pork. I do not like head cheese, but heard this, like many other ingredients in the menu items, was homemade so I decided to order with out any change turned to be an excellent decision. I made a mess trying to eat this big sandwich, but like the other plates reviewed before, the flavors in it were unexpected. I over eat, could not stop myself.  I was not crazy about the wine selection, I tried the an Ohio Pinot noir, which was ok but I think from now on I will focus on the food more than the wine.

The space is beautiful, but I experienced a lot of the same problems as others: - 2+ hour wait. It was their first Friday night, but still. - Decent but watered-down and expensive drinks. - Totally bizarre menu. As someone else said, it feels incomplete. The small plates are wildly expensive and all portions are very small. - We paid $8(!!!) for chips and salsa and received less than a dozen stale chips and two mediocre salsas. - The tacos were $8 for two very small tacos. Again, they were just okay. - Service was not great. We ordered three tacos and received only two. We had to flag down a busser to get our waiter to ask about our missing tacos, since we hadn't seen him in ages. When we told him one taco was missing, he didn't apologize, just said ""oh, okay"" and reappeared with tacos 10 minutes later. - LOUD. I don't mind a loud restaurant, but I couldn't hear myself think. It's crazy how loud it was given how huge this place is. Right now, Cantina 1910 just isn't a great fit for the neighborhood.

Service: Upon arrival our server was very nice but didn't seem to have had serving experience before. The majority of the staff appeared to be standing around when the service and attention of our waiter were very slow. When they brought the food and drinks out they overly explained how we would feel about the meal. They seemed unsure about how we would react perhaps?  Drinks: extremely watered down. My margarita had very minimal tequila in it. My friend who runs a bar was familiar with the wines they had to offer and was shocked at the prices they sell their bottles for.  Food: the smallest portions I have ever seen for the price. The chips and salsa were fine but they provided you with so few chips it was almost like a joke. Then when we requested more the waiter sheepishly apologized for the additional charge. The tacos actually tasted great. Too bad the size and price didn't match.  Ambiance: beautiful place.  Conclusion: they spent too much money on fancy silverware, serving dishes and decor resulting in the prices being unreasonable to compensate. We went down the street to buy a second dinner and get real cocktails after our group of four left. I will not return again.",0.6116,0.833,0.091,0.076,0.48865740740740743
2015-09-21,5.0,"We were lucky enough to score a reservation on Cantina 1910's opening week. We loved the neighborhood feel of Andersonville and were able to find free street parking off of Clark. We even enjoyed a little shopping at the unique local stores before heading to the restaurant. The newly designed space is breathtakingly expansive. Cathedral ceilings in the entryway give it an airy quality, and we loved the interesting light fixtures. Rebecca, our server, was attentive and helpful, recommending craft cocktails we might like. The Meloncotes was refreshing, served with a melon ball floating in it. The Agricultural Convention, with its yogurt foam topper was different and delicious. (Don't let the yogurt scare you)  We enjoyed our drinks while trying all the ""sharable bites"" on the menu, beginning with chips and salsa.  The pickled vegetables that came with it were crunchy, with just the right amount of tang. The guacamole, nicely chunky, rivals XOCO's, and comes with some interesting beef tallow chips. (More please!!!) The crudo of shredded beets that topped it was a nice contrast in texture and color. I am a huge fan of Mexican Street corn, so my personal favorite was the Esquites.  Rebecca advised us what to do with the dried limes (crush them on top), and they were that perfect hit of acid the dish needed. Yum! We moved on to small plates. The generous Nachos were unlike any we've ever had. Unlike the ubiquitous layers of melted cheese and jalapenos, these nachos were served with a moronga chili ( a type of Mexican sausage), pickled chilies and fennel.  Think layers of flavor here! And the Goat Chorizo served on mashed potatoes turned out to be one of our favorite dishes of the night.  Too often chorizo is ultra salty, but this was nicely seasoned and well charred. We dipped our sausage in the mashed potatoes and green sauce and sighed with every bite.  To accompany our tacos I ordered another cocktail, the Dr. Boyfriend, (yummy). My son ordered Jacko's Poneche, which our server had recommended.  Dry ice is slipped into fragrant cranberry tea, which is then wafted over the Mezcal and Absinthe cocktail. Talk about cocktail theater! Everyone around us wanted to know what we had ordered!  Tacos here are served 2 to a plate. We ordered Pozo-Pollo (chicken); Carne Asada (steak) and Al Pastor (spit roasted pork). Their flavors were complex and they were all so delicious we had a hard time picking a favorite.  Finally, it was time for dessert and espresso. We ordered three different desserts. My husband's Camoyada was a beautiful orange color, and was a refreshing mixture of cantaloupe ice, fresh peaches, and vanilla bean ice cream. The Horchata was ultra creamy rice pudding with squares of flan in it, and pecan crema atop. Delicious! But the real star was the Tres Leches cake. Too often, Tres Leches is ultra sweet and somewhat soggy. This cake seemed to be made of whole grains of some sort, and was served with rum caramel, fresh blueberries, whipped corn crema and nuts.  It had been cut into 3 pieces, but after giving my husband and my son a taste, I ate all 3!  Cantina 1910 is an innovative high-end Mexican restaurant. It is the most creative, tasty food we've eaten in Chicago since Girl and the Goat.  Move over, Rick Bayless!",0.9974,0.837,0.149,0.014,0.6632189239332096
2015-09-21,2.0,"Let's get one thing straight: people are rooting for this restaurant to succeed. People in the neighborhood could hardly contain their glee when walking by this place as it took shape. There was a well of goodwill a mile deep for the owners to capitalize on as they got their operation up and running. But they somehow managed to burn through nearly all of it in one giant mess of an opening week.  Cantina 1910 seems to be on this quixotic quest to redefine Mexican food while totally utterly ignoring everything that makes a Mexican restaurant great. It's like they forgot to include the customer in their equation. I imagine the owners might brush off criticism like this by thinking the naysayers are unsophisticated or afraid of high prices or whatever. But let me be very clear: I didn't flinch when I saw an $8 chips and salsa on the menu. Instead I thought: these are going to be incredible! I couldn't wait to see what kind of mind blowing locally sourced alchemy went into making an $8 starter that only costs $3 at frontera and that is often times free at other low to mid-range places. Bring it on. What did I get in return? Stale chips, sickly sweet salsa with an incongruous spicy punch at the end, and a portion size that is so laughable we thought it must have been a mistake.  Well at least there are margaritas to make you forget...oops wait never mind. This Mexican restaurant appears to be so post-Mexican that it won't even put a margarita on the menu. I get it: maybe the chef thinks it's a cliche or maybe the fact that you can't get limes locally played into this. But for the love of god you know everyone wants a margarita so why are you punishing your customers? Just give them a bomb margarita. Better yet make a few. Look at big star. They have smoky mezcal ones and spicy ones and who knows what else. They didn't pull a Chilli's and phone it in. But they sure as hell didn't proclaim the margarita dead and add insult to injury by charging $13 for an alternative.  I could go on, but I think the message is pretty clear. You are in a city dominated by Rick Bayles and a dozen other superstar Mexican restaurants. This is well tread territory. Mexican food is a crowd pleaser. The neighborhood is falling all over themselves to support you. You locally sourced carrot salsa is going to get an uber-x and two mustachioed hipsters in one night only just so they can prove how progressive they are while the whole neighborhood walks by on their way to *anywhere* else.  It's not too late. We are ready to support you. Practically the entire north side is rooting for you. You have a beautiful space. A perfect location. And you are making Mexican food which even at its worst is like crack cocaine for anyone with tastebuds. You clearly have a vision and talent.  Just give the people what they want. If I might: start with a deep bowl of fresh chips, some kick ass salsas, the city's best margarita menu (go ahead and make them $13 but make them good) keep the tacos and the things you know are working, lose the pretension, and we will forget this whole thing ever happened.",0.9926,0.79,0.144,0.067,0.4924646464646464

2015-09-20,2.0,"It pains me somewhat to write this review because in the words of Tyra Banks, as she screamed at Tiffany in Season 4 of America's Next Top Model, ""WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!!"" I'll start with the positive: the place is beautiful, the food tasted good and the staff is very friendly.  A group of 6 of us were ready for a Saturday night out, with good Mexican food and Margaritas! We were told the wait was about an hour and 15 minutes, which was fine with us. It's a new place that everyone wants to try, so we'll just go up to the bar and have a drink....a $13 cocktail. Oh yes, that is not a misprint! Even Downtown bars aren't charging that much. And we'll need to get a second round because even though there are a lot of tables open and available right in front of us, apparently they seat people in 'waves.' I don't know, maybe seating in waves helps the kitchen keep up in some way... By the way, the only Margarita on the menu is a $40 pitcher that was supposed to serve 4, but that was a stretch.  We started with an order of guacamole, which came with 7 chips, maybe 8? It was tough, but i tried my best to hold back and not get full on that ONE chip before my meal arrived! Apparently, they are made with beef fat or something, so they are expensive to make. I was tempted to walk over to the liquor/convenience store across the street to buy a $4 bag of chips so we could eat the rest of the guacamole.  For dinner, you can either order tacos, a ceviche, or a plate of some things with fancy names that was $28. I opted for two orders of the tacos, which were very tasty, yet TINY. When we left, I had to go home and make something else to eat because I was still hungry. I really hope the restaurant takes the customers' comments seriously. Living nearby, I watched this place being rebuilt for the past two years, taking the place of an establishment that was a fun, relaxing neighborhood hangout. I want to come back next summer to enjoy the outside, upstairs patio... just not at the price of $13 per cocktail.",0.9887,0.868,0.113,0.019,0.38474903474903477
2015-09-20,5.0,"We thought it was amazing - a truly unique addition to the stale (but still decent) choices in Andersonville. First, the decor is simply stunning.  And considering the dilapidated property they started with, it's no wonder it took some time to get it back into shape.  Everything in here from food to furniture is as local as you can get.  I even saw the Square Nail guy down the street making their harvest tables!  It was a little loud on the night we were there but that's an easy fix that the owners are well aware of after chatting with them.  The cocktail menu is quite impressive - I had THE smoothest Old Fashioned - man, that was good!  A really nice selection of wines and brews, too; and many wines by the glass which is nice.  Ooh and try the Cava if you like crispy, dry sparkling wines! And the food....  Wow!  Each bite was a surprising flavor explosion in our mouths.  I always admire chefs who can think outside the boring box and really shock your palette.  This woman is one of them!  We had two different kinds of ceviche,  all five flavors of tacos and a couple appetizers, too.  Each was beautifully plated and presented to our table, and the flavors were incredible. And for dessert - a special shout out to the pastry chef!  We had the horchata, the tres leches and the churro - all full of flavor and beautifully presented.  I can't wait to try some other desserts, too. What's so cool about this place is that the shrimp, the fish, the meats, the produce - even the bourbon - are all locally sourced (and a locavore's wet dream!)  They're not using frozen shrimp or gristle-y flank stake from the SYSCO truck.  So if that's your kind of taco, look elsewhere! Some yelper called the menu pretentious.  Creativity is not pretentious.  It's innovative certainly.  it's challenging the Mexican stereotype or what we Americans consider to be Mexican food. It's trying to intensify the flavors you experience throughout a meal.  It's employing and supporting local farmers, vendors, craftsmen and artisans.  It's a definite culinary curveball.  But that's not pretension.",0.9967,0.77,0.195,0.035,0.561275017253278
2015-09-20,1.0,"THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT AND DELICIOUS! this place actually is terrible, do not let recent press fool you.  quoting this review completely out of context and calling me a jerk? poor form.  This place is inspiring me to start writing reviews because I have a deep love of Mexican, and sadly a deep love of paying too much for drinks and food at trendy upscale restaurants. Unfortunately in my hood of Andersonville there are a not a lot of options for me to do the second, let alone to combine both Mexican and paying too much for small plates. Essentially, when I found out about Cantina 1910, I was in heaven. Any place charging as much as this place for tacos must be doing something very unique.  And they are.... the place is uniquely terrible. Let us begin with the 8 dollar guac and chips, presented more as a fancy dish with an extremely small side of chips that have been rubbed with oil? My friend commented that they might be tostinos that they rubbed with lard so they might taste more authentic. We started with this at the bar and as we were carrying it over to our table the man seating us commented that chef intended us to keep this at the table the entire time, didn't explain why. Honestly seemed like a weird offhand comment. I found throughout the night that they loved to talk about the chef, it is like they already know how much she needs to be defended. I will say that the drinks we had at the bar were good, mostly because I really enjoyed the heavy etched glassware they have picked for their whiskey drinks.  But let's talk for a moment about the drinks. Where on earth is your Marg section? I know you are an upscale Mexican restaurant but some things are just a requirement and understanding what makes a delicious margarita and having it on the menu is a simple must. We told them how to make a proper margarita and I was pleased with what came to the table. Great job with following my instructions.  Upon sitting down, our waitress was really nice, but did absolutely NOTHING to get us geared up for our experience. You are a new restaurant. Give me the run down, get us excited, make suggestions. None of that here. We started with the goat chorizo (with smashed mash potatoes - with turmeric, ""chef loves turmeric"" and a ""non-spicy verde"" I get the idea this place is afraid of spice). The dish is pretentious and forgetful at best. and DRY. SO DRY. and then Cantina 1910 completely lost me when the ceviche arrived.  Ceviche is an amazing delicious refreshing power house of a seafood dish. It is beautiful and bright and has room for creativity and individuality, but there are some things it has to be. Ceviche is a delicious dish of fish cooked in citrus juices, often with vegetables and herbs added. I have had good and great, I have had it refined and I have had it simple, but I have never had it be so terrible as it was at Cantina 1910. First off, this is not a ceviche, it is a crudo, and at 17 dollars they have presented about 3 to 4 dollars of salty tasteless walleye in a way that says ""by throwing things on a plate I hope you people will trust that I once did a month working my butt off at Alinea."" I never do this, but I had to send it back. A place has to understand that you cannot treat patrons in this way, if you are going to do something and charge so much for it, please do it right, and make it ABSOLUTELY delicious.  The tacos came after and they were good. Were they good enough to be 4 dollars a piece? No, but we decided it wasn't worth squawking about. We finished the rest of our great cocktails and got out of there. This place honestly will have to really make some changes to stay open. Chef and crew should consider going out to eat at places like antique taco, big star, fronterra, and honestly I think they could even learn a thing or two from hole in the wall places like Erick's down the street on Lawrence.  All and all, was so excited but you can't sugar coat an experience like this. I thank them though, because now I finally have a yelp account.",0.999,0.779,0.178,0.043,0.5821122994652407
2015-09-20,3.0,"AN OPEN LETTER TO THE OWNERS OF CANTINA 1910: It's hard to gauge a new restaurant after only a few days of opening. It is a massive undertaking that is fraught with challenges, and I wouldn't wish that stress on anyone. However, first impressions can make or break a business, and there were some glaring (good and bad) impressions upon our first visit. Instead of being catty, I prefer to be constructive. The owners have obviously worked very hard to open a beautiful space and offer something unique for the neighborhood. They have the goodwill of the neighbors, and this open letter is in the hopes that they listen to the reviewers and use the customer feedback wisely. I'd prefer to start with the lows so as to end it on a high note. THE LOWS: Your menu/concept is confusing and seems very incomplete. We learned from a server that this is not yet your complete menu, but how would anyone know when all we've been hearing is that you're now officially open for business? Is this a soft opening? Was the server incorrect? Who knows? Communication and training are key. And in this case, this is fatal because a main course menu consisting of tiny tacos, one entree and a sandwich feels lacking. Your signature cocktails cost $13. Yes, they are creative and tasty. But they are $13. You are not in River North (I do see the ""River North"" reference coming up a lot in your negative reviews). Would you rather sell one round of drinks for $13 and scare people away after they get their bill, or price them at $10, have them order two rounds and come back another day? $8.50 for a taco duo is a good price. Until you see the size of the tacos. Ceviche prices from $16 to $17? You know who offers ceviche at about 20% less? Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill. I'm just going to leave that there for you to ponder. Small plates average about $12. You know who offers small plates at about 30% less? Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill. You see where I'm going. No margaritas on the menu, but you can order them....a pitcher costs $40.  You know who offers margaritas on the menu and for less? Every sit-down Mexican restaurant in the world, except yours. That makes you.....unique. Five tortilla chips with guacamole for $8. I'm just going to leave that alone and let you figure it out. THE HIGHS Your space is stunning. And that's an understatement. It's truly a lovely restaurant. Your taco dishes are fantastic and with great variety. Your signature cocktails really are very tasty. The service was fantastic. Everybody was friendly and courteous. Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu, and made our experience very pleasant. You did a great job training your staff. The farm-to-table and locally sourced concept is fantastic! That is what really makes you stand out among Mexican restaurants as well as other restaurants in the neighborhood. SUGGESTIONS: Retool the menu. Quickly. Right now. If there is more to come, then let people know. Make an announcement on your website. Maybe hand out a check insert card telling people about the exciting new menu items they can try when they come back. If there isn't more to come, then change the menu. Now. I'm sure you have to pay for that ornate space, but don't price yourselves out of business doing so. It seems you haven't read the consumers in the area very well. Andersonville is lovely. But it's not at the Gold Coast or River North price point. And your restaurant is. Communication. Reply to each of your Yelp! reviews thanking your customers for their business and their feedback. Take their criticism constructively and with humility. Ask the dissatisfied customers to give you another chance. But give them a reason to do so. There aren't that many reviews posted yet, so you do have time to answer them. I've seen some restaurants that reply to all of them. It goes a long way to let people know you're listening.

2015-09-20,1.0,"NO, NO, NO!  EPIC FAIL.  What were (are) you people thinking?  Get your money back from the consultants who have misguided you terribly.  You want me to pay for Chips & Salsa at a Mexican restaurant? And by chips I mean a handful that couldn't feed a child -  uh, sorry, not gonna happen.  Ordered the Chicken tacos that were smaller than taquito frozen appetizers from Costco.  Also had to ask if they even had margaritas (aren't listed on the menu), and received what was the size of a child's cup margarita glass full of sugar - FOR $13!  Acoustics are sooo bad we were screaming at each other trying to have a conversation.  We actually had to go home and order a pizza because we were starving, and just dropped over $100 on NOTHING!  Sorry folks, but this isn't the Gold Coast and you're trying waaaaay to hard for a simple, yet worthless menu.  You're in Uptown and we aren't going to pay for your nice new building, I give it a year.  I would re-think your menu, service and pricing really fast........I won't be returning.",-0.9494,0.825,0.025,0.15,0.5491260822510823
2015-09-20,1.0,"Pretentious menu, loud, and poor service. My water glass had a gigantic lipstick stain on it. I kindly mentioned it to our server. 15 minutes later, I still hadn't gotten a fresh glass and had to remind her. I don't care how busy they were. If there was an issue with cleanliness, that should have been a priority regarding service.  If you want to see or be seen, I'm sure Cantina is the place to go for now seeing as they just opened. I'd imagine that luster will fade.  My Mexican girlfriend and I went there last night, had 2 drinks, 4 tacos, and their average $8 chips and salsa. We laughed at the menu the entire way through our meal, headed home, and proceeded to order more food from Mas Alla del Sol (which is substantially better).  If you want better traditional Mexican, go for Mas Alla. If you'd prefer a fancier taco, a cooler vibe, and spectacular drinks (... For me, a superior Old Fashioned there), do yourself a favor and check out Little Bad Wolf.  Although we kept our spirits light through laughing at their menu (including wheatgrass on their Pastor, garlic ash in their salsa, and chicken liver in their Carne Asada tacos), we will not be returning.",0.8886,0.844,0.106,0.049,0.5218888888888887
2015-09-19,2.0,"Beautiful place. Nice waitress. Long wait and the hostess was not very friendly. Tacos al pastor were tasty. We tried carnitas, fish, and chicken tacos, scallop ceviche, guacamole, and other stuff. But it was just ok, nothing memorable. In addition, They were all tiny portions.

2015-09-19,2.0,"Summary: Beautifully and tastefully decorated. Really friendly and accommodating staff. A few very tasty dishes but some key Mexican favorites are missing the mark and there is a significant problem with price/value (worth what paid for). (Grade: C-) We live 3 blocks from this establishment and have been expectantly awaiting the opening of this place.  I have always wanted a higher end Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood and this place seemed to fit the bill. CALLING/MAKING A RESERVATION: The few times I called, no one answered the phone. This could be a problem.  We decided to just walk over instead. HOSTING/GREETING/WAITING Very pleasant experience.  Wait staff is very courteous.  I like the way they were very efficient in taking our phone number to text us back and then invited us to go to the bar or hang out.  The bar tender was very friendly as well. DINING: The Good: Our server was very courteous, knowledgeable, and responsive. I liked the way he was able to explain to us the farm to table concept of the restaurant, why the menu is sparse at the outset (they want to get things right first before launching a more substantial menu), and his suggestions for drinks and food, which seemed to be genuinely things that he liked rather than just the highest price items.  He also took care of us when our drink order was significantly delayed.  Great service. We ordered the guacamole and shrimp ceviche for appetizers.  For dinner, we got the two orders of tacos for one person (the tacos al pastor and taco carne asada) and then I got for myself the sole entree that was on the menu, which was a pork tenderloin dish.  I thought the guacamole was exceptional in terms of taste.  It was a little spicy but very flavorful.  The tacos and the main course were quite good as well. The Bad: In our book, to be worth its salt, a Mexican restaurant has to pass the SGCM Test (Salsa, Guacamole, Ceviche, Margarita).  This restaurant got a C- with only the margarita and the Guac passing muster.  First and foremost, being stingy on salsa and chips, for me is a no, no in a Mexican restaurant.  At this place, they wanted $8.00 for the chips and salsa.  We thought that was a joke, so we didn't even bother to try them.  In terms of the ceviche, I would suggest you bring a microscope to find the fish in the ceviche.  I am not sure who told the chef that when patrons order ceviche, what they want is marinated zucchini! Hello!!!  Plus, for eating marinated zuchinni you get to pay $17.00.  That's outrageous!  I should have sent it back.   The guacamole was tasty ($8-$9), like I said above.  However, it came with 4 apparently specially made chips (may be 5).  Again here, I thought this was a joke.  We promptly asked for a refill.  Our bartender was about to say something about charging for the chips but we looked at him like he was crazy and he got it.  He brought us ""house chips"" free of charge.  To be honest, I liked those better than the specially made ones. Remember I said that one of us had to get two orders of the tacos for dinner?  That's because each order came with two very anemic looking tacos.  They were pretty tasty apparently but we don't generally eat very much and we had to get two orders to make it a dinner. Finally, the main course that I ordered, I don't quite remember what it was called on the menu but it was basically a pork tenderloin dish with Mexican style beans.  It was quite well executed but, if you can believe it, they were charging $28.00 for that.  Now, I am not sure why pork tenderloin and beans cost that much. It seemed a bit excessive even for a higher end concept. In summary, I really like the concept of this restaurant.  I actually do like having a higher end Mexican in the neighborhood.  However, ""higher-end"" and a lack of value are not synonymous. Farm to table is not an excuse for jacking up prices without giving people value for their money.  I am sure the local farmers that we are supporting want the folks on the other end not to feel cheated and to have a pleasant experience.  The management should rethink their pricing strategy and/or the composition of the dishes.  Charging patrons $17 for ceviche that has no fish/shrimp in it, is not only false advertising, it's outrageous.  Bring your A-Game and get the basics rights.  For a Mexican restaurant to stand the test of time they need to be seen as excelling on the basics SGC&M. Stop being stingy on the chips and salsa.  Hello!! Sorry for the long review but I hope this was helpful. Best, Mark",0.9988,0.74,0.183,0.077,0.5094134727061558
2015-09-18,5.0,"Loved loved loved my experience. Zach took great care of us the entire time! Started with some guacamole crudos which were delicious! Nice crispy mini tostadas. My cocktail was a Diego Rivera which was sublime and refreshing. When my Al Pastor tacos arrived I was in pure heaven. I enjoyed the fantastic Agriculture Convention with my entree and it paired nicely. This cocktail is NOT TO BE SKIPPED. Trust me. We ended with some tres leches which was superb and complex. I was blown away by the decor- a nice modern take on rustic decor. Price points were a little high for drinks and dessert, but once you discover the complexity and hard work that goes into both, it has justification. Five stars because I could not give 6:) *to the harsh reviewers- it is a brand new establishment. Relax. It is just delicious food. Chill.

2015-09-18,2.0,"It's a great space, but this is a restaurant review, isn't it.   Part of my disappointment may be that I have been waiting forever for it to open.  I was hoping for a fun place to hang out with friends that also has great food, like the restaurant that previously occupied that corner.  Cantina 1910 is none of that.  Instead, it's a collection of bad ideas that have already been done elsewhere.  Tired, tired, tired. The drink menu is extensive and tries too hard to be hip and cool.  One drink that I saw, which I'll call the ""Flaming Mame"" because I have no idea what it was called or what was in it, smoked like Grandmama's teacup from the Addams Family or a junior high science experiment.  Gay Chicagoans in a Mexican restaurant that we were, we ordered margaritas, which weren't on the menu.  I don't think the bartender knew that they usually have an orange liqueur and a little sugar in them, but the dry lime and tequila was actually tasty as it was. The menu itself was problematic. I was there on its second night, so the chef was clearly still trying to find himself.  There were a dozen ""creative"" small-plate dishes, about half of which, including the nachos, featured organ meats, like headcheese or liver.  My grandparents, may God rest their souls, might have enjoyed that feature on a lark as a link to their own childhoods, but I'm grateful that they didn't enjoy internal organs enough to serve them at their own tables during mine.   We started with an order of guacamole, which was delicious--lots of garlic and just spicy enough without going overboard, perfect.  It struck us both as odd that the huge order was served with exactly five stale tortilla chips in a wooden dipping bowl.  We asked our server for a few more, because there probably was three cups of really good guacamole, and we waited.  My friend wondered aloud if someone had run out to Jewel for more because it was a long wait.  Eventually, one and then two more little bowls of five stale tortilla chips each appeared at the table just as our tacos arrived. I won't say entree, because Cantina 1910 clearly aspires to be yet another hackneyed hipster small-dish joint.  I had Pozo-Pollo tacos; that must be Spanish for ""Kung Pao,"" because it was spicy stewed meat with peanuts.  I am not sure if it was pork or chicken, but they were delicious.   After that course, we ordered the nachos, which featured liver and the same stale little tortilla chips.    If I were going to describe Cantina 1910 in one word, it would be ""derivative.""  A small-plate format with an ethnic bent and a weird fascination with organ meats is just like a subdivided restaurant a half mile north.  The goofy foufou drinks, the organic rooftop garden and the ""farm-to-table"" buzzword is just like a dozen places in Ukrainian Village and River North.  The name itself, Cantina 1910, seems like an allusion to the Mexican Revolution, and even that has been done in Lakeview.   It is very weird to me that Cantina 1910 went with tapas given that there is a location just a block north of them that has been three or four different tapas places in the last five years, none of which were able to stay in business.  There are no hipsters in Andersonville, and that location has aptly disproved Field of Dreams; they won't necessarily come, even if you build it. Like I said at the beginning, maybe it's just that Cantina 1910 is not at all what I was hoping for--a fun, local Mexican restaurant with great food, rather than a hodgepodge of hot trends from three years ago that have now gone cold.  I definitely hope that the owners get it together, but I found myself thinking that even if they don't, the next lessee of the awesome space they have built will be extremely grateful for their authentically cool and original architecture and decor when Cantina 1910 goes belly up.",0.9977,0.764,0.166,0.071,0.5235160818713451
2015-09-18,2.0,"Like others have said this place is brand new. I understand there are still kinks to work out, but most restaurants at this price point would have hosted a soft opening for friends and family to gain essential feedback before opening their doors. They did not because trust me, I was anxiously awaiting any sign to be able to try this place since we live around the corner and watched it go up over the past 2 years.  The good: -The food: We ate the black rice dish with squid which was perfectly cooked and flavorful. Tried the fish tacos and the al pastor tacos which were equally delicious. -The look of the space: it does look very well put together inside. Nice warm lighting. The bad: -The pricing: We wanted to try more food like the ceviche but at $17 that seemed outrageous. Their pricing on many items is too high for the neighborhood and the food. Dessert options were very small portions and all $13. $13!!! for a tiny piece of Spanish dessert, no way. Their cocktails were also $13 which is river north high. The neighborhood average is more like $11, I'd rather go to Marty's for that pricing. 1 small plate, 2 orders of tacos, 2 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine cost us about $100. Ouch. -Food options: Their menu is almost entirely small plates and not many choices. Boyfriend and I tend to eat less than normal people so sharing 3 dishes we were comfortably full, but the average couple would probably need to split more like 5 dishes. -The sound: Concrete floors are a bad idea in combination with the low ceiling in the back dining room. I had to get up and stand next to my boyfriend's ear to discuss what we should order so I didn't have to literally shout at him across the table. I still feel hoarse today and my ears feel like I was at a concert last night. Get some tapestries on the wall or wood flooring. -Everything else: We got there on the 2nd night of being open around 6:50 and were told 15 minutes for a table. After about 40 minutes I finally asked when we would be seated and they said we were next. I watched the hostess asking for a different party of two and after asking again when we were up, we were seated. Once seated I looked around the dining room and it was half empty! What on earth was the 45-minute wait for when half the tables are empty? Did you guys not hire enough waitstaff? Really confused on that one. Half the crowd in the bar could have sat down and avoided the now hour wait they were quoting to newly arriving guests.  I'm really hoping they lower prices, fix the sound and hire some more waiters in the coming months. I so wanted to LOVE this place and the food is good! We'll come back one more time after a month or so and I hope to update my review, but for now I can't see it replacing any of our go-to's in the neighborhood even though it's now the closest option to our condo.",0.994,0.798,0.137,0.065,0.4535964483545129
2015-09-18,2.0,"The taste is there, the look is there, the quality is kind of there... but if they don't retool their menu/concept, I highly doubt this is going to work in Andersonville. My husband and I were excited to try Cantina 1910 on their second night open, since we live a couple blocks away. We had no problem walking in, and the hosts/servers were very friendly. Upon reviewing the drink menu, we found two things a little odd - that the drinks were overly pricy/complicated for the neighborhood, and that the only margarita listed on the menu is a 4-person serving (which appeared to be a 2-person serving in real life) for $40. Since the drinks were coming out pretty slowly, we opted for wine, which was decent but nothing to write home about. The food menu contains mostly tapas-style dishes and tacos. We kept it basic and started with the guac and chips. The guac was nothing special, and like most of the other reviewers, we received 5 [chewy] chips. While I do believe strongly in portion control, 5 chips is laughable. One of the servers noticed we had finished them and brought us 5 more, so hopefully they are realizing that 2 people require at least 10 chips. Is there someone in the kitchen whose job is to literally count out chips? We ordered tacos next - beef, pork, fish, and squash. Even though the menu feels like they're trying a little too hard to be hip, I can't complain much about the execution - the flavors were interesting and tasty, and the combinations of proteins/garnishes ""worked"" - but the protein-to-garnish ratio definitely skewed light on the protein. The dessert options sounded pretty good, but I couldn't bring myself to spend $13 on a dessert, despite being the kind of person who believes that Jeni's ice cream is worth every penny and more. I think Nina C. summarized it best when she said: ""I don't know if I've ever been so disappointed by food that tastes good."" We spent ~$80 for a casual Thursday night dinner at a neighborhood joint and left Shania Twained (it didn't impress us much), a little hungry, and a little robbed.",0.9624,0.794,0.124,0.082,0.5190642303433002

The new building is beautiful, the spaces are pleasant, although really loud. The service is good, but I hope will get a little less stiff as they settle in. It's almost like they are trying a bit too hard to explain my guacamole. The drink list is ample, but pricey - River North pricey.  What killed it for me though was the food. I don't know if I've ever been so disappointed by food that tastes good. You heard me right - it's good food. The tacos we ordered were flavorful and the guacamole was good. But did I seriously just pay $9 for a smearing of guacamole on a massive platter and 7 (counted them) chewy chips?? And then another $9 for two tiny tacos? At least in a taqueria they throw some rice and beans in.  Here's the thing - I'm entirely willing to pay good money for a good meal, and do on a regular basis. But this just didn't work.

We started off the night with Off Color Farmhouse Ale which was really good beer, too bad they don't have a tap room to purchase 6-packs. We ordered the chips and salsa as an appetizer. It came with 3 mason jars: one with spicy salsa, one medium salsa, and one jar filled with pickled cauliflower/carrots sort of like giardiniera.  We tried out the Al Pastor and Carne Asada tacos. The Carne Asada tacos were skirt steak, and the Al Pastor tacos were the best tacos I think i've ever had in my life. We also ordered shrimp ceviche which was really good.  The service was excellent, and the food was great. I will definitely be back if I am in the area.
