2016-01-25,3.0,"MK is a surprisingly large location in the heart of the Gold Coast with a fun casual atmosphere.  We stopped by for brunch on Saturday morning and the place was basically empty at 10am.  Opting for coffee over booze, we also started with the salsa trio and chips.  Not the typical way to start a brunch, but Mercadito salsas are like crack and you can't avoid them even at 10am.  I wish the brunch menu offered just a few more items like their take on a breakfast skillet or regular eggs benedict (other than their smoked salmon option).  Not finding anything that really grabbed my interest, I chose the chicken enchiladas and my husband ordered the huevos ahogados.  They don't serve tacos until 11am and I still have my long-standing issue with Mercadito's taco rule which is you order in sets of 4 but they all have to be the same kind of taco.   The food took a little bit longer than expected which just enabled us to over indulge on the chips and salsa and our server happily got us more chips to finish off the remaining salsa. Probably not a place I'll make a special trip to go to, but if you love Mercadito tacos, it's probably easier to get a seat here than the original location.  A good option for a reasonable and quick brunch in the area but nothing memorable.  Service was friendly and the atmosphere is clean and open.",0.9948,0.786,0.203,0.011,0.5349477682811016

Everything was reasonably priced during happy hour, it never seemed to get extremely crowded..but at one point we felt lucky to have had a table. 4 stars because the service had seemed a bit slow for a Saturday, possibly understaffed for the time!

Their guacamoles are perfection. The salsa and quesadilla are also our favorites.  They used to have great specials for happy hour but have since changed their promotional prices without changing any of the promotional signage. Deceptive much? We went this past Monday and saw the signs still out that clearly advertised ""$5 margaritas + 1/2 off botanas on Mondays"" but after ordering we were charged FULL price for botanas and $5.50 for margaritas. When we brought it up to the server and front desk staff they notified us that that used to be the deal but it had recently changed. Had we known that we never would have ordered what we did.

A management that really cares. AND a great buy.  I'm astounded that this place exists --- so close to all of the dreck on Rush Street. I've eaten here a dozen times in the last six weeks. Sampled most of the menu. The tacos are delicious. No doubt. But so were the Chipotle meatballs. So was the Cobb salad, the turkey sandwich (no joke, really nice) and everything else.

The kids usually don't do well with spicy but they devoured this - only a small kick in the traditional guac. Their pomegranate version was a lot more spicy, but it was wonderfully balanced with nutmeg/cinnamon(?). Queso Fundido with chorizo on top was another huge hit with the kids. Andres' recommendation of the Auntie Ox cocktail was perfect for the post-flight unwind. For dinner we ordered chicken enchiladas and shrimp tacos. Every bite contained a tremendous mix of flavors.

Came here with a couple girlfriends for dinner and drinks.  We thought the food was pretty good.  The ambiance is super cute and the location is ideal for Gold Coast/River North. I ordered the mango tequila drink but it was too mango-y.  Luckily, I was able to trade it for a regular margarita. I was sad that the drinks were not as palatable as the sister restaurant.   I will say I liked the guac and my mushroom tacos; I also tried the rice and beans, and the Brussel sprouts.  I don't eat meat but I could taste a hint of bacon in the Brussel sprouts so that was not too appealing for me.  I also tried some of the creamy corn and it was good.   My favorite were the tacos, though.  However, our waiter lagged a lot once we got our food.  He asked us after we were done eating if we needed anything else and when we said no he still didn't give us the check (and we had been sitting there for 20-30 minutes after eating).  He seemed to be more helpful to the other tables (maybe it was because I traded my drink in?)

Moving on.....the salsa's were okay.  For $7 I got three small dishes of their salsa.  The tomatillo was the only one that I really care for.  The other two had kind of a weird after taste.   But it was the torta that was the real disappointment.  The sandwhich had some weird spread on the top of it that just wasn't pleasant.  The black bean spread on the bottom was fine and the steak itself was fine.  But the mush (and it was mushy) on top was a no go.  I ended up after two bites just eating the steak and abandoning hte rest of hte sandwhich.",0.8749,0.816,0.113,0.071,0.5938644688644689
2015-05-05,3.0,"Went last Saturday in the afternoon, and it was busy.  The entire room inside was full, and all of the outdoor seating was also occupied.  Because of this the kitchen was running a bit behind, and food was coming out slowly.  The decor was nice, and helped divert my attention from the slow food.  The place is a few months old, but still has that new and shiny feel to it, and all the servers smiled and were courteous.  Prices are great for Gold Coast, a nice plus.  I do wonder if the owner is affiliated with Mercadito on Kinzie since the menus look extremely similar. Drinks are strong, useful to help alleviate any hangovers.  The margarita tradicional is pretty standard, I recommend getting the Little Market instead since it tastes somewhat similar and has a bit more flavor kick to it.  Flavored mimosas however didn't have much flavor, I couldn't taste any peach, mango, or guava. Food overall was plated well, but taste was average.  French toast looked nice, pancakes looked nice, chilaquiles looked nice, but only the enchiladas were good enough for me to want to order them again. So a decent place for weekend brunch with a hangover, but the food did not stand out enough to warrant going any other time.",0.9959,0.763,0.237,0.0,0.5144781144781145
2015-05-04,3.0,"Tried a variety of items with my fiance while at Mercadito Kitchen. Let me first say, the ambiance and decor is really nice. There is a sizable area outside where many folks sat eating brunch, but we sat in the large indoor dining room. It was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. Drinks were great (strong!). The mango and peach mimosas are a tasty treat! My fiance had their margarita which he enjoyed. Those drinks were the highlight! We tried three dishes: the french toast with berries, enchiladas, and breakfast tacos. French Toast- A solid B. Nothing extraordinary, but very tasty. A little too sweet for breakfast to me! Enchiladas- C/C+. They were fine, and cooked well. The tortillas tasted totally homemade, and the chicken was great. But the sauce realllllllllly left something to be desired. It tasted generic and really lacked anything special. I would have appreciated a little kick of heat in that sauce! Breakfast Tacos- A. These were yummy! Again, the homemade tortilla really improved the situation.  Overall the food was nicely presented, with a good use of garnishes and a mix of fresh berries, fresh avocado, and onion to add texture and flavor to warm dishes. I'd come here again to give it another go, but mostly for the drinks!",0.998,0.683,0.317,0.0,0.49351851851851847
2015-04-29,3.0,"We came here as the second night to ""girls night."" We ordered the house margaritas to the start night, let's just say they didn't taste too good.... Our table that we had made reservations for was not there when we arrived 10 minutes early and instead sat 30 minutes later. I get it busy Saturday night... Not sure. Our server when we sat down immediately recognized that our drinks were not touched and offered to get a different round of drinks on house... Now we're getting started. My friends ordered taco and I got veggie quesadillas. Nothing really felt ""amazing."" I'm sure I've had better drinks at a different bar. However, the 3 stars is for the service for really trying to make up the evening. Who knows maybe we will return.",0.8625,0.921,0.079,0.0,0.4444444444444445
2015-04-02,4.0,"I'm pretty sure the new name is Mercadito Kitchen. I was a little confused by the actual name and concept since I first thought it was Mercadito Fish and then saw few seafood dishes on the menu. They might want to try to push this new name a little harder to avoid confusion. I went with a group of girls, one who knows the manager. He was very gracious, stopping by to say hello and bringing a number of appetizers on the house for us to sample (guac and chips, flautas and then something I didn't quite get the name of but looked like empanadas). They were all OK. None blew me away, but I would get the chips and guacamole again. I had the chile relleno, which was quite good. It was not breaded and fried like most chile rellenos are, but it had lots of delicious cheese and shrimp inside. The rice and beans that came with it were quite flavorful, which was a nice surprise since these are often throwaway side dishes. At $22.50 I thought the price was a little steep, but it was filling. I also had the traditional margarita, which was very strong. Yay for bang for your buck, but a miss on the flavor profile. Overall, I give this a 3.5 star review. Good service and easy street parking. It's a little pricey for what it is, and there are many good upscale Mexican restaurants in Chicago, so the field is already crowded. They might need to try something that sets them apart from places like Cantina Laredo and Frontera Grill.",0.9949,0.775,0.2,0.025,0.5247399925177703

2015-03-22,3.0,"Brunch impressions- totally empty restaurant on a Saturday 11am... The food- aside from some breakfast basics, there was not much seafood on the menu, and pretty much very similar items (guac, salsa, ceviche) that are served at mercadito (the original). Had the salmon Benedict which wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've had. They no longer have lobster rolls on the menu. The Bloody Mary was good but again not amazing. I don't think I will be coming back. Overall impression is not that great. Service was decent. Parking is valet next door by the hotel for 4 hours $15...",-0.9122,0.723,0.098,0.179,0.5168888888888888
