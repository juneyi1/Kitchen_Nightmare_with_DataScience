Don't order lettuce on your burger, if you do you are subjected  to a huge chunk of thick dry lettuce leaves with the core still attached.  The fries are absolutely dreadful: fried within an inch of their lives... tasteless unseasoned sticks. Although I think sticks might have been tastier to eat.  Milkshakes are good as the drinks selection. The music is way too loud... the curse of overly confident average restaurants that sell fast food.",0.7584,0.795,0.139,0.066,0.6538888888888889

2017-08-22,4.0,"My friend and I happened upon Small Cheval while wandering from our Airbnb in Bucktown on our first day in Chicago. I'd heard great things about the original Au Cheval and was excited to try the famed burger with less hassle (especially since there were few restaurant options on the stretch of Milwaukee Ave we'd walked). The inside is simple and cute, and the menu is equally minimal. The order line and the food service were both quick, and our burgers, fries, and shakes arrived quickly. The burger, of course, was great--hearty, plenty of cheese sauce, topped with nice pickles and tomatoes. The shake was rich AF and perfect to wash it down with. The fries weren't quite as crispy as I like, but still good. I'm curious to see how it would all stack up to the original! We also wanted to take advantage of their cheap shots, but alas it was too early in the day. Next time!",0.963,0.813,0.164,0.023,0.6040013227513228

We arrived around 615 PM on a Saturday night and there was a line out the door, though we expected as much.  We waited for about 30 minutes and then got to the front and ordered from their simple menu: cheeseburger or hamburger (""housestyle"" with dijionnaise, pickles, and onions), fries, and a large cocktail menu to order from... or in our case, milkshakes (vanilla or chocolate available, and you can add a shot of a number of liquors into it). There was some seating on the inside, though it was dark and not particularly cozy. Everyone was headed to the large outdoor patio and we followed suit. We found a spot at one of the many long tables available. The food came out relatively fast - within 10-15 minutes.

I like their burgers very much, but I also do not think they're the best burgers out there (see my review of Au Cheval). My belief that this place is a little hyped remains unchanged.  Nonetheless, the food/drink hit the spot for me. I had the cheeseburger plus bacon, the fries, and a cup of Founders. After a week of traveling, nothing screams ""Chicago!!"" in your ears like a good old American cheeseburger that you can get at Cheval.

I liked the chewy bun of the burger though! There was a nice patio area for people to share tables and eat under cute lights, with the cta train passing every now and then. The line also moves really efficiently so I wouldn't stress if you see a lot of people trailing out of the restaurant.

2017-08-09,4.0,"TLDR: Small Cheval: A Redemption Story. Simple burgers, AIOLI, (optional boozy) rich milkshakes.  I was not a fan of au cheval. At all. (See previous review about au cheval) So, I was extremely reluctant to try small cheval as it was going to be as salty as au cheval in my head. But I decided to give it a chance after seeing some fellow yelpers that didn't like au cheval say small cheval was better, and I'm glad I did! Small cheval is located in a cool part of bucktown/wicker park. It's a small standalone brick building, matching the aesthetic of its location. We went down for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, and I expected the worst. Au cheval boasts 5 hour waits on the weekends, but small cheval had a small line out the door that zoomed by quickly (10-15 min wait tops). The menu itself is pretty simple with the choice of a cheeseburger, hamburger, and fries. The restaurant boasts tons of alcohol choices and option for boozy milkshakes. I got a cheeseburger house style with a side of fries and a chocolate milkshake...a little pricy coming to a total of about $18. After another short 10 min wait or so, the food came out piping hot. First thing to note, the burgers are all double patties, so they're pretty hearty. There isn't anything too fancy about the burger as it comes pretty bare, even with the pickle and condiments added when you get it house style. But it's a pretty damn good burger. Second, the fries were crisp and given in a large quantity. GET THE AIOLI WITH YOUR FRIES, you will NOT regret it. If I could put that aioli on all my food for the rest of my life, I would not be upset. Third, the milkshake was thick and rich, the whipped cream on top adding a nice fluffy topping.  It started to get busier after we sat down to eat, and we noticed a cool patio out back to eat. Overall, the burger was a nice and solid, albeit pricy, meal that satisfied my burger craving in a way that au cheval did not. It was not over salted or over seasoned, and I appreciated the raw simplicity of small cheval. It almost makes me want to go back and give au cheval another chance.........almost.",0.9928,0.818,0.147,0.035,0.48892000093923177

I suggested this location with a group of friends after our hearts were set on that of who shall not be named. To avoid over an hour to two and a half hour wait on a Sunday, we decided to try lil bro instead after much much word around town. To reiterate, if you're looking for the similar to spot on version, it's not here. Although the style is similar with a double patty, the bacon(extra 2.00) is NOT pork belly and just all around a good/more decent burger.  Don't get me wrong, it was a great burger in a fast food style sit down location. Service was friendly and the price was still relatively high, but I am firm believer in getting what you pay for, and this meat, is quality all day.  If we must do comparisons I'll say it's a step below big bro and a step above Five Guys. It'll do the trick for a burger fixing and booshie budget when you just don't have 2 hours to wait at their counterpart.  My friends were impressed considering the nick of time we had. However, I kept getting the, ""it wasn't the same, it just wasn't the same."" Okay, it's NOT the same. But can you honestly duplicate perfection? I digress.

Honestly, there isn't much more to ask for. The burgers are delicious and you have unlimited access to delicious condiments including garlic aioli, special ketchup, regular Heinz ketchup, and mustard. The garlic aioli is by far my favorite part. Delicious on the burger but also a great dipping option for the fries.  Overall, one of my new favorite spots in Wicker Park.

This spinoff of the big brother full-service restaurant is smaller yet still serves a dynamite burger...albeit not a cheap one.  At $10, 'inexpensive' isn't a word I'd use to describe their succulent double cheeseburger, but holy smokes does it hit the spot after logging a few solid hours of pinball at the nearby Emporium barcade. Beer, burgers (with or without cheese--bacon is an extra $2), fries, shakes.  And that's it!  You really don't need much more since the burger prepared house-style (pickles, grilled onions, dijonaise) is more than enough to quell those drunk, late night hunger pangs. Patio is cute.  My Bell's draft was $7, which is steep but I was elated to see my preferred beer of choice on tap.  I didn't have time for the fries or a shake, but rest assured I'll hit those up on my return visit as I definitely plan on coming back.

The patties are thin with a nice crisp to them and the melted cheese is generous but not overwhelming. The buns are fresh and the condiments are nothing exotic, only what you would expect. This is everything a cheese burger is supposed to be and at a reasonable price. Simply an all-American classic executed to perfection.

Good thing, cos we were all drunk. All of us were truly blown away by the burgers. AND the fries. We were just so impressed with how amazing these burgers are. AMAZING.

Small Cheval's menu is 3 items - Hamburger, Cheeseburger, and French Fries.  Condiments consist of Dijonnaise, Finely chopped red onion, and pickle.  You may also order lettuce and tomato (not listed), and add $2 for bacon.  All burgers are two 1/4 lb patties. For what sounded like a flat top, the patties were cooked perfectly.  Adding mustard and ketchup helped cut down on the plain greasy taste.  Although they were well done, it was still juicy.  The french fries were not overdone, and crispy, and tasted amazing with ketchup. It is very affordable.  and they're seating is plentiful.  Inside communal table, looks to sit 20? and they also have bars lining the exterior walls, with outdoor seating as well.  Not many things wroung with Small Cheval.  Only thing I'd recommend is an option to lightly toast buns.",0.991,0.792,0.178,0.031,0.40837962962962965

With Small Cheval I've heard the hype, seen the long lines, and now finally got to see what it was all about.  Going into this restaurant, you must understand and appreciate the simplistic nature of the menu, ingredients, and atmosphere. Your not going to a 5 star restaurant asking for burger option toppings, no selection of ridiculous cheeses, ridiculous additional toppings like Mac N Cheese, chicken fingers, or pulled pork,  which beg the question is it still a burger, or even how do you want it cooked for that matter. Again appreciate the simplistic nature of the burger, the fact that your standing in line, and your not making reservations.  I went for the cheeseburger, comes with dual patties, Kraft Cheese, homemade dijonnaise, pickles and onion, on a plain buttered bun. I originally thought is this better than a 1/2 lb burger, medium with pepper jack, bacon, etc.... by the time I was done thinking I had eaten the entire burger. This may not be the best burger I've ever had, but it's the Perfect burger! Consistent bite after bite, cheese, meat, bun, sauce, and it was really good to a point I wanted to jump back in line for another!  And the fries, if you don't like these fries, don't come here then, shorter lines for me next time. The fries are ridiculous, get some Kensington ketchup or aioli garlic sauce you won't be disappointed. I will be back.  Simple, fast, and bottom line delicious.

2017-03-05,4.0,"Let me just start by saying that I've not yet been to Au Cheval, so this isn't a comparison review, simply a straightforward opinion on this little burger joint.  Hubby and I were on our way home yesterday after a long, atypically stressful round of events for a Saturday. We were hungry and the thought of cooking or even browsing our freezer contents was a no-go. We needed comfort food and it had to be in the area. Throwing all caution to the wind, we decided to finally give Small Cheval a try, knowing full well that we might regret it due to the potential weekend lines.  We walked in at around 6:30, and we couldn't quite open the second inner door just yet due to the crowd. Neither one of us were willing to back out though, so we kept our knowing glances to ourselves. Surprisingly, it only took about ten minutes to find ourselves at the front of the line, and hubs ordered the house-style bacon cheeseburger while I opted for a hamburger, pickle only, and chose to slather one of their in house ketch-ups (not the Heinz) and the garlic aioli on my burger. We both ordered a shake and fries to complete our meals & were happily on our way home within maybe 15-20 mins tops! (Yes we decided to be gluttonous in the comfort of our own home as it's mere blocks away.)  We got home and dug in immediately. Hubby was so delighted with his bacon cheeseburger and kept remarking how awesome the cheese was. I had to sneak a bite, despite my aversion to onions, and I had to agree the they make a killer cheeseburger. I wasn't envious however, as my personal concoction of the house made ketchup, garlic aioli, and their awesome thin sliced pickles were the perfect combination for the burger! The meat patties were cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and pink and juicy on the inside. Im all of 5' tall and I almost inhaled that entire burger. The fries were crispy and salty, even after the short car ride home, and just delicious dipped in the ketchup, aioli, or both - that said, the portion is huge, and we could've shared, especially with the generous burgers! The shakes were thick and creamy with an almost malt-like quality, which I love, and against my better judgement, I finished about 1/3 of mine before my tummy protested too much. I'm looking forward to revisiting that goodie in the freezer!  All in all, this place has such a small menu because they do everything to perfection, and with an effortlessly pleasant & speedy service. Props to people who eat in, as I was an unforgiving, greasy, and oh-so-delighted mess!",0.9946,0.823,0.141,0.036,0.5621212121212121

We waited in line for 20 mins last Sunday during the gorgeous warm February weather we're weirdly having. Everyone chatted excitedly in line about either A. How good it is or B. How good they expect it to be. When we finally got in the doorway, hubs grabbed 4 stools facing a window while the rest of us placed orders. I got a cheeseburger, homestyle (but no onion!), add bacon, fries, and a chocolate shake. Hubs got the same only +onion, and vanilla shake. The crew we were with got similar orders. One got a beer. The line moved quickly and easily and the guy taking our orders and money was cool without pretension, friendly without glomming on us, and very efficient. We got our buzzers and made our way to the condiment table. TWO kinda of ketchup! GARLIC AIOLI! COME ON. I loaded up on both and sat down to wait. A mere 10 mins later, our food was ready. We dug in immediately. Fries were salty, crispy, deliciousness and especially incredible with the garlic aioli. Then... the burger. THE BURGER. Crispy thin double patties, gooey melty cheesy, juicy delicious beef. Omg. Easily one of my top 3 burgers of all time. SO GOOD. Then after sufficiently stuffing myself with burger, I enjoyed the rich, creamy, thick milkshake. Again, amazing, and even more so with the dollop of real amazing whipped cream on top!

2017-02-04,4.0,"Pretty Good. not quite as good as Au Cheval but obviously the wayy shorter wait time  (I only waited 5 min for my burger) and cheaper prices ($10.95+ $3.50 for bacon at au cheval vs $9.95 + $2 for bacon) made up for the difference in quality. The restaurant has a cool, laid back vibe where you can seat yourself on a giant community table or on a bar stool and pick up your food at the counter when it is ready. I actually liked the atmosphere more than Au cheval because it wasn't as dark and crowded.  Overall, I could definitely see the difference between Au Cheval and Small Cheval (the bacon was just plain bacon while Au Cheval has thick maple glazed bacon), the bun at Au Cheval was more firm and held it's shape more while Small Cheval's bun was more like a fast food burger bun. Honestly, I think I would have liked this place more if the burgers were a few dollars cheaper because it definitely did not seem like a $12 burger. However, this burger is definitely beyond a normal In-n-out or other fast food burgers- I think the secret is in the meat to cheese to bun ratio- all the flavors were really balanced in each bite.  The fries were a lot cheaper here than Au Cheval- fries are $5.95 at Au Cheval while $2.95 here and they tasted just like the fries from Au Cheval- super crispy on the outside, fluffy potato on the inside- I could get a giant bucket of those and a pint of the garlic aioli and have that be my diet for the rest of the month!",0.9937,0.829,0.165,0.006,0.5295739348370928

2016-12-25,3.0,"Here's the million dollar question. How does this place compare to Au Cheval? I think Au Cheval is better.  But here's the other question: if you are in Chicago for a visit and you want to visit Au Cheval or Small Cheval, which should you go to? In other words, is Small Cheval similar enough that you can forgo that long ass wait at Au Cheval? If you are in Chicago for a brief period of time and want to try the famous Au Cheval burger that has topped all those best cheeseburger in America lists, do not come here. Go to Au Cheval and wait.  Because the burgers at this place are just not as good, and not similar enough to Au Cheval that you'd get close to the Au Cheval experience.   Why? The burger here has the double patties, but that's where the similarities stop for me.  The bacon at Au Cheval is much better, and they also let you add an egg to the Au Cheval burger.  One reason I love Au Cheval so much is because of that bacon.  Without it, it's basically just a decent cheeseburger without anything special. Add that egg, and to me you have the perfectly prepared ingredients that make up the perfect burger.  Also, Au Cheval has better side dishes, where you can add egg on your fries. Note that the fries themselves are otherwise are the same across both restaurants.  This place is basically a burger stand.  Very casual, where you go up to the counter and order your burger and then sit down at a big table or at one of the counter tables and eat your burger.  It is pretty no fuss and no frills.  You get your burger pretty quickly.  The cheeseburger here is $9.95, with $2 extra for bacon.  The hamburger is a dollar less, at $8.95.  Fries are around $2 for one serving, which can be shared between two people.  Probably one order of fries is good per two people, unless you are really hungry.  As a comparison, the cheeseburger at Au Cheval is $10.95 with an additional $3.50 for bacon.   The one thing I thought was pretty cool about this place is that they let you get alcohol.  For example, you can add bailey's to your milkshake. To me, because I no longer live in Chicago - I would just go wait in line at Au Cheval for that burger because there is nothing like it to me (not even at Small Cheval).  If you live in Chicago though, this is a fast and decent cheeseburger.",0.9885,0.831,0.119,0.05,0.5077719705768486

There was virtually no wait here.  I didn't realize it when we decided to come here, but Small Cheval's burgers are actually smaller than the original that swept Chicagoland. They offer the same two patties, but much thinner bacon and no egg. I truly feel I'm going to die after eating at Au Cheval, so I found this equally delicious version of their burger preferable. It allowed me to also indulge in some fries and a shake, and walk away without worrying that my stomach would explode.

Ive always heard amazing things about Au Cheval's famous 'best in the us' burger so expectations were high. tdlr: Good place to bring large group of rich drunk friends on a friday night for an unusually creamy/overall meh burger and drinks. Come if you like mayonnaise. Get a shake. Cute atmosphere. Overpriced/overrated Burger: Single cheeseburger (2 patties) come out to a bit above $10 with tax and comes with dijonnaise, red onions, and pickles  The meat on the burger itself was nothing special and formed into thin patties cooked medium. The patties did have a decent crust on them and black pepper pepper on both sides (both are signs that they know what theyre doing) The cheese was between the patties (nice!) and on top of the meat. They used yellow american cheese which adds no taste (american cheese sucks and isnt cheese) but is melty  Bun was only a little sweet (good), quality, and came toasted Dijonnaise was REALLY piled on there and only tasted like mayonnaise with no dijon kick/contrast with the rest of the burger. I did think it was a nice that the red onions were chopped instead of sliced. Im not a fan of sweet pickles so I got my burger without them, and since theyre sweet I dont think theyd provide much contrast and would just be lost in the overwhelming creaminess Overall burger had very little/no contrast (taste or textural). If you have to add expensive bacon or a fried egg to a burger (recommendations i always see for au cheval) for it to taste good youre doing it wrong I didnt order the fries since they didnt look like anything special. The shakes did look really good and were a fair size for the price (considering the priceiness of the burger and basically everything else here) The staff here are very kind, have a good attitude, and move quickly and efficiently. The place itself is pretty cute if you care about that stuff (I honestly only care about food). Theyre open late and have a large patio with picnic tables and pretty string lights.

I've now been to Au Cheval 4 times and Small twice and really don't understand what the Au Cheval fuss is about. Now that I've had both burgers within a week of each other, I can confidently say the Small burger is superior to the Au burger. Something about the patties, the flavor, and the buns. Both times I've been to Small Cheval I've been in burger heaven, and all times I've been to Au Cheval, I've left pretty underwhelmed.

Just eat the slab of meat since you can't taste anything else anyways. I digress. These are basic ingredient burgers but everything tastes very good together. The cheese is gooey, the pickle is refreshing, the dijonaisse is unique. I really enjoyed their fries and the ketchup and garlic aioli they have.

This is no In-N-Out $3 (or so) double-double, so there should not be any comparison to begin with. This is a completely different price point at about $10 for a burger.

2016-07-28,4.0,"3.5 stars based on food alone but bumping up to 4 stars because I like the simplistic concept of the restaurant itself. The burger was definitely solid but I wish there was a little something extra in terms of flavor, either directly in the meat patties or with some sort of sauce. I say this only as someone from LA who holds In N Out burgers in the highest regard. Cheese was delicious and the bun was good too, although I would have preferred a little extra crispness on the inside of the bun. The fries here are spectacular. I just wish the kitchen had made them ready at the same time as the burger because I had to wait like ten minutes after my burger was ready to actually get my fries. Considering they only make two things here, burgers and fries, the timing on this really should not have been an issue. The place was not super crowded at the time, but I'll give them a pass on this, maybe they were down a fryer or something, who knows. The vanilla shake was tasty and I was delighted by the option to add baileys to it to make it an adult shake. Every place should do this. All in all, this is a good choice when you just want to sit down and enjoy the basics of a good burger, fries and drink without any fuss.",0.9925,0.766,0.197,0.037,0.4642094017094017

2016-07-21,5.0,"My favorite place when I just want a burger. This cheeseburger is my favorite. The flavors are perfect and the way it all just melts together is out of this world.  This place gets tough criticism because of its older brother. I will agree with everyone else that it's just not the same as Au Cheval. However, to me this fixes the craving without the crazy wait...and it's designed as a quick order and eat place so they are just on totally different levels. When you arrive here you will just jump right in line to the counter where you'll place your order and be given a buzzer. The buzzer goes off when your food is ready :) It should be noted that they only offer hamburgers and cheeseburgers here, but I did hear the person in front of me ordering a ""kids burger"" so it sounds like they have a smaller portion for the little ones.  This last Saturday when I visited, it was a little busy, so a server was walking through the line serving drinks if you wanted to order. This was awesome. What a nice touch. I ordered the Seattle Cider on draft and it was crisp and refreshing.  Let's talk food. The cheeseburger. So good. This is definitely an eat it right then and there kind of burger. I can't imagine it would be as good as take out if you're going very far. The first time I visited here my cousin and I split a burger. This only lead to me wishing I had my own burger. You probably need your own burger at this place :) IMO it's dressed perfectly house style, but here you have more flexibility with toppings contrary to its big brother Au Cheval. The fries are also crispy, delicious and well priced. Only 2.95 for a side of fries and my fiancé and I always just split one order. I also love that the condiments are self serve here, hello garlic aioli!  In my book Small Cheval is exactly what I've been looking for.

Great burger.  See?

I did mention to him why (maybe should've) but...he was gracious and didn't mind me grabbing our food our own once it became ready for pick up.

2016-06-26,5.0,"Just went to Small Cheval for lunch an hour ago. It was our second time here, and I just had to put in a five star review for this place! I am not a huge burger person, but after we came here two weeks ago, I really craved their cheeseburger this afternoon! I'm officially hooked on the Small Cheval burgers! Food: Their menu is super simple, which I love! - Hamburger - Cheeseburger - add bacon - Fries - Milkshakes - A limited bar Cheeseburger: I haven't had their hamburger but their cheeseburger is the way to go. It's double patties, and they melt the cheese all over the patty, and the buns are toasted on the grill. Their ""house style"" includes this dijyonnaise sauce with some red onions - I love it that way, I recommend it. I also dunk my burger in the special ketchup and it's amazing! Sauces: They also have two kinds of ketchup, garlic aioli, and mustard. I recommend the garlic aioli and the ketchup thats not the Heinz kind - taste more salty and less sweet compared to the heinz. French fries: They make the french fries out of fresh california potatoes. They are thicker cut and cooked just the right amount, not greasy, just crispy on the outside and moist in the inside. The Garlic Aioli tastes amazing with the french fries. Shakes: Recommend the vanilla - they use good quality ice cream, you can see the vanilla bean dots in the shake - super yummy! Comes piled with whipped cream. They also have chocolate for the chocolate lovers - but I haven't tried that myself. Atmosphere: Inside the restaurant is extremely small. The real deal is sitting outside in their patio. It's much bigger than it seems from across the street, lots of big wooden bench chairs to be used community/family style. It's a great atmosphere, with nice lights and lots of people hanging out. It's very child friendly too - see a lot of people with baby carts as they can just put it next to the table.",0.9976,0.762,0.207,0.031,0.39492481203007523

Add bacon. Yep. That is it. But oh that is where it begins.  The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The bun is deliciously soft but holds up under the two patties and cheese that is oozing over the edges. The bacon is a perfect addition! However, skip the house mayo. Fries are perfectly crisp and fresh with each having slightly different textures. The flavoring is not pronounced so don't expect a heavy salt or upscale flavoring. Just good ol fashion, perfectly done fries. Drinks are out of can (grab from cooler), from the tap, or from the milk shake shaker. Seating inside or outside.  The price is heavy but I'll pay for it with these burgers! They are a five star place if the cost was a bit lower. 4 because of cost. Tips 1. Garlic aioli is wonderful on fries 2. It is two patties 3. Save the dessert and head around the corner to Margie's Candies 4. Cheese is great - do it! 5. Bacon is wonderful! 6. Fries are a tweener in terms of size for one or two people.

It seems to me that the burger here is in the *spirit* of Au Cheval's, but isn't quite the same. The whole thing is a little more orderly, a little more assembly-lined, and has just a hint of fast-food about it.  It's still an extremely good burger, the pickles and sauce and bun are still very nicely done, but you are a little more likely to think about it competing with Shake Shack. One other difference from Au Cheval is that you can't get an egg on your burger here.  I'm not sure they should keep ""Cheval"" in the name if they're not going to go around sticking eggs on things, but I guess frying eggs to order would destroy their ability to turn these things out at high speed.

2016-05-26,3.0,"The highlights are pretty much the patio and the bun, as the burger was just average for me. The location is pretty cool - situated on a corner, with a simple & open interior and a secluded garden-style patio that is actually larger than the interior. But, this is a burger joint - so the food is what counts. While the burger was well cooked, especially for thin patties - it was entirely, entirely over seasoned. The overwhelming strong presence of salt was the primary flavor, which unfortunately didn't let the beef shine. I'm sad to say what I ate was essentially a nice & juicy cheesy salt-patty. The bun was by far my favorite part, and the savior of the experience. It would be a good sandwich to have for a late afternoon snack when you're having a late dinner - but double up on the water cups! The place was quick - both in paying and in preparing the food, and they had some good tunes playing while I waited. But, since the food was mediocre and, per other reviews here on Yelp, there is supposedly a better version of their food elsewhere, I would just recommend checking the original Au Cheval. Given the high praise for this concept, I'll have to reserve judgment until I conclude Chicagoans just don't know a good burger - but this was mostly a let-down, unless salty Shake Shack was the goal.",0.9866,0.813,0.166,0.021,0.6685434173669469

It was running around behind the potted plants within the patio area. It destroyed any appetite we previously had. This brings my review to 3.5-stars.  2) Attitude. When I got up to the counter to order a drink, I ordered a straight vodka, which they don't carry (?). So I asked how big the house drinks were. The guy explained it was ""a 5 oz pour."" Cool man.. I don't really know how much that is (I don't think the average person has a really good sense of how much that is..). So I ask how much that fills in the cup - he got flustered and shrugged - which did not help me answer the question. To be fair, he didn't raise his voice or anything, but I was out with a friend and it was embarrassing for me to ask to begin with. So it only drops the review by half-star.

Here's why: - it's perfectly cooked, with the teensiest of pink remaining - the buns are not an afterthought: they complement the burger and toppings, and don't collapse. Also: are they glazed with butter? I don't know if I want to know the answer to this question, but also: YUM - get it 'house style' with pickles et al. Trust. Just do it. There are three options: hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon cheeseburger. Not to get all Goldilocks-y but I think the hamburger benefits from the cheese, the bacon is gilding the lily too much and so: the cheeseburger reigns supreme here.  The fries are an afterthought in this review (DEM BURGS THO) but really aren't second fiddle at Small Cheval: they are deliciously crisp, perfectly seasoned, skin-on taters. You should go for 'em.

Only serving burgers, fries, shakes, and boozy adult beverages at a marginally smaller size, but doing it oh-so-well. Went here around noon on Sunday for brunch. And just a word of advice: please if you wake up early enough, get there before 12:30 pm, because this small place fills up pretty rapidly. We had new patrons hovering and hawking our corner spot like a predatory bird waiting for mice, prior to leaving. Yikes!  I got the cheeseburger, and my S.O. got the cheeseburger + bacon, tomato, and lettuce for $2 extra. We shared an order of Golden Fries and had two hair o' the dog as well. The cheeseburger at its base had two perfectly griddled beef patties cooked to Medium (my favorite cook for burgers/arguably the best! Thanks, Small Cheval!), a quick smear of dijoinaise, a smattering of minced red onions, a handful of tangy pickles, and melty, gooey American cheese. As for the double-fried Golden Fries, they were so mouth-shattering good. Like as soon as you bite into it, a nice crispy crunch would yield. A pitch-perfect amount of salt on it, too. Reminded me so much of Hot Doug's duck fat fries. R.I.P. Hot Doug's  :-( My only -- and I mean only complaint -- is that their use of the all-natural Sir Kensington's ketchup for their fries was just a touch too grainy and reminded me of flavored tomato paste.

The vanilla shake was good.  I'll try the cheeseburger again when I'm in the area and I'm craving a burger but, this is not a destination site. The flavor and size of the cheeseburger with bacon don't live up to its price. At twelve dollars, I shouldn't have to open my cheeseburger to make sure they didn't forget the bacon. No lettuce and tomato in this cheeseburger. Not an option on the menu either. Maybe it was on a secret menu. Anyway, a nice juicy slice of tomato would have improved this cheeseburger as it was a bit dry and tolerably salty. Next time I'll add some of that garlic aioli and see if it tastes better. Hopefully it won't make it saltier. That would suck.  The music inside was good. Maybe if I ate inside instead of having it to go I would feel better about the value. Nah, I'm there for the food.  If the burger sucks who cares if the music is any good. A good example of this is Burger Belly (previously Lead Belly).  For those of you that rated this burger five stars and said it was the best burger you've ever had, please get out and try more burger places.

Now get out there and continue your quest for the end all be all of burgers, I did.

Sounds great in theory but after the first bite, I realized that the burger at Small Cheval didn't have the pure awesomeness and enchantment from David Blaine's demon magic at Au Cheval. The fries (cooked in animal lard) were still amazing but the burger wasn't quite at the same level.  Overall, it's still a great burger for $10.

The burger is darn tasty.  It has two beef patties, delicious cheese, the dijonnaise, pickles and some onions. The burger is so juicy and the bun can stand up to it. The bacon is thinner than the original and provides more of a crunch and texture to the burger. The fries are also good and easily shareable. They were crispy but yet soft inside and you got to taste the potato. Of course, they have the famous garli aioli for dipping. If you want to experiment, there are also other sauces available too.  Small Cheval is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat without the notorious 2 hour waits Au Cheval is now has.  So far, the most I've had to wait is about 10 minutes and got a seat by the time food was ready.  It is also a completely different experience with communal tables and has more of an ""in and out"" than ""stay and hang out"" vibe.  I definitely can't wait until it is nice enough to check out the patio. The staff are helpful and friendly.  Make no mistake: this is not the original Au Cheval burger and if you are looking for that, you might be disappointed.  However, there are similarities and overall, it is still a very, very good burger.  In fact, my husband prefers the small cheval burger.

The burgers are worth the wait on the weekends when it gets busy. While you can only choose your standard hamburger/cheeseburger and there's not much to add besides bacon, they are juicy, flavorful, and incredible.

I had every intention of sharing my fries, but that didn't happen.  Initially, I wasn't sure if I liked them as they were very well done, but they have a great crunch and that definitely grew on me.  I'm convinced it's the chunks of sea salt that makes them super addicting.  My only warning is to watch how many times you come back!",0.982,0.715,0.227,0.058,0.4929012345679013

Prices are basically $1 or so less than that of Au Cheval. But there's not much of a wait because it's a order at the counter and find a seat yourself type of place. Seating is quite interesting... there are seats around the edges of the small restaurant, and then a huge table in the middle. It can get busy, but I came with 2 friends on a Friday night and only had to wait 10 min for seats.  The burgers of course taste great! I mean, if that's the only thing they make, it better taste amazing. The meat was juicy and chewy. The fries were real potatoes but way too salty. And the smoothie was pretty good - I got the vanilla one. It's pretty smooth and creamy. My friend did mention that the chocolate one doesn't really taste too strongly of chocolate though. I got a burger with fries and a milkshake, which came out to $18.  There's usually street parking available on Milwaukee.",0.9927,0.792,0.208,0.0,0.5911458333333334

So the burger is simple but very well executed. Brioche bun, perfectly cooked, pickles, cheese, onions and dijonaisse. Very tasty, the dijonaisse really makes it. I added bacon, because its bacon, that's extra. Fries were good, fresh cut done well and crunchy. I was on lunch from work so a can of pop, fine. But almost $20! They're getting four stars based on a tasty burger, but I have a hard time paying that when it was not the best burger I've ever had. It's up there, but I've had a better burger that cost me less.

The fries were average and taste alot better with the garlic aioli(may be spelled wrong!) The order taker was trained well but sorry to say no eggs on the burger???  The ketchup and mustard were also tasty and were not the commons HEINZ brand. due to the lack of space a giant table was set in the middle of the place and if you come with a big group conversation will work if you speak loudly. a self serve water station with cups sat on the side if you don't feel like drinking overpriced tap beer.

2016-01-17,5.0,"""Mmmmm, this is a tasty burger!"" Jules Winnfield, Pulp Fiction. I can leave my review at just that.  Because really, if the burger can't stand alone, it's not worth a visit.  But I can talk a lot if you give me the space, so here I am, taking up the space. The Cheeseburger cooked to medium (you all should know by now that the regular cheeseburger is really two patties) is super flavorful, with just enough grease to make it indulgent. That's why I ask for lettuce and tomato so at least I get some veggies in.   You can ask for a single patty cheeseburger too, but why do that, unless you're ordering for your kid...and take it from my 4 year old, he loves their cheeseburgers too.  Their golden french fries are perfectly crispy and are a great vehicle for the garlic aioli...which is self-serve pump by the way, get some for the burger or your fries or both.  Trust.  My husband likes the house grainy mustard (also self-serve pump), it can add a vinegary element to your burger/fries and quite good too.  What else can round out a burger and fries but a milk shake, or better yet a boozy milk shake.   I have yet to try a boozy shake, but tried the regular chocolate shake and that was good.  I do also love the craft cocktails here too.   The patio is one of my favorites for lunch in the summer.  The planted greenery make nice walls to block out Milwaukee Ave's traffic noise. And there's plenty of seating.  Service is nice.  Super casual spot with elevated diner style burgers.  I've not been to Au Cheval yet.  When I vist I guess I can compare the burgers.  But really it doesn't matter, let's give a shout out to the little sibling.

But I had always heard amazing things about Cheval's burgers, so I was glad to pay this spot a visit with my friend during lunch hour. I had a cheeseburger with fries. I swallowed the cheeseburger and will have to go there again to remember whether the fries are worth writing home about. I remember the garlic aioli dip was to die for. It's quite pricey, but it's a damn good burger. There was harmony between the bun, the meat, the cheese, and simple condiments. Thank God it's a bit out of the way, as a line for lunch hour is pretty deep as it is. Outdoor seating is a plus, giving it a laid-back ambiance. The staff there seemed pretty upbeat.

2015-11-29,4.0,"It was just another day at work, and I needed adventure. Time for a lunch break. It was cold and windy, almost too cold for the walk I made to Small Cheval, but nothing prepared me for the shift between atmospheres once I walked in the door. Holiday season was full throttle, drinks were being had, and connections were being made. It was the older clientele that threw me off. No one in here seemed unattractive to me, but then again, Parallel Lines by Junior Boys was pumping through their sound system. A song I hadn't heard since my apartment was robbed, and all my music was taken away. Even the staff seemed sexual. As the track switched to Feel it All Around, by Washed Out, I knew I was right. This place not only cranks out excellent cheeseburgers, they are sexual cheeseburgers. I'm not gonna lie, I was a little intimidated about not knowing what I was getting myself into. I stepped up to the counter and the man at the register already had that look on his face that said, ""We only like customers who know what they want."" I didn't know what I wanted. I had never been here before, and I tried to put on my best face that said, ""Be patient with me. It's my first time."" It felt like they were about to rob me of the last piece of innocence I had. Once I had that burger in my mouth, I enjoyed every minute of it.   They made me wait. While I waited, I felt my anticipation grow. Or was it my anxiety picking up being surrounded in such a small space by sexual holiday foodies? I couldn't tell. My emotions were all over the place. I finally found my second wind of confidence and began to look around the restaurant. Along with the Richard Geres (circa early '90s) in puffy Columbia Jackets (ribbed for your pleasure), I began to relax as I noticed maybe 2 other normal people, being painfully normal. A young couple, oblivious to their surroundings, trapped in their bubble of heteronormative lifestyle. They stood out like a sore thumb. I began to wonder if this entire experience was all in my head like a David Lynch film. There was a host, more like a Maitre d, who managed to make eye contact with me. I had forgotten about the vibrator in my had, which would signal that my order was up. He assured me everything would be fine. The wait would not be much longer, and my food would be everything I needed it to be. I'm glad I ordered my food to go. As soon as i got my burger, I ran. More like a brisk walk. I knew that burger needed a minute to cool down to a temperature that would allow me to swallow without burning my throat. I was breathing heavy, and for the first time, I exhaled as I charged through the doors of my work and into the break room. For a moment, I was alone, and I undressed, I mean unwrapped, that burger slowly.  Then I showed that burger who's boss, sinking my teeth in like Lorena Bobbitt. Alas, I was in love, and she was beautiful. Pink on the inside. Moist. Medium, just like the man at the register told me it would be. My entire daydream faded as quickly as the onset. ""WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?"" It felt so confrontational. I was guilty. I stumbled over my words. It didn't take long to pull my coworker into my world. She didn't need to touch or taste in order to tell I was having a love affair with a burger. She only needed her sense of smell and the visual of the melting cheese and immediately knew what was going on. Finally, she left me alone so I could finish.",0.9937,0.786,0.14,0.075,0.5574772192827748

What if you don't want to schlep yourself and your homies all the way to the West Loop? Our answers have been answered by offering delicious burgas in Wicker Park.  Amen! Small Cheval's menu is much more simple than his older brother. I walk up and see a line but its moving because the guys on the line are cranking these burgers out in record time. I ordered a burger, no cheese with all the fixins with the bacon, fries and a shake (don't judge me). The place is small with extended outdoor seating. Everything here is super simple pop-up-esque dining.  I love it. You order. You pay. You find a seat and eat. First you need to recognize the amazing condiments line. Shout out to the garlic aioli! I have already decided to dip my fries and slather that on my burger. Our order arrived and the first thing I do is bask in this mighty burger's glory. Perfectly cooked and not overcooked which a lot of burgers can be. Mr. Sodikoff aint goin' out like that. The dijonaise on the burger adds a different level of flavor and adding to the juicy flavor. The bacon really makes the burger in my honest opinion. This burger is not the exact same as its older bro, Au Cheval and thats OK with me. Small Cheval has its own burger identity and I am a fan. The fries where golden brown and(dipped in garlic aioli) made that whole trip worth it and my chocolate shake (ps. You can make it a boozy shake if you want) was the cherry on top of an awesome dinner.  Prices are reasonable for a quality gourmet burger.

2015-11-16,5.0,"After debating for hours about whether to go to Au Cheval or Small Cheval (here after referred to as Regular and Small, respectively, as per our nickname for the places), my friend and I took the plunge and decided to try Small this past Friday. She was insistent on walking and avoiding public transportation (an abnormal New Yorker) and Small was only a 20 minute walk, whereas Regular was an hour and 20. Small won by a landslide (considering the 35 degree weather). The menu was horribly extensive (just kidding) - a whole 3 items to choose from. But really, those three (or for my needs, two) items on the menu are all you need - fill your stomach with an out of this world cheeseburger and an order of their delicious golden fries and you'll be thinking about this meal for days, as I've been doing. Another one of the best parts is the 5-part condiment line, including 2 different kind of ketchups, mustard, mayonnaise, and garlic aioli. Yes, that's right folks, UNLIMITED GARLIC AIOLI.  My friend and I rated the cheeseburger an 8 - it was double-pattied juiciness, with a great dijonaise, pickles, and lettuce. It was probably the best burger I've had in a longggg time and definitely more than I expected from Regular's smaller sibling. To be honest, I would say that in some instances, this burger may actually be better than Regular's. Yup, that's right, I said it. Avoid the long lines and wait times at Regular and go to Small for a hella good burger.  And even though we were so full and ate so much we felt like vomming, we took the plunge and got a milkshake as well. Chocolate? Vanilla? Hm, vanilla. No, chocolate. Most people have chocolate. But I usually like vanilla. The debates continued so my friend went ahead and asked someone who worked there what he would do, and he recommended chocolate, so we went for it. When it came out, he also brought us a complimentary vanilla milkshake, which was so nice of him. That milkshake was so good. Chocolate won. Small wins.",0.9961,0.787,0.187,0.026,0.43205885024066853

The burger was good. It reminded me of burgers from back home. The fries were...well, fries. Nothing to even mention. The aioli was really boring.  The service was really good for being self-service. Everyone was kind and helpful.  Do yourself a favor and just go to Parts and Labor.

At a bare minimum, at least I didn't have to wait as long to be disappointed. When they say, ""no substitutes"", what they mean is... We mostly pre fab your burger like on a conveyer. Henry Ford said it well.... You can have any color Ford you want.... As long as its black.  The people were really nice. But, it seemed to be a huge ordeal, and just not possible to avoid putting mayo on my burger. Hey mayo... F$&# you! That s#!+ is disgusting, and I have an allergic reaction to that horrible stuff.... Ok. Maybe it's partly in my head. Like most people's gluten allergies. Hahaha. But, I wasn't asking for a substitute. Only that you skip a step. I get that you have a small kitchen, and can't have all the things that one can order on their burger at the main location. But, they then proceeded to tell me that I could order two kids cheeseburgers, and reassemble them to make a single adult burger.... Oh, but it would cost me twice as much. Seemed a bit petty and insulting. That only said, ""We can do what you're asking. But, we're too stuck up to actually do it.""  I felt pretty embarrassed in front of my friends that, over the last three years, I've convinced they were going to eat the best burger of their lives. I had to order the mediocre fries, and pretend to be happy with them. But, the ketchup was fantastic. If you like mayo, it's probably not a bad experience. If you want more say in what goes onto your plate, check out Revolution. They have a great burger, that you can get without mayo.... I mean, seriously....

There is no table service though, you get a buzzer and come pick up your food. That's perfectly fine, just manage your expectations.

Let me start by saying the milkshake was 5 stars- perfect- As I was getting some ketchup and the garlic aioli(which is a nice add on), I was looking for some salt- none to be found- turns out they have one salt shaker for the whole place- the guy behind the counter explained they didn't think their food need any more seasoning than what they cook with- so I  skipped the salt on the burger- I suppose it didn't need any extra salt- The Cheeseburger- was a little under cooked for a thin burger (two of them) ..There was a thin piece of tasteless bacon- certainly not worth 2 bucks- couldn't even taste it.. So you have a ten dollar burger a four dollar milk shake- I skipped the fries in favor of my waistline.  I really think you get a better burger and shake at Culver's for half the price of Small Cheval.  Culver's is everywhere- Small Cheval is in Wicker Park- so if you're there- you are there.

If you have been to au cheval expect a slightly different experience.  Still very high quality burger with a killer bun and great homemade sauce. Unfortunately no egg option here like at the namesake and the bacon isn't the amazing thick cut stuff-  it is rather ordinary thin stuff.  However if you are looking for a great burger this place does the trick. Just don't expect best in the country burger. Go to the original for that. Think of small cheval as a vastly improved shake shack.

2015-09-15,4.0,"Okay, I may be the only person here but I preferred the burger here at Small Cheval over Au Cheval. I don't know if it's the fact that I didn't have to wait 3 hours for a burger or the fact that I got to sit outside in a very relaxed environment, but it just tasted much much better over here. We got here on a Friday afternoon around 1pm and it was pretty busy as the patio was full so I was thinking I would have to wait quite a while but to my surprise I only waited inside like 10 minutes. Then when I asked the guy how long until my pager would be called, he said it would another 10 minutes which I thought is a pretty fair deal. However, my pager went off in like 2 minutes time no joke! Seriously score. I got to have this amazing burger in my hands within 15 minutes of arrival. I think that made it taste that much better. I liked the patio more than the inside maybe due to all those colored chairs and there were a few umbrellas where you can hide from the sun but this would totally be a great place in the evening if you want some comfort food or absolutely amazing burgers anytime of the year actually. Although I probably wouldn't sit outside in the winter and would grab myself a burger to go since I can imagine the inside getting tight very fast. The actual burger was delicious, I wouldn't say cheap since it's the same price as Au Cheval and fries are extra. I would make it a few dollars cheaper since it's not the same exact experience. The fries are so worth getting, super crispy and they have all their sauces you can get on the side including that much talked about garlic aoli (yep, get that). The burger itself super moist but not over done where the bread gets soggy, it's seriously the perfect all american burger and one of my faves in Chicago.

2015-09-03,4.0,"In terms of food, Small Cheval is not QUITE it's big brother, but it is pretty darn close. Forget fancy toppings like truffle aioli, pickled okra, or balsamic emulsion. Small Cheval is what you want a good ol' American Cheeseburger to taste like, and in that, it is a success.  The pickles, onions, dijonaisse, cheese and bacon all work well in harmony to create the classic cheeseburger flavor. The bun is sturdy enough to hold on to all of this but doesn't take over by any means. The patties are juicy and flavorful. Yes, the bacon is thinner than Au Cheval's and no, you can't get a fried egg, but so what -- this was still a mighty fine burger. As for why this place does not get 5 stars, there definitely are some things it needs to work on: - The service is SLOW. You will not have to wait as long as you would for Au Cheval by any means, but there was still a line out the door (which I expected). However, what annoyed me was how slowly the line moved once you were inside. It's like the people ahead of me have never ordered a cheeseburger before. Which leads me to my next point... -During busy times, keep the burgers cooking. It took a little too long for us to get our food (about 25 minutes from ordering) Listen, I understand the whole, ""Cooked-to-order"" concept. However, when there is a line out the door and all you serve is burgers, it's not that difficult to realize that you're going to need a lot of burgers. As long as it's hot and fresh, I honestly don't mind if I get by burger only a couple minutes after I ordered it. -It's more expensive than it should be. It's not McDonald's, so I know I'm not going to pay McDonald's prices. But I shouldn't pay ""sit-down restaurant"" prices either. $10 (plus an extra $2 for bacon) for a counter-serve cheeseburger is a little too much. But obviously, it's not deterring people from lining up to get one yet, so who am I to judge? You would think that with all of the above negatives, my rating would be three stars, at most.

Like Sodikoff's burgers elsewhere (Bavette's and Dillman's), this burger has small differences and is certainly very good in its own right, but it's just not quite the same. And I believe that is by design. He doesn't want the Au Cheval to become Shake Shack or M Burger.  In all, this is a different experience than Au Cheval that's worth having (loved the shake), but I don't think you can walk away from it proclaiming that you've ""tried the burger at Au Cheval.""",0.9742,0.82,0.16,0.021,0.5492698412698414
2015-08-17,5.0,"I am a pretty big fan of this place! It's simple and delicious. There are only three things on the menu: Cheeseburger, Hamburger and Fries. However, they do have a lot of condiments, including the best garlic aioli! This burger is definitely one of the best burgers I've had in Chicago. Of course, it's not a crazy flavor combination (i.e. duck fat crispy onion rings with arugula, pomegranate, orange slices and almond shavings topped with truffle oil) - it's just a regular burger with their special sauce, cheese and pickles - but still, it's REALLY GOOD! The burger is perfectly cooked and super juicy. There is usually plenty of seating and the line moves fast, so don't be discouraged if the line is around the block. I think having essentially 1 thing on the menu makes it really easy to serve. The only downside is that if you want a drink, you will have to stand in this line (so stick with buying pitchers instead of glasses!). Also, there is an L line right here, so it can get pretty noisy. But all in all, great spot for a burger and a beer!

2015-08-15,4.0,"If you come here expecting an exact replica of an Au Cheval burger, you might leave disappointed. But if you can appreciate a solid burger and fries with a shot of whiskey on the side, then come on down. After reading about Small Cheval taking over Roxie's old spot, I definitely wanted to see how it stacked up with the real deal. It seemed like a good enough idea, giving burger lovers a chance to get a piece of the Au Cheval menu without having to endure that absurd wait.  We got there around 7 on a Friday night and there was a line out the door. It looked intimidating at first, but the wait wasn't actually too terrible. We were inside within 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes in the line inside before we ordered. We probably waited a half hour between when we got there and when our food was ready.  Ambiance: The inside is pretty much identical to Roxie's. It was small and had a real casual atmosphere. It's the same drill too: order at the counter and just wait for your order to be called. There were a couple tables inside and a pretty large patio outside with plenty of seating, which is a huge plus over the cramped inside of Au Cheval. You could actually come with a group larger than 4 for once.  Food: The menu is pretty simple. Hamburger or cheeseburger with the option to add bacon, then the only side is fries. Like Au Cheval the burgers automatically come with two patties. It's impossible to not compare the burger to Au Cheval's, so I'd have to describe Small's burger as a slightly toned down, faster food version of Au Cheval's. I thought the actual burger patties were pretty much the same. Just as juicy, and just as delicious. The bun was also really similar, with a really nice toasted outer layer but still a soft pillowy center.  The major differences come with the add-ons. The most obvious is the bacon. The bacon on Small Cheval's burger is definitely thinner and just slightly better than what you would find on any other fast food burger. It was still tasty and flavorful (I mean how could bacon NOT taste great??) but it was just missing that awesome sweet and peppery glaze on the outside and that thickness that made it a major component of the burger rather than just a topping. The second major difference is there's no option to add an egg. I'd throw eggs on everything if I could, so this was kind of disappointing. I wanted that golden stream of egg yolk running down the sides to make every bite that much heartier.  The fries that came with the burger were great. They were definitely thinner, but they were super crispy and salted well. I'd say the biggest upgrade at Small Cheval over Au Cheval is the self-serve sauce station. Giving me the freedom to take as much garlic ailoi I want is a very dangerous thing. I ate disgusting amounts of aioli that night. The garlic flavor was very potent and overall it was just amazingly rich and creamy. I slathered it all over the buns, I dumped some between the meat patties, and of course every bite of a fry was naked without a trip to the aioli cup.  Overall, I enjoyed the burger at Small Cheval. It doesn't match the greatness of the almighty Au Cheval burger, but it's pretty tasty in its own right. A cheeseburger with bacon and fries would run you about $15, which is a little on the steep end, but still only a little more than something like Five Guys, and it tastes much better. It's not a bad option to get a quick bite. Now if they only added the bologna sandwich to the menu, then I'd be here everyday.",0.9984,0.788,0.173,0.039,0.5222890786749482

Knowing the lines have been long, my neighbor next to my house and I arrived at 4pm excited to relax and wait! Being pregnant we pulled 2 chairs from patio to start line by door. Staff cleaning the windows were super nice (initially) and opened door and said he liked our idea and we looked cozy! He reiterated they open at 5 sharp. All good! We shared we had been sharing the news with people walking by and even had talked a woman into standing in line with us. This nice staff man even checked on us again prior prior to 5 and at this time told those standing around they open at 5.  Our experience soon and unfortunately abruptly changed at 4:52. A woman came out and said we can't block the doorway. Huh? We were confused. We said, we r happy to put chairs back, we were waiting since 4 and I'm pregnant. She said you can keep the chairs but put them to the side so people can go in? Huh? She said we have been open for drinks and people can go in. This was news to us! She went on to say the patio is open for drinks and we can order them and then go in through the ""back door"" to get in line. Huh? This seemed weird. Her attitude was horrible and nothing she was saying to now the 3 of us was making sense. It seemed she just didn't want us standing in front and didn't explain we could start line in side.We found her very condescending. But, not wanting lose our place in line, and excited to try the burger, we followed her advise, after all, she explained she's the manager and only one with keys and runs the show, despite sharing with her the nice man that came out 3x with no issue.. She had us wait in the back by the back door. She said she will tell us a few minutes before they open so we can rush in and get in front of register, cuz there is a rush from the other door too. What? This sounded so unorganized and now choosing who has  special access or knows the secret? This was weird. It was 5 and she never came back to us. We simply walked in and stood in front of register, and we saw others come in from other door. Horrible!  $39 for 2 cheeseburgers, 2 fries, 2 shakes. I did get the bacon despite hearing bad reviews. I commented at register about reluctance with bacon and guys response was ""the bacon is just thinner"". I think that's where everyone is getting this phrase. Fact is, it's not the truth, the bacon does taste differ for whatever reason, if it's thinner it taste differ then Au Cheval and that's the point and I have had great experiences there, even posted on yelp. Regardless, burger was great. Fries disappointing. Prices super high for overall experience.  Bottom line: restaurant has a major issue when the staff is more talented than the main manager! I am confident Bucktown will not settle for this ignorant inexperienced attitude. I'm disappointed and frankly surprised this is who the successful restaurant group is trusting to start up Small. The attitude from main manager running this shop makes me never want to visit again, and I know my neighbor and random woman we met in mine was effected the same. Another random staff member helping at register was nice enough to give me owners email to follow up. Frankly, I feel uncomfortable based on how we were treated.I will stick to Au Cheval minus the drama and feeling unwanted with miscommunication of how to simply even get in this place at 5 sharp!

Fries were really good. Portion is a nice size and if you are hungry you can order one per person otherwise you could share. Beer selection on tap is pretty good and average $6-7 beer. Overall I really enjoyed the food and ambiance. I am not sure how often I would go as the line was so long to order but there is a line for good reason. I recommend you go. I'm happy I did. Good neighborhood spot.",0.9958,0.747,0.224,0.029,0.5109187109187109
2015-07-31,4.0,"Didn't even realize it was the opening day! Boom.  Well if you haven't been to the actual Au Cheval, you gotta go there. This is not that really. Smaller burger. Small place. Counter service. Quick sure, good sure, just not the same. Nice there isn't a wait consisting of 73619 hours though! But that might change? Who knows.  Expensive for what it is surely. $16 for burger with bacon and fries. And I tipped $2. Because you should people. They messed up the order number with me and my friend. Not a big deal and first day. And one of the dudes here offered the burger on the house. Wasn't necessary. But nice. The star off is simply for price. But we are in Chicago and Wicker Park/Bucktown so somewhat expected.  And to the dude who wrote the first review about not having vegetarian options: YOU ARE A CLOWN. Please get off Yelp. Okay thanks.",0.9395,0.813,0.145,0.042,0.5407738095238095
2015-07-31,3.0,"Au Cheval's younger hipster sibling has opened appropriately in Bucktown/Wicker Park. We came a little before 6pm on Friday and there were a handful of people ahead of us in line. The layout and ordering is the same as Roxie's - order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. Took about 10 minutes for us to get our order, total we were in and out in a little over 30 minutes - beats waiting two hours at Au Cheval. The cheeseburger is mostly the same here (and a dollar cheaper?!) -- similar if not same bun, similar if not same Sysco patties (a ""double"" is still 3 patties), same Kraft cheese, same pickles, same aioli, and same chopped onions. The bigger differences are in the additions: 1) you can order tomato and lettuce 2) no fried eggs here and 3) probably the most glaring difference is that the bacon is different. I know those who swear it's the bacon that makes the burger at Au Cheval. That peppery, maple glazed thick piece of pork belly. The bacon at Small Cheval is smaller, thinner, less maple-y, and not peppery at all. It's pretty much thicker cut bacon that you'd get on a typical burger with bacon. Sadsies. The fries are supposed to be the same as well, but they were kind sogsville when I got them. They still tasted great, just not as crispy as I remember. Hopefully it's just those first-day jitters and it'll get better. Another difference is they have milkshakes - chocolate and vanilla. I ordered chocolate but they gave me vanilla and I was too lazy to get back into the ever-growing line. The vanilla shake is made with real vanilla beans as shown by the black flecks swimming through my shake. While great in flavor, the shake itself turned soupy really quickly -- not the texture I'm looking for in a shake. Shakes need to be in that limbo between frozen popsicle and melted ice cream. Again, hoping this will get better. Milkshakes are new-ish territory for Sodikoff around here, no? The bonus on Fridays and Saturdays is that the Doughnut Vault truck parks itself outside. As if you haven't consumed enough calories, the truck tempts you with the thought of doughnuts on your way out. Also, outdoor patio has lots of seating. The Adirondack chairs are not ideal for consuming burgers, but rather for the after-effects of needing to lay back and enjoying your beer, or undoing that top button of your pants. All-in-all, I'm still ecstatic that I can walk down the street and get some version of the Au Cheval burger. I heard this might just be a temporary summer thing and Roxie's is supposed to be back in the winter. Sorry Roxie's, I think I'd prefer Small Cheval to stay forever. EDIT: Small Cheval is here to stay, yay!",0.9915,0.844,0.111,0.046,0.4076252723311546
2015-07-31,4.0,"Not bad. Food was good, but not great like the main location. Prices are a little high for a small burger shop- $10, but they're fancy looking, so I get it. Fries were 3 bucks. They called my number for the wrong order, so I had to switch. Luckily, it was with another member of my party, so it was no big deal (they did offer to remake it, which was nice, but not needed). Maybe just working out the opening day kinks, but the original still takes the cake.",0.0896,0.68,0.166,0.154,0.6144444444444445
2015-07-31,2.0,"The double patty burger comes with diced onions, a few pickles, and a messy amount of garlic aioli. It does not come with lettuce or tomato. The fries were small and better at your local fast food joint. The vanilla milkshake was delicious.  The burger was ordered with lettuce and tomato but when I got home there wasn't any. Failed. Expensive and not worth it.",0.6254,0.831,0.114,0.055,0.3727272727272727
2015-07-31,5.0,"Overall our first experience at Small Cheval was pretty darn great. No wait and the food was still delicious(it seems more of a fast food place). The staff was pretty awesome too. We first tried to get a seat at Au Cheval at around 4:30 (kitchen was still closed up to 5:00pm) and we were told that the wait was going to be around an hour to an hour and forty five minutes. So we gave this place a shot and seating was plentiful. No wait, great food, awesome atmosphere. Two thumbs up! Side note: A couple things to note is the menu is MUCH MUCH smaller. Also the bacon is nowhere near as good/thick as at the original place.",0.9719,0.782,0.186,0.032,0.5885416666666666
2015-07-30,5.0,Best burgers. EVER.  WHO HAS TIME TO WAIT FOR A TABLE AT AU CHEVAL?? Get there. Get nice counter service. Sit down at one of the communal tables or 4 tops and eat.  Or get it to go.  And then be on your way.  Burgers are $9.  You can add bacon for a few bucks and get that sucker with cheese for another dollar.  But what you really shouldn't miss is the condiment station.  Their house-made ketchup is boss and that garlic aoili - OH MY GOD.  I would bathe in it. And boy oh boy are those burgers amazing.  Same Au Cheval burger we all know and crave minus the whole waiting for hours for a table.,0.9394,0.824,0.149,0.027,0.4213888888888889
