2016-01-01,5.0,"I ADORE this place.  Was working at American Theatre Company and lost track of how many dinners I had here while working there because it was just the best food in the area as well as some of the best thai.  They have a great dinner deal during the week M-Th with a starter, soup or salad, and entree for $10.99 (if I remember the price correctly).  And I loved everything I ever ate here.  The Green Egg Rolls were always piping hot, fresh, crispy, and the best egg rolls I've ever eaten.  When I ordered the green salad with ginger dressing, I expected the standard creamy ginger dressing you get everywhere.  Instead, this was like a ginger vinaigrette with a little bit of spicy kick to it which I loved.  And the entrees:  the Thai Fried Rice was chock full of onion, fresh, and delicious.  Then you can get Crab Fried rice with lots of shredded crab mixed in.  And finally:  Sweet and Sour Soft Shell Crab.  Let me just repeat that:  Sweet and Sour Soft Shell Crab.  When have I ever seen that on another menu??  Never.  And Fantastic!!  Not the gloppy sweet and sour sauce you get almost everywhere but a light, fresh sauce, the crab cooked perfectly.  I can still taste it weeks after I've had it.  Perfect Thai Iced Tea.  Service so friendly.  Oh, and I should mention I went with one of the other actors there one night and she got the Tom Yum Soup and raved about it, wanting to get the recipe because it was so good.  This place is worth traveling too because it is, in my opinion, the best Thai restaurant in the city.",0.9961,0.778,0.216,0.005,0.48175675675675683

Nice semi-casual atmosphere with painted exposed brick, a nice number of booths and tables, and quick service.  My fiancé and I both got the dinner special, which is an amazing deal. $10 for a personal appetizer (about 5 options), soup or salad of the day, and a protein/veggie based entree of your choice from a list of like 10 options. Everything tasted excellent - I was honestly very impressed. Ginger Rice soup was a clean and satisfying start, with 2 perfect little crab rangoons as my appetizer - the filling was on point and came with a tangy dipping sauce. My fiancé got the veggie spring rolls, which he said were great as well. I got the chicken panang curry and I felt like I was in heaven. Great portion size, creamy with just the right amount of heat and generous thinly sliced strips of chicken with jasmine rice and veggies. It was unbelievably good.

I'm grateful that five people were able to walk in and sit down at 7:45pm, but I do wonder why all of you in Yelp land are avoiding this wonderful establishment. Namo has excellent food at reasonable prices; unobtrusive and efficient service; a beautiful atmosphere; and is BYOB with no corkage fee. What gives, folks? Our group ordered a wide variety of items from the menu -- lobster dishes, beef dishes, vegan dishes -- and we loved everything. We brought 3 bottles of wine, and had barely put them on the table when the server appeared with a corkscrew, and she opened them for us. One bottle was white wine, and the server got an ice bucket for it, so the white wine could chill. Again, at no cost to us. Vegans and vegetarians should especially like this restaurant. Most Thai restaurants can accommodate special diets, but Namo devotes the last page of its menu to strictly vegan offerings. And vegans get more than one choice in the different categories, which is a rare and wonderful thing.  Friends, you need to get out and have your next restaurant meal at Namo Thai Cuisine.

2015-07-24,5.0,"For vegans, Thai food can be annoying with the pervasiveness of nam pla (), or fish sauce.  Otherwise Thai is very veg friendly with the pick-a-protein swapability of almost everything.  So I was a little worried that the vegan dishes here would be bland or secretly have nam pla.  Glad to say neither is the case. The other big relief is when the pad thai comes with no egg, just like you asked.  Personally the pad thai here is not my top, but still decent.   My real test is ordering something boring sounding, in this case ""cashew,"" eating all the veg and tofu, and then mixing the sauce in with the rice.  If that is delicious (and how it was) then the place is a keeper.   The lunch specials were an excellent deal too.  It is especially nice when the associated appetizer comes out in a cute plate with a salad and soup.  I regret not trying the sticky rice, but we got too much food on our trip.  We'll have to return, clearly. Staff was super friendly and accommodating to small kids.  The do indeed have high chairs, but I forget if they have changing tables. The decor is very nice and the atmosphere relaxing, though vegans will need to ignore the fish traps hung around.

2015-06-05,1.0,"I'm hugely disappointed. I order from here quite often and last night I wanted to stay away from carb-heavy food. I went with the chicken satay, calamari salad, and edamame.  I had it delivered since I live super close and I was unable to pick it up, it's always hot and fresh. Last night, the calamari was barely cooked.  First, the lime dressing has an overly acidic flavor that taste more like a battle with acid reflux than something you'd want to eat. Second, the calamari was barely cooked and tasted like it was from Lake Michigan, it wasn't even close to edible. Third, the salad consisted of so much lettuce even if the calamari was grilled, it'd drown in a sea of leafy greens. I took two bites and tossed the remainder of the mess. The chicken satay was mediocre. Whatever you do, don't try the peanut ""sauce."" It resembled a gritty whole foods peanut butter and tasted off. I would have been better off dipping the satay in my crunchy Jiff. Needless to say, I ate the chicken skewers but kept them as plain as possible.  Lastly, the edamame. These poor soy beans looked like they had been sun bathing, they were dry and some were crusty-brown on the ends. They were lukewarm, at best.  I ordered three things and ended up eating the chicken, the rest was garbage and a waste of money.

Not only am I vegan, but I am also VERY allergic to fish. I ordered the pad kee mao and noted no fish, though it was marked vegan anyway. When the food came, I took a single bite of the pad kee mao and immediately began having an allergic reaction. Fish sauce! I couldn't believe it. I rushed to take my medicine, inhaler, and threw up. Still, my lips started to swell and my throat hurt by the time I got it under control. As for Namo, they denied there was fish sauce. Let me tell you-- there was fish sauce. They offered a few dollars off the order, but they still charged for the food that I had to throw out. No apology. They just denied it had happened. Let me say again-- it happened.

The menu had all the typical items like Pad Thai, Pad se ew, spring rolls and Thai fried rice.  A few things were new riffs on Thai food that I hadn't see before - things like Fruit fried rice, lobster pad thai, lime chicken fried rice which sadly I didn't notice until after I had ordered.   My friend and I ordered fresh spring rolls to start out our meal.   They are typically a nice cool refreshing way to start a thai meal before you experience the spicy heat that Thai food is know for.  Namo's spring rolls however where a total disappointment and we only ate a couple bites.   I noticed when we ordered them that the description said  tofu, bean sprout, cucumber and plum sauce.  I typically have seen shrimp or chicken in fresh spring rolls  instead of tofu,  but I like tofu so was willing to try a new twist.  Sadly the dish was exactly as they described without any other flavorful ingredients like fresh basil, cilantro or ginger to give it depth of flavor. .  They don't put much filling inside the roll which had a small  piece of bland tofu, a couple sprouts and a small piece of cucumber that I could barely taste.    There wasn't even a piece of carrot for color and more crunch.  The rice paper was also different than I've experienced in the past - usually it's fairly transparent and reveals the colors of the items wrapped inside.  This was opaque, thick and white - maybe they just didn't soak it long enough before wrapping them.  The rolls were cut in bite size pieces and lined on the plate a bit like sushi.  Because they were  loosely wrapped  the slippery tofu fell out.       The entrees continued on a similar vein - the dishes resembled what we expected but the execution was poor.  My friend ordered a chicken cashew dish which she said was ok but not a wow.  I ordered the Pad Se Ew that has the large flat noodles which can be a polarizing dish - either you love the texture and taste of these wide, thick and substantial noodles or it's just not something you like to bite into.  I really like Pad Se Ew and will often order it.      The noodles were a bit thin and looked like they were very drenched in soy sauce since they had become a dark grey brown color that was n't visually appetizing.  What little Chinese broccoli that was in the dish wasn't cooked well and was almost completely raw which gives it a bitter taste and tougher texture.  Being summer I wasn't in the mood for hot tea and cold tea didn't sound good at the time.   So I asked what else they had and the waitress encourage me to order the Ginger Cherry.  I really like ginger especially strong fresh ginger ales so thought I'd give it a whirl.  Sadly it  also wasn't as great as it sounds and tasted like a sticky sweet grenadine punch that was a sad kiddie cocktail.  They don't serve alcohol so you need to BYOB. Bottom line:  I think Namo is below average but maybe would have been more impressed if I tried some of the less familiar items on the menu like the lime chicken fried rice.  Would commit to trying them next time but not sure there will be a next time - mainly chose this place because it's across from Martyr's that had an event that night and there was nothing so compelling I'd drive 30 min to get there.",0.9904,0.803,0.131,0.066,0.5373228511782729

2013-07-23,4.0,Namo has become one of my go to delivery Thai place in the area.   I have been on the endless search for the perfect bowl of red curry and Namo comes close. Most of the time the red curry is to sweet or just spicy with no flavoring. Namo finds a pretty good balance on both fronts.   My husband usually goes for the pad thai which is pretty on par with others in the area. They offer coupons when you order online (score!) and are reasonably priced with other Thai places.  I would reccomend them if you are in the area.,0.9336,0.833,0.147,0.02,0.5604166666666667

2013-07-16,3.0,"Hello Chicago. I was visiting the area for a convention and was looking for a great Thai restaurant to take some clients to.  I didn't want to stay in the downtown area so we ventured to Namo based on Yelp reviews. The word Meh comes to mind when thinking about how to sum up my experience.  To start, I do like the neighborhood and was excited when we pulled up.  Kind of a nice, open decor.  Nothing fancy but it suited the area.  Upon being seated we were given the regular menu and we had to ask for their special ""vegan / vegetarian"" menu which is no big deal but should be offered upon sitting. We started out with the Fresh Spring Rolls.  Completely flavorless.  Cut up like sushi rolls, with just plain tofu, and absolutely no flavor.  They were served with a plum sauce which didn't do much.  I had to ask for the chili paste in order to jazz them up.  We also had the chive cakes, which were pretty tasty.  Lightly fried with a nice flavor. I had the lobster Pad Thai.  Again, meh.  Basic Pad Thai rice noodles with an ok sauce.  They had the scrapped out lobster tail on the top of the noodles for decoration but the amount of lobster on the dish was pretty small.  The entree was pretty basic and I can say I have had much better Pad Thai out there.  My Sweetie who accompanied me thought her wok dish was pretty bland and lacking originality and flavor. Namo is ok, and would be ok if I lived around there and didn't feel like driving a bit to find somewhere better.",0.9949,0.757,0.204,0.039,0.5927182013388911

I've had the fish cakes, pot stickers, duck noodle soup, and tofu pad siew.  All is more fresh and less greasy than your average Thai.  Fish cakes are great, and served with this rockin' tangy dipping sauce.  Pot stickers were a little more on the ""average"" side, but they came free with a large order.  Duck noodle soup had great broth and really tender pieces of duck.  Tofu pad siew had great flavor, crunchy Chinese broccoli, and soft yummy tofu. I think it's really affordable, take-out is ready quickly, and everything tastes freshly prepared.  Not very high on the ""authenticity"" scale (unless they have a secret menu I don't know about?)  Nothing on the menu is unusual, it's all the usual Thai offerings.  I take that back - they do have a few unique seafood dishes.  But generally it's all the stuff you've heard of, made well and served hot. Oh but speaking of hot, don't be afraid to order ""hot.""  It's not really that hot. I mean it is spicy, you'll feel it, but it's edible.  I've been to places where ""hot"" was equivalent to like, death.  It's much more tolerable here.",0.9875,0.813,0.166,0.021,0.5533171097195488

A feast for both the eyes and tastebuds, this creation has been on my mind ever since. It comes out as a plate of noodles with your mix ins surrounding it. On top sits a lobster tail shell and it's all covered by this gorgeous egg web. I confess I didn't know how I was supposed to eat it. I don't ever get lobster and was nervous about having to dig it out of its shell. But there was no need to fear. Once you break through the egg web, you pick up the shell and find beautifully seared pieces of lobster tucked underneath to be mixed in with everything else. I also tried the postickers as my starter and they were very crispy and came with a zingy dipping sauce.  The restaurant itself is clean and modern and the service is friendly and polite.

We found Namo as a highly rated thai restaurant via  opentable.com . It was a bit of a trek for us from River North via car, but parking is plentiful in the area. Here's what we ordered: Appetizer - Fresh Spring Rolls - These were awesome and gone in like 2 seconds. Much healthier than fried rolls, they actually came displayed like sushi rolls. Perhaps the highlight of the meal!  First Course - Cucumber Salad & Cucumber Tofu Soup - Both were actually quite good. Liked the light dressing on the salad but thought that the soup was a bit heavy on the cilantro.  Main Course - Chicken Green Curry - Perhaps the best curry I've had, and I've had alot of curry. Somehow they managed to hit the perfect level of spice - enough to provide some slight heat, not enough to make me sweat. The sticky rice that came with it was awesome too.  I'd also recommend the Acai, Cranberry and Sprite drink - perfect match for the thai spice.  My only complaint is that I literally ate too much, which I suppose is my fault, not Namo's :)  Highly, highly recommended!",0.9955,0.715,0.249,0.037,0.5488172043010751

2012-07-11,5.0,"I came here with a friend on mine and we expected decent thai food. However, this place blew us away. First off, it's BYOB. That's a great plus. The decor is nice. It's definitely appropriate for a casual dinner or date. The prix fix menu is $20 and included starter, appetizer, entree, and dessert. The starter and appetizers were INSANELY delicious. They were a good size but not too much. The entree (lobster pad thai) was easily one of the best pad thais I've ever tasted. They use real lobster tail meat and include the tail so you know it's fresh and not artificial. The chunks of meat were plentiful. Dessert was good too and not too rich. All that for $20! For the price, this place blew me away. I would easily pay $30 if not more for the same meal. The decor is nice, the hostesses and staff were nice, and food is unbelievable.",0.9875,0.734,0.236,0.03,0.6547101449275362
2012-07-06,4.0,"Namo. I'm a fan. My partner and I (yes) came here out of randomness since we drive pass every day. From the moment you walk in your welcomed, greeted, and the heavenly house music distracts you from the decor that could use a little help. Anyways the food was delicious and this is coming form someone who grew up eating thai food. I had the duck pineapple and my expectations were blow away. I was expecting sliced duck on a bed of lettuce bathing in pineapple marinated sliced bell peppers (if that did not sounds good already) but NOPE! The chef kept half the charred sliced pineapple with the bell peppers sitting in the juices. The presentation and the food was amazing! Worth checking out!",0.9385,0.824,0.15,0.025,0.5444444444444444

2012-06-24,4.0,"We had an excellent dinner at Namo last night. We were going to see a show at the American Theater Company right across the street, so we decided to use a $25  restaurant.com  certificate there and check out the place. I ordered the ginger scallops, and my fiance ordered the pad kee mao noodles. The noodles were pretty typical fare, but the ginger scallops were very good. They were large, very tender, and although the scallops were slightly cold the ginger broth and vegetables gave them a nice, light taste. We had the spring rolls and chicken dumplings for appetizers, both also pretty typical. Our bill was only around $45, and with the certificate we only ended up paying about $25 including 18% gratuity. Our server was excellent. I'd eat here again the next time we come to a show!",0.9707,0.845,0.146,0.01,0.6716290726817042

2012-05-18,4.0,"came here last night with a friend and we ordered the lobster paid thai and the lamb tamarind.  Flavors were fresh, authentic, yet with a bit of unique and modern flare that you don't get in most thai restaurants.  The lamb tamarind was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the pad thai was probably the best I've ever had.  They served a little set of spices and salt with the pad thai, and it is DELICIOUS with a bit of the red pepper and lime sprinkled on top.  SERIOUSLY good. I took off a star because the taro ice cream was just meh for me.  I'd have preferred a deeper, stronger taro flavor, and the coconut jelly was strangely hard and off putting. totally ordering take out from here tonight.",0.9652,0.769,0.179,0.051,0.5348958333333333
2012-05-12,5.0,"MY FAVORITE THAI PLACE! The food was even better than most I had in Thailand! I guess it's still more on the American Thai side, but gosh it was so delicious! We ordered Seabag as appetizer which was super yummy. We wanted both entrees extra spicy, and they turned out to be just as spicy as we wanted but still had all the flavors that the original dish should have. The service was excellent so I ended up giving her 30% tip for lunch. Cannot wait to go back there!",0.9887,0.702,0.298,0.0,0.546969696969697

The angry tiger was a steak with sticky rice dish, the sauce was perfect for the steak and sticky rice, it balanced eachother out. I would highly recommend trying this place out if you haven't, the price is very reasonable for this part of town!",0.6786,0.801,0.12,0.079,0.5067261904761905

2012-03-30,3.0,"Ordered lobster pad thai and basil chicken for take out. The flavors were very good, no complaint there. I like their house specialties menu: it's unique. However the basil chicken had zero heat. It's supposed to be a spicy dish, and I was not asked about heat level when I placed the order. I'd be hesitant to go back and order my favorite thai item (green curry) since it's supposed to be spicy too.",0.412,0.804,0.109,0.087,0.6475

We ordered to share the lobster pad thai, duck pineapple, chicken pad see ew and let our excellent server pick the 4th - ginger scallop. All were fantastic especially the duck pineapple (my fave).  I definitly will be back to try the rest of the signature dishes.  I also recommend the icecream dessert!

2012-03-25,4.0,"Came with a group the other day and ordered family style. We started with the Moo Ping (marinated pork w/ sticky rice) and Pan Danas Chicken (something we don't usually see at other thai restaurants). It reminded me of eating the yummy street food in Thailand for real. The Angry Tiger (a spin on the original Crying Tiger dish) was surprisingly good. The meat had a nice grilled kick to it that again made me feel like it was just grilled up on a side street in Thailand by an older lady, placed into a plastic bag, and I was on my way to catch the train. The side sauce complimented it perfectly and we finished it off with some sticky rice. We also ordered the Papaya Salad which was one of my favorites. When asked how spicy we wanted it, we replied ""Thai spicy"" and it came out with just the right amount of sour heat that I love. We also got the Duck Pineapple - the duck was tender with a balance of sweet n sour pineapples on the side. I especially liked the crispy basil bits! The Lobster Pad Thai was another favorite with a pretty egg nest decoration -- no idea how they made that but it was such like a piece of art that I almost didn't want to eat it...but I did happily. The whole dish was simple yet it was a nice twist on an old favorite. The Mussel Tom-Kha Soup was awesome. I ate it and wondered why no one else has done this before! I spent most of my time scooping up the soup with my mussel shells until my friend saw me and offered me a spoon haha. I also had to order Lad Nar Chicken since that's my go-to for every Thai restaurant and it didn't disappoint either.  For dessert we got the taro coconut ice cream and omg, it was the perfect ending to the meal! I don't usually like taro ice cream but it was so good, not too sweet, and had a nice creamy texture. I'll definitely be back for that alone, no joke. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. The food was yummy and it really showed that they put some extra thought and effort to make traditional dishes their own. The wait staff was super nice and attentive. I loved the mix of modern and traditional pieces in their decorations. It's good for groups or couples with the noise level being just right -- not too loud that you can't hear each other talk but not too quiet that you feel like you have to whisper or else everyone will know your business! Oh, and try the lemon-grass-ade -- refreshing lemonade with a touch of lemongrass that makes it ""thai"". BYOB, too!",0.9986,0.752,0.222,0.026,0.6143494897959184
