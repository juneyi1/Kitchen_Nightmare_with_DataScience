Wasn't a fan of those, but the portion is amazing and it looked like popcorn overflowing in a paperbag!

Unfortunately, my experience was quite mediocre, made even more disappointing by the disproportionately positive reviews. My friend and I tried: Lollipop chicken wings - Dry, stringy meat. I don't think they were salted at all. I wished I was at home so I could cover them with sriracha, the savior of bland foods everywhere. Jja jang myun - The noodles were so overcooked that they had a terrible gummy consistency and gave the dish a watery flavor. Really not awesome. Seafood Jjambong - Another big meh.

I'm really confused by the use of spaghetti noodles in both the jja jang myun and jjambong. How authentic could that possibly be? Wild Chinese mushroom with beef - The mushrooms themselves were really tasty! Perfectly cooked, very flavorful, I wanted to eat them all. Unfortunately the rest of the dish was missing any flavor at all. The meat was chewy and bland, the sauce was nothingness thickened with cornstarch, and the bok choy (one of my favorite vegetables) was just there, doing nothing exciting at all.

Enter my search for that restaurant because I obviously couldn't ask her (until recently as we've became re-acquainted, but that's a whole different story). Once I entered VIP, I definitely remembered having went there with my ex. But this wasn't the jajangmyun place that I was thinking of. Don't get me wrong though: VIP's half jajangmyun, half jjamppong noodles were good too! My stomach was in heaven. But the bowls were way bigger than I remembered them to be, and so this confirmed that it wasn't the place I was thinking of. (But what if I just had a fuzzy memory of that place?? I don't know! OH, THE DILEMMA!!). My friends and I also ordered tangsuyuk and something that my friends called ""lollipop chicken."" I loved the tangsuyuk; I almost think that this is what my ex and I would come here for. It was so good.  As it's unfair to set this place up against a place that may or may not exist, I'm giving it five stars. The owners were nice, and the servers were the same ones I remember from over two years ago.

It was good but wasn't as stellar as I expected from reading other reviews.  The sweet and sour pork was also good; a bit top much batter but was crunchy and and not soggy at all.  The sauce seemed a bit bland at first, until I added the chili oil which made it much better and pushed the tang further.

2010-11-10,4.0,"This is a 4.5 star establishment.  I am Korean. I love Shang Dong style (Korean/Chinese) cuisine. I grew up eating this type of food. VIP is a close competitor of establishments such as Great Sea Restaurant and Great Beijing. The draw is the kampungi (spicy chicken wings).  The spicy chicken wings at VIP were very good. I'm a huge fan of the Great Sea wings, but at times I find them almost too sweet. As a huge fan of sweet and salty combination, I tend to favor that flavor. But after hitting VIP for their wings, I think I prefer those?? It's a toss-up. The wings are still crispy, spicy, and a touch sweet. The balance is great. The wings are juicy. I would walk over my own mother to have one right now. I digress... I also sampled their Seafood Black Bean noodle (Saam Sun Cha Chiang Mein) dish, which was good, but inferior to Great Sea's version. There was evidence of calamari in the sauce, but it was lacking the gigantic shrimp you find at Great Sea's noodles. We also had the Mapo Tofu (spicy tofu) which was decent, but again inferior to Great Sea's version. We also had the tan soo yuk (sweet and sour beef), which was a lot like how my mom used to make it. There were a sweet sauce drizzled on it, with a saltier dipping sauce on the side. It was good, but nothing too remarkable.  All in all a good meal. I will be returning to try their cchaampong (spicy seafood soup) and maybe their mongolian beef, which I hear good things about.

I think it's the noodles and the fact that they serve kim chi with their crab rangoon (what a revelation!). Talk about bang for your buck: they literally give you a boatload of food. We ordered enough for three meals in total, but the wife (I'm just guessing it's a husband and wife team) didn't pass judgement. Based on the other reviews here, it looks like we need to try some other things. And I know Great Seas has a lot more reviews, but we liked VIP better!",0.9785,0.767,0.2,0.034,0.56875
2010-11-01,4.0,"Finally.  Finally.  Finally.  I have found the best tangsooyuk (beef or pork sweet and sour asian style) in Chicago.  I have been looking for you everywhere, and I've had to sit through plate after plate of sub-par tangsooyuk to find you, but now I've found you.  Fresh deep fried battered beef or pork brought to your table freshly drenched in amazing sweet and sour sauce.  Having the sauce poured fresh allows the beef to retain the crispiness while the sauce soaks in.  Pure sweet tangy goodness.  They give you some soy sauce on the side with it, but I'm not really sure what that's all about - anything that takes away from tangsooyuk sauce should be kept away from the table.  I'm giving this place 5 stars just for the tangsooyuk. As for some of the other dishes, we did NOT try the chachangmyun (black bean noodles) but I hear it is very good.  We did NOT try the champong (hot soup with noodles) but I hear it is decent.  We DID try the kkanpongi (spicy chicken wings) and I found the sauce to be good, but the chicken to be a little dry/ overcooked, and the amount of meat on the bones were less than the other 'unnamed' wing place down the street on Lawrence.  We also tried the mapo tofu, which was good, but they didn't give us the option for having beef in the tofu sauce... I'm not a vegetarian, I need meat.  If you don't give me the option for meat, I get angry, and you won't like me when I'm angry.  Finally, one unnamed person in our group decided to not fill out our order with chchangmyun/champong as we requested, and instead decided to order, yep, beef and broccoli.  Beef and fricking broccoli.  Guess which dish was left only half eaten at the end of the mean?  Yup, the beef and broccoli.  If you're going to VIP, don't order beef and broccoli - not because it's subpar, but just because there is so much better there to order.   Service is good, and water was always full.  Ample parking outside. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the items other than the tangsooyuk only distracted from the tangsooyuk.  Do not miss out on the tangsooyuk.",0.9939,0.809,0.151,0.04,0.5715145502645503

The inside is a total different story. VIP has the Chinatown feeling on the northwest side I was looking for. You know its going to be authentic good Chinese when the place with packed Asian families. The egg rolls were really good and fresh. I ordered the Sweet and sour chicken (Beef tang soo ook) which was huge and came in a boat! My only complaint about the dish is there is too much batter and not enough beef. Otherwise it was a great unique dish I enjoyed. Its also BYOB (no fee) so you can grab a bottle from the store a block east. Wife ordered the mongolian beef which was also delish and huge portions. Swapped rice for homemade noodles. The dishes are around $10 and $7 for lunch. Nice gem for the area and will be back to try the soup.,0.9843,0.773,0.2,0.027,0.5617132867132866
2010-03-18,4.0,"3.5 stars really... but i'll push it to 4 for the sake of Yelp averaging. I ordered the often yelped about egg rolls and cha chiang mein (noodles with black bean sauce) for dinner last night. Total for pick up was around $11.50. Not too bad or pricey. I thought the black bean sauce was AMAZING. it really opened my eyes to a new type of sauce. However, the noodles tasted like they had been cooked about 2 hours earlier. And, while I appreciate them being served seperately to maintain a better overall consistency. It was kind of gross to look at them standing alone. But, once mixed with the mild, sweet black bean sauce, all was forgiven. It was a really exceptional dish. And, I would go back and order it again and again. I also, not sure if this is appropriate or not, mixed the kimchi they provided me, into the dish. I liked how the pickled turnip gave a nice crunch to the softness of the noodles. That's probably not the traditional way to enjoy the dish though. The egg rolls were good. They were fresh. You could tell they are made on site. But, they just weren't my kind of egg rolls. These were a pork based egg roll that were really heavy on the pork. For some that's a good thing. For me, I like an egg roll that's equal parts cabbage, bean sprouts and chopped bbq pork. This was more of a ground pork. And I found them kind of small. They were actually a good size for an appetizer. I just look for an egg roll to be monstrous, almost chipotle size. These were not. But, still I thought, a good value. I would recommend, even though they were not my preference. Overall a good experience.

Nothing bad, but nothing great either. The soup that came with it was a bland egg drop noodle sort of deal.

So I grew up near Lawrence and Kimball and every Korean family that lived in the area would go to this joint.   One of my favorites is the noodle combo that some people have described - the jajangmyung (black bean paste noodle dish) and jampong (spicy, seafood noodle dish).  My mouth is watering just writing about it.   The jajangmyung sauce has such so much flavor.  I love how when you take a bite you taste all the flavors - the meat, seafood and onions.   The jampong broth also has a rich flavor - it has the depth of a homemade chicken soup with the subtle hint of seafood and spice. The spice does not overwhelm you.  It's perfect. The tansuyuk the fried pork or beef with the sweet and sour sauce you can drizzle on it is so tasty.  I don't know if it's the marinade of the meat or just the good quality meat or the way it's fried - whatever it is, it's addictive.
