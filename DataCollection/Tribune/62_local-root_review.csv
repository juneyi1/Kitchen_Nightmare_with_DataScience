2016-07-28,5.0,It is a very sad day when such a breathtaking inventive and creative masterpiece joined this clueless area of streeterville. Every morning you could see the master chef rolling dough and making mouth watering croissants like from France. The jam and butter was so pure like all of the items! I truly loved the deconstructed eggs Benedict and roasted potatoes. The hamburgers were like heavenly seasoned meat patties! You will be missed and many thanks to Chef Isaac for bringing his love of locally sourced food to my former area. Hopefully you will open up something in west loop where the people will appreciate the beauty of your food.,0.9892,0.626,0.318,0.057,0.5607142857142857

After reading the menu in the foyer, we were pretty disappointed to discover that not only was the full service menu smaller which means we had to change what we had settled on but they were out of two of the remaining menu items items my fam of four wanted. It took around 40 minutes to get out meal. Eldest daughter thought my French toast was better than what she was served, I got a hash that I couldn't even finish because it was swimming in grease (I purposely left the grease puddle in the middle and the hash scraped on the outside but nothing was said / demerit for server). The portions were also quite small fir what we received.  Lesson learned...never again. I'll wait an hour for yolk or Wildberry next time I'm in town.",0.5859,0.899,0.062,0.039,0.4735294117647058

The food was locally sourced so everything tasted fresh.  I ordered crab cakes and this by far surpassed all the other places in Chicago where I've had this dish.  They have the crunchiest exterior and when biting into the cakes, they had a nice chewiness - it was fresh!  And the waiter wasn't joking when he mentioned this dish was spicy, it had a kick. I washed the food down with an iced tea.  I think it was a peach iced tea which was the tastiest even though it wasn't sweetened.  The aroma of the fruits in the drink made me happy. Now, minus some points for the panna cotta.  Hello!?!?!  This needs works.  I'm thinking about the panna cotta dish I had back in New York and the panna cotta at Local Root was lacking.  I was cheating a little by having sugar but I honestly didn't feel bad about it because I didn't finish it.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  It could have used more fruit preserve topping.  Improve the desserts please!",0.9878,0.804,0.179,0.017,0.5453222703222702
2016-01-29,2.0,"Alright, so I appreciate the whole ""farm to table"" concept. I'm all for it. In my experience these types of places are quick, have a robust food menu, and stellar customer service. Things I liked: the ambiance, and their in-house sodas. Spunky. Now let's get into my grievances with this spot: We opted for this place today after learning they had a Restaurant Week Lunch Menu. For $22, the selection was pretty bleak. My butternut squash soup was good and portabella mushroom sandwich was tasty (goat cheese made it flavorful, otherwise it would've just been ""meh""). Service was so ridiculously slow-- we were sitting around idly for 40 minutes during our lunch hour, waiting for the third course. I had selected an Apple Fritter but asked for it to be packed. When I opened it up to eat just now, it looked half eaten. Regardless of whether or not it was, the portion size was meager, at best. Really lame deal for $22. Especially upset by our experience here today because one of my friends is gluten-free, and she had specified her restriction to the waiter upon ordering. Lo and behold, her plate came out with potatoes touching her omelette (potatoes shouldn't have even been on the plate, it's all gluten!). Sure, they corrected their mistake... but it took over 15 minutes. In principle, it should have been deducted from the bill, but I won't get into that. All in all, was hoping for a better experience... but won't bother going back.",0.9584,0.823,0.125,0.052,0.558641975308642
2016-01-10,4.0,"I like that there's finally an organic focused restaurant downtown. There could be some improvements and some things made me hesitant trust the place. For example, I called and asked what oil they cook with and they said an olive oil canola blend. Then I asked if the canola was certified organic. They looked for a certification and said ""yes, it says non-GMO"" not realizing that non-GMO and certified organic are not the same. I was concerned about why an organic focused restaurant wouldn't know the difference.  When I went into eat, the waitress told me the meats were all organic. But, I brought up that some of the farms I recognized and those weren't certified organic. She clarified they weren't all certified organic but that the farms do followed organic practices. I wish she was more upfront about how they were defining organic, it just seemed a little sneaky. I was left wondering if the farms really did follow ALL organic practices. I understand that verification costs money and like the idea of supporting non-certified but organic practicing farms, but the way the waitress said it made it seem like she didn't know what certified organic meant which made me wonder if she knew what organic practices were. The restaurant seemed to focus more on the local aspect than the organic aspect.  I enjoyed my steak. The bread pudding was great. I'd like to support more organic focused places.

2016-01-07,5.0,"Wow! I'm really glad that I didn't check the reviews before going to Local Root! I was driving my son to the airport and we were trying to find a lunch place that served clean, tasty organic options (besides the cafe in Whole Foods). My son ordered a mocha coffee drink which was rich & delicious and I started with some Jasmine Tea which you get at least 2 full cups of in the pot. I'm self admittedly a tea snob and a stickler for organic tea. The selection was fun and my choice was soooo good - like a warm hug - very satisfying! He ordered a burger - after the first bite he was interrupted from inhaling it only to say how amazing it was. Edzo's (Burgers) in Evanston is an excellent option for grass fed and organic beef burgers, truffle fries etc , and finding this place was a real treat. He said the burger tasted like it had truffle in it. It was served with home made chips as well. I ordered the beet/arugula/goat cheese salad with candied walnuts and a piece of salmon on the side. The salad was fresh, the dressing was perfect and the salmon was moist and extremely tasty (I'm craving it right now). This place will definitely be a ""go to"" place when in the area. I'm not sure about these other mixed reviews, I just know we had excellent meals as well as friendly attentive service.

I respect what they're trying to do with local, organic food - but for me, the taste just wasn't there. I ordered apple cinnamon french toast for brunch, and it just wasn't good - the apple compote was good, but there wasn't much of it, and the french toast itself was very dry and flavorless. I added a lot of whipped cream (which was fantastic) to make it work. My side of bacon was quite tasty, but my friend was also underwhelmed with her breakfast burrito - it needed something to liven it up. She asked for sour cream (they didn't have any) and settled for salsa, which helped but didn't redeem the dish.  I understand why the prices are higher, and I know that, in theory, the quality of ingredients is probably higher.

We didn't say anything bc we had plenty of food. And we were not charged for it at the end, so no corrections were necessary.  Then we had 4 different entrees. I had the pork loin, others had sandwiches and salad. Everyone seem satisfied with their food. I thought the pork loin was good but just a little dry. I almost expected that when I ordered since stuffed pork is hard to do perfectly.  Really likes the atmosphere of the place. I would come back to try their brunch if I was in the area. Don't think I would for dinner since it is a smallish bistro menu and my group of 4 probably ate half the menu in one sitting.

2015-09-02,5.0,"My husband and I have a great deal of food allergies, and were very skeptical about finding a caterer for our belated wedding reception who could compassionately and patiently work with us to provide a menu that would allow us to enjoy everything, without compromising taste and quality. After timidly sending email inquiries to a handful of local vendors, I was overwhelmed with gratitude when I received a response from Local Root, enthusiastically advising me that they would easily be able to work with us. From day one, the Catering Manager, Bruce, was a joy to work with. He responded promptly to emails and phone calls, reiterated everything in writing that we spoke about by phone, and did everything he could to accommodate our hyper-specific requests calmly, like they weren't strange or high maintenance. He was also extremely organized, and quick to make suggestions when we brainstormed about the menu and presentation. Shortly after exchanging a few emails, Bruce invited us to have lunch with he and the chef, Isaac, to discuss the event. Not only did we come up with a menu that met our needs, but they agreed to accommodate our request of sourcing bread and pasta from two additional, out-of-state vendors, and serving the home brew my husband makes, worked with us to identify and order the specific, deli-style packaging we wanted, and allowed us to provide labels we designed to apply to the containers. The day before the event, I went to the restaurant to drop off the sourced bread, pasta, and food labels (which a handful of kind staff people offered to carry in for me), and Isaac invited me to the kitchen to taste some of the ingredients that would be used in the food for our party. It was really rewarding to see how many items were from local sources, and the quality was evident in the flavors I was able to sample. It was also a wonderful opportunity to see how much care was going into our event, and how passionate Isaac is about what he does. On the day of the party, the catering team did a fantastic job of setting up the buffet (of sandwiches, salads and chips), walking our guests through making their selections, and clearing everything out before the end of the evening. Both Bruce and Isaac took the time to stop by the venue to make sure everything was to our liking. We were also able to tip the staff by phone a few days after the party, instead of having to deal with doling out cash after our reception, when we were frazzled with getting everything out of the venue in time. The food was exceptional. From the bottled sodas created in-house, to the three flavors of handmade potato chips, to the roast beef made on the premises specifically for our sandwiches, everything was delicious, and very much enjoyed by our guests. We're so very grateful for the time, effort and attention to detail that Isaac, Bruce, and their team were able to provide. They were understanding, gracious, and showed that they really cared about the quality of our experience, even though we were probably especially difficult to work with due to all our restrictions (which they treated very seriously). Thank you Local Root for alleviating so much anxiety, and delivering excellent food and service.

I think it's probably nice enough inside, but my friends and I appreciated sitting outside, on one of the 12 Chicago days that we're able to. The taste: We got some breakfast skillets....and they weren't bad, but they were overpriced for what they were, and they weren't amazing. This place obviously prides itself on highlighting local products. My New Yorker friend hated the ketchup. It lacks high fructose corn syrup, and to him, any flavor that he could tolerate. We suggested that he walk around with his own bottle of heinz going forward, but in this moment, he had to, in his opinion suffer through the less than palatable midwestern ketchup. I didn't think it was as terrible, but it was a flavor I wasn't used to and didn't particularly enjoy.  The mushrooms in the veggie skillet - those stood out as juicy, flavorful, delicious. But the main ""vegetable?"" in the skillet was potatoes. I guess when I'm going to a place to experience local cuisine, I don't get that excited about local potatoes. Maybe that's just me, but there were so many potatoes, and I would have rather had a skillet highlighting other veggies. My face: A little let down. I think we each paid around $25 for our respective dishes, with coffee, which was almost worth the $4. I get it, intelligensia, that's what it costs, and it's good, so okay.

Everyone else's food came out. They brought out an omelet for me, but it wasn't what I ordered. I had to tell two people the my food was missing. The server eventually stopped by and stated that it was forgotten and needed to be finished (not her fault). They brought out the omelet I ordered, but I had subbed out for fruit which they forgot. It was dropped off very quickly and I couldn't get the servers attention before she walked away. No one came back very quickly so I was unable to ask them to fix it. I also had toast and was not brought any jam or butter.  It was just a dry piece of bread (can I not have jelly with my $15 omelet?) Food was okay. It wasn't the best I had. Not sure it was worth all of the hassle. They need more servers. The one we had was friendly but so busy that it was hard to get what I ordered. Tracking down a server was hard.

It was too slow though but I think it was because she was pretty much the only one covering the other tables, but sometimes she was simply nowhere in sight.  You can tell that food here is supposed to be healthy and locally sourced - it actually reminds me of certain places out in the West where this is a pretty big deal. I got the Champagne chicken sandwich - chicken was pretty dry but I enjoyed the tomato jam and the brioche bread. My sister got the pulled pork benedict which we both expected to taste better given that it's supposed to be one of their most frequently ordered items. I didn't get the smoky, pulled pork flavor I wanted. Overall the flavors of their dishes are pretty toned down compared to the average American food which is fine if that's what you're expecting. Then again, I was not expecting the ketchup to taste like pasta sauce. There was no thickness to it at all!  I do think that prices are on the higher end and it would be better to drop it down by about two dollars. My chicken sandwich was simply not worth the $12, even if you throw in the quality of the ingredients (and well, the chicken was dry).",0.9914,0.799,0.173,0.028,0.5128863826232246

Upon arrival there were people sitting outside and a few inside. We were greeted and immediately seated. I ordered the bottomless mimosa ($19) not realizing you could order by the glass ($8). Sounds good right? Yeah. Well when my glass was filled to the top with champagne and only a teaspoon of pineapple juice, I knew my liver was in trouble. Lol joking. FYI: The mimosa's come with freshly squeezed with OJ but I'm not a big fan of OJ so I asked for pineapple juice. But along with the glass was a carafe of champagne and pineapple juice mixed together. I couldn't finish the entire carafe and was unable to be charged for only a glass so be sure your order is correct when it's placed. For food I ordered the breakfast skillet which came with 2 eggs cooked your style, potatoes, caramelized onions, spinach (yum!) and mushrooms. You can add meat for an extra $4. I added bacon. It was good but  lacked a little flavor. I guess being from the south I'm used to bold flavors and this was kind of bland. Overall, I added some hot sauce and finished my meal.

And waited. We were talking and enjoying our friends company and then we realized we'd been waiting 20 minutes and we still had no drinks!

I had the pulled pork benedict and a latte and both were great.  The pulled pork was nicely cooked and flavorful and the potatoes were crispy and well seasoned.  At $14 for the benedict the prices are a little steep, but brunch in general in the city is expensive, and yolk's regular benedict is $12.49 (cheapest around here is West egg at 10.50)  so it's comparable for better food, delicious pulled pork instead of canadian bacon and a better atmosphere.

Service was extremely slow from the kitchen.  We ordered at 11:45 and our food took about 45 minutes.  I asked the waitress on status and she told me ""good food takes time"".  I'd agree except that two three tops that seated and ordered after us got their food before us.  Clearly, something is amiss with their queuing.  The physical amount of time to cook the food should have been 15 min tops, this was definitely a order of operation issue.   2. Overall, the food experience was underwhelming.  I ordered the chicken and waffles special based on reviews here.  The waffle was burnt.  The chicken was a skin on-bone-in chicken breast that looked like it it was just deep fried.  No breading, no seasoning, and no brining so it was dry. 3. Our waitress was non-existent between the time we ordered until the food came.  Once the food came, she checked on us every five minutes to see if everything was ok.  Nice gesture but more frequent communication while we were waiting for our food would have been nice.

2015-04-08,1.0,"STOP REMOVING MY REVIEW! My review got removed because I wrote a haiku.  Then it got removed because it had ""personal info""  Nothing redeeming Sad, seems like a good idea All was vinegar ***BTW menu still says 7 am on the website**** We were looking for a breakfast spot that was open early as we had an event we had to attend at 8:30 am. Checked yelp, looked at your online menu - all said breakfast started at 7 am. We arrived at 7:20 am. Was told breakfast did not start serving until 8 am. ""Would we like a pastry?"" Nope, can't. We needed to have breakfast before this event and pastries were not going to work. I looked again at the yelp and at your website - everything said 7 am - as well as the menus on the host stand. So I asked the server, everything says 7 am - we really would like to have breakfast here and we are on a tight schedule. He asked the chef, chef said ok, he could make us something. Server #2 now comes to give us our water, and we want to order. He says no, breakfast does not start until 8 am. Ok, at this point, very frustrated. We just talked to Server #1 and apparently he can't communicate to Server #2. We were ready to just go but we continued on - really need food this morning. We expressed as much to #2. And now a huge discussion takes place. Instead of just asking us what we would like to have and going back and talking to the chef. Finally we place our order. The Chef's favorite - Pulled Pork Benedict. It arrives at 8:15 am. And it tastes like vinegar. I realize some chefs use vinegar as a shortcut to poaching eggs but the eggs should not taste completely of vinegar. On top of that the BBQ sauce on the pulled pork is also heavy on the vinegar. We left 2/3 of the meal on our plate. At this point we could not complain any more. We just wanted breakfast - the most important meal of the day. And when we said fine to the server's question, ""how was it?"" - any server worth a dime would know nothing about that meal was fine. And Server #2 also acted very sharp, like vinegar. Thus ""all was vinegar."" Now I really wanted to like the place. So I finally ordered a pastry. A chocolate croissant for the road. It was terrible. Heavy, oily. Threw it out. Thus ""nothing redeeming."" I don't know what to tell you about the food. I'm happy to disagree on that. I rarely write reviews anymore - only really good or really really bad. I hate writing bad review. But, a lot could have been fixed by the service at the time - I would not have written this review if the servers were better trained.

WAAAAY to expensive for unimpressive food.  I came here with a friend for Restaurant week. The space, while somewhat awkwardly located in the midst of hotels and navy pier, was very cute and welcoming and the staff was all super friendly and charming. I'm vegetarian (my friend is not) and they were very aware and helpful regarding that. The quinoa and kale salad that I started with might've been my favorite part. There were mushrooms, zesty-lemony quinoa, and nice bits of kale. My friends parsnip bisque was rich, though not memorable. I got the Golden Eggplant Tower as a main course and it was just meh. The eggplant was deep fried and while the two pieces sandwiched spinach and goat cheese, I couldn't really taste those things. I actually gave most to my friend and ate all of the broccoli that accompanied it (as that was perfectly done). My friend had the trout - the portions looked meager. Honestly, we both thought we needed salt - but there was no salt in sight. (And I'm not a person who usually reaches for extra seasoning). For dessert, she had the bread pudding which resembled something more like a cobbler. Not super sweet, but pretty good. I had the flourless chocolate cake, which was cold and moussy. Good, but didn't stand out. We each had a cocktail (taking the advice from our server) - but honestly, they were no where near as special as I thought they should be for $12-$14 a pop. (I frequent the Violet Hour and if they can make me magic in a glass for $13, other places need to step it up!). Also, the beer was all marked about $2 higher than what you'd find in most places. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and our server was a delight. I really want to support places that cook with locally sourced food. But there's NO way that I could justify the portions/boring-ness of the food with the price.   The experience was okay, but it's unlikely that I'll be back unless I'm unusually in the area for something.

Upon entering- you are greeted with a huge blackboard that tells you just how far the various ingredients are sourced from where you stand.  Good for today's consumer who is more interested than ever about where their food comes from. We were seated at a table in the front booth and began to look at the menu.  Interesting that the alcohol menu has more real estate than does the food. Our server came over and steered us toward a few of his favorites, the pulled pork sandwich with jalepenos, the poutine with pulled pork,the mac and cheese with pulled pork and the vegetable soup.  Ha!  I think there was a pulled pork theme going on! Of all of our entrees- the best was the pulled pork sandwich on a soft brioche roll.  The fried jalepenos on it added just the right kick.  The mac and cheese lacked really any flavor and the poutine was a sad attempt at what should have been a decadent indulgence! The hand cut fries were way over cooked and tasted more like shoestrings.  And when we brought it to the manager's attention, I thought he might replace them or take them off the bill, but that didn't happen. I also think the place lacks personality.  The server and the manager never cracked even a smile or seemed welcoming.  It was almost a little awkward when the manager came to our table. All in all, I think the concept is interesting.  But the food was just okay at least on the day we stopped in.  Ha!  Maybe we should have ordered something from the bar!",0.9594,0.859,0.105,0.036,0.5072751322751322

Asked for toast and waiter said "" oh, did you want toast with your eggs""? We responded yes, it comes with toast according to the menu.  Ten minutes later after two inquiries as to where is the toast, the waiter brought one piece of bread cold, not toasted. We informed waiter we both needed toast, NOT bread and that our eggs are now cold. When toast finally arrived after another five minutes, there was no butter.

We appreciate you got the message and generally had a good experience.  While we do, in fact, serve a fair number of kids, it's true that we don't have a children's menu with most parents choosing to order a small plate option, share a meal or take the unfinished portion home. We've had very good success with this and haven't had any feedback to the contrary. However, you raise a point and we will evaluate whether we should offer a few kids selections on a special menu.

2014-07-10,3.0,"This review is for a delivery order. I was excited when I found this place.  I'm a picky eater.  I typically follow the paleo diet, but in a real sense where I actually care where the food comes from so finding a place that shared the farms where they source their food was refreshing because I could actually go to the sites of those farms to confirm that the meat is actually grass-fed, organic, etc. I ordered the Steak Frites and substituted the fries with a side salad. I was excited for a hearty flank steak.  Well my first mistake was thinking ordering a steak for a delivery order was going to go well.  Lesson learned.  The steak was cold when it arrived (not surprisingly), but it wasn't a flank steak.  It was actually a skirt steak.  Some people would have flipped...I was actually pretty happy about it except if it were my restaurant I would have called the customer to make sure it was okay and that they didn't want to change their order.  Seems like customer service 101 to me. Also, you are paying for the quality of food.  The Steak Frites runs about $25.  The quality of the food was up to par, but I'm thinking I'll be hungry again in an hour or so.  This is also typical of restaurants that serve well sourced food because it's more expensive.  Next time I'll probably go to Whole Foods and cook the food myself.  I wish I was more excited about this because the choices for high quality food in Chicago are very limited.   If I give them another shot, I'll probably go to the restaurant to compare, but based on my first impression, I'm inclined to check out other options or stick to cooking my own meals.",0.9905,0.828,0.149,0.023,0.5252239229024943

There were three of us, and we all had a small plate and a larger entree. Ever since I went to Montreal, I have become obsessed with poutine. I'm picky. The fries were fantastic, the flavor of the gravy was great, I just wish there had been more of it. There seemed to be just a little schmear of it on the bottom of the bowl and the dish would have really soared had there been just a little more over the fries. The mac and cheese, was a little under-seasoned, it would have benefited from a touch of salt. I had the scallops, paired with a vegetable puree and some sauteed greens. The scallops were outstanding. The plate went for about 20 something dollars, but the scallops were enormous and bursting with flavor. No grit, solid searing, buttery texture and an almost smokey crust. It was delicious. The dessert, was good. It didn't seem like a place that had a lot of specialty dessert items, or a pastry chef. Although, I kind of wanted it to have a pastry program. The desserts receive high marks for flavor, you definitely get what you expect and what you pay for.

I'd been scoping the place out for weeks as it's only a couple blocks from work and on the way to Dollop. After seeing the glorious word, ""Poutine"" written on the window I convinced a co-worker to try it out with me.  Being a seasoned Yelper and bit of a french fry connoisseur, I logged in to read some reviews that seemed promising, and searched for any pictures of french fries I could find. They looked legit, so I was excited to try out their ""Montreal Poutine."" The co-worker got a burger and fries, and I got the aforementioned poutine and a side of brussels and bacon.  Brussels & Bacon - Brussels were under-cooked and would have benefited from a brief roast to bring out a bit of flavor. They tasted boiled and were bitter and slimy. Bacon was ok, but soggy and would have been much, much better if it were crispy.  Fries were atrocious. Seriously. The roof of my mouth feels like I just ate three boxes of Cap'n Crunch with no milk and four baguettes, crust-only.  Poutine as a composed dish was utterly disappointing. No gravy to be seen, a smidge of cheese, and a couple fried sage leaves. I had to ask for ketchup twice to get enough moisture on the fries to make them palatable. Even my co-worker's fries went largely untouched as they were too hard to eat. And home girl loves her french fries.  Service was also slooooooooooow when there were only about 3 other tables in the entire restaruant during lunch and it still took us over an hour to get in and out. If you're going to advertise poutine in your window, and claim that these fries are the ""best in Chicago"" on your website, then you had better deliver. Unfortunately, this place is a major no-go.

My husband and I were in Chicago for the weekend, and I wanted to find a TRULY LOCAL restaurant - why go to Chicago and eat food that was flown/trucked in from everywhere but Chicago? We were blown away by our experience here. In fact, we ended up enjoying two of our four meals out at Local Root. We would've eaten there more, but we didn't want to frighten the waitstaff. My favorite part of the restaurant is its premise - ""passionate sourcing."" When you go, ask the waitstaff about it. The owner/chef personally seeks out his sources, knows his farmers, and supports these honest small businesses. In turn, the food is honest and DELICIOUS. A fantastic experience. I only wish we had our own Local Root back at home. We went for a late lunch on Saturday. Our server was very knowledgeable and passionate about the premise of the restaurant and the menu items. It was extremely difficult for me to select what to enjoy for my meal. All of the menu items looked delicious, and knowing that they were sourced honestly made me feel confidently about choosing anything that struck my fancy. I ended up ordering the House Salad after seeing someone else order it - greens, cherry tomatoes, pickled red onions, croutons, and a coffee bean-infused balsamic vinaigrette - YUM! My husband got the Cheddar and Chorizo flatbread with salsa verde. Delicious. GENEROUS PORTIONS. I'm so glad he let me steal a few bites.  We came back for a spectacular brunch the next morning. We both got omelets - I got the Mushroom, with goat cheese and caramelized onions. My husband got the Sausage and Spinach, with house chorizo and aged cheddar. I got the fruit with mine, and my husband got the breakfast potatoes. SO GOOD!!! The mimosa and bloody Mary were fantastic. We had a cup of their coffee - rich, smooth, and delicious. We closed the meal with a couple of pastries - an apple fritter and a fabulous pumpkin muffin. The staff was great, and we got to meet the chef and manager.

I love that the food is delicious and conscientiously brought from local farm to table.  Every dollar is a vote, and this is the kind of business I like to support.  They bake their baked goods fresh, on-site, and the cookies are like ahmagawd.  I honestly can't remember ever having a better snickerdoodle or oatmeal raisin cookie.  I would come just for the cookies.   I'm a huge coffee lover and did not like the coffee.  Why is it so hard to brew a good cup of coffee?  The creamer was thin and I asked if it was half 'n' half because it wasn't very fatty or creamy.  The waiter said yes, that maybe it's different from commercial half n half because it's local.  ?  Mmkay.  Either way, not that great.  Plus the coffee got cold which is kind of gross if it's not iced, and it took a long time for him to come by and top off with hot coffee.  Then he forgot more cream.  I had to ask for more cream twice.  I used to wait tables - every time a customer had to seek me out and ask me for something it was a sign to me that I wasn't doing my job well.  I'm sorry, there is no excuse here either - there were maybe five tables with customers, total, so it's not like they were slammed.  Everyone has different strengths; waiting tables is not easy.  Not everyone can do it.

2013-09-03,4.0,"I really like Local Root. I am not a Chicagoan, but if I were, I would like to think I'd spend a lot of time at Local Root. During my last two visits, I've made time for a really delicious boozy lunch and a pre-airport brunch, and I've really enjoyed both times. The only difference that seemed to have occurred in the six months between those visits relates to the efficiency of the two servers, but that might also be the difference between a 2PM Friday lunch and a 9:30 Labor Day Monday brunch. And though our Labor Day experience was a little slow, it certainly wasn't bad, and there was no wait for a table, so at least we were sipping coffee (or really excellent Chai from their house-made spice tea mixture). The first time, our waitress was a delight: very nice, very knowledgeable, and very flexible, allowing us even to move to a larger table after finishing our meal when we were joined by a couple others for drinks. Foodwise, Local Root is a delicious brunch-y type spot. The first time, I had a lamb sausage meal that was absolutely divine. It is not presently on the menu, but should it return, I recommend it wholeheartedly. The second time, I had their chilaquiles, and it was seriously good. Like rivaling my favorite spot in Austin, TX for chilaquiles. If you like Mexican brunch, give this a try. It has both red and green salsas, a big slab of fluffy eggs, and a bowl full of tortilla-y goodness and potatoes. It's quite a meal, but it's something of which I fear I would eat way too much if I had regular access. I've also tried one of their lunch special quiches, which was warm, fluffy, fresh, and had genuinely good crust, and their mushroom and goat cheese omelet. Unlike so many omelets, this was not dried out or boring; it was scrumptious and creamy in texture, and the goat cheese and mushrooms were a perfect taste sensation with the eggs. Drinks-wise, they do have bottomless mimosas, which are fresh and delightful. I've also had their bloody mary, and it certainly rivaled some of the better marys I've had, in part because of its bacon garnish. They also have bacon-infused bourbon drinks some of the time which are delicious and very unlike the hammy versions one occasionally gets. I'd say Local Root is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and certainly would be my spot to hit up regularly if, well, I could be there.",0.999,0.706,0.262,0.032,0.483901098901099

A business breakfast here was a total and utter disaster.   The coffee came and smelled delicious but the cream we were offered was clearly curdled.  Not only did mine have chunks of nastiness floating around in it, but there was grime and an oily slickness.  We were told that ""we must not know what organic cream looks like.""  No alternatives were offered and the coffee, despite being $4 each and left untouched by us, were not removed from the bill. My $14 omelet was average at best, and did not contain any of the ""fresh local herbs"" it claimed on the menu.  $14 was just way too much money for 2 eggs  and some cheese served with some dried out cantaloup.   The $4 side order of sausage was inedibly dry.  Not overcooked, but an awful design.  Also sent back after spitting out one bite of one piece.   The toast was modestly tasty, and I made the majority of my meal of it. My bloody mary olives were skewered along side dried cranberry's.  I'm not much of a prude, but what gives with that.  Fortunately I could simply pick them off and toss them into my undrank coffee.

He asked if we had been there before and he answered all of our questions.  They had a nice menu with vegetarian options; which was nice. I ordered the veggie baguette. It came out fast and it was delicious! Very unique with cooked veggies and figs. The fries were good too!  The waiter asked if we wanted dessert, but we were all stuffed (good portions, I had to take some home). He gave us the check and some free cookies since it was our first time. We ate them later that day, and they were really nice. I love this place and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Wish we had one in Philly!",0.9907,0.76,0.24,0.0,0.7104166666666667

I work as concierge near Local Root and constantly send guests over for breakfast, lunch, and dinner because it's a nice alternative to all the main stream dining spots.  I was told concierge received discounts and I even presented my business card to the host, but the message must not have been relayed to the waitress as I didn't get any breaks :/   Those thoughts aside, the outdoor patio seating is nice and the menu is unique with a variety of veg and non-veg options for dinner. Food tasted good (stuffed portabella yum) and healthy (at least in comparison to other restaurants).  The service was a little slow considering the place wasn't too busy so my advice is to go here only if you have an hour - hour and a half of time to allow, not if you're in a hurry!",0.892,0.878,0.101,0.021,0.5310185185185186

Plus, I can look right at the board behind the register and see where the eggs and butter in those scones originated.  I also enjoyed the selection of teas. The person making my iced tea on my first visit told me exactly how long it needed to steep before I bought it, so I would know I was in for a wait before I made a commitment. He also let me smell the teas when making my selection. Fancy! Everyone here was super friendly on that visit, too. I heard three hellos when I entered and had the door held for me by bus staff as I left.

When some raindrops threatened we left so quickly that I wasn't able to ask about the falsly identified cheeses.  We finished our evening elsewhere.

It took a while to get food, and the bus boys/food runners had no idea what they were doing. WHen we asked what was being served on the charcuterie board the guy acted like he had no idea what we were talking about. Another guy came up to us to try to take our dishes when we were actually still eating. We were also sitting outside and he tried to take the plates from the outside of the planters that bordered the outside area. We thought it was a random person just trying to take them . Ambience: Have only eaten outside, but there were plants in our face from the planters, and our table was wobbly and on an incline.  Food: very small portions for the price, the waitress kept saying what we ordered was enough but it wasnt. My first time me and my boyfriend split the montreal poutine, and 2 flat breads. The poutine was extremely small and mainly fries. There was just a bit of cheese curds melted on top (maybe 2 or 3) and I didnt even see gravy. The lamb sausage flat bread was small plain flat bread with a few small pieces of lams sausage and same with the prosciutto. We were still starving afterwards! Our second visit we split the charcuterie board which had lamb bacon which was good, and 2 types of sausages. It was very small also. The cheeses were a soft cheese that was great and a few pieces of 2 other cheeses. Our waitress said a salad with chicken would be enough for a meal but it was definitely not. I had the strawberry and pea tendril salad, which was mainly spinach and strawberries, with 2 pea tendrils 2 chunks of parmasan cheese, a few walnuts, and a few pieces of chicks. Not substantial for at least $13 even after the small $20 charcuterie board. My boyfriend had the short rib which did taste great, but had a ton of mashed potatos and salty gravy.

Our dishes took a really long time to get out to us (we saw two other tables nearby show up after us and their dishes show up before ours), and the Huevos Rancheros were seriously the worst I've ever had in my life. Who makes huevos rancheros by cooking the eggs omelet-style without anything in it and then plopping it onto tortillas with bland black beans and overdone chorizo? Local Root, tsk tsk. even if the ingredients were quality, leaving them out too long made for an overall awful texture and taste experience that was supposed to be brunch. My boyfriend's biscuits and gravy were also pretty blah. That's ALL we ordered - no juice, coffee, tea, nothing, and the entire brunch ended up being $36 with tax and tip. Why would I pay so much when I could get a better breakfast at a Golden Nugget? I'm not even exaggerating. Luis, our waiter was probably the one bright spot in the entire meal.

2013-02-15,1.0,"I moved to Chicago two years ago and have really enjoyed exploring all the options Chicago has to offer. Local Root won the award for the worst dining experience so far. For the fairly expensive wine pairing menu I ordered Oyster mushroom ginger soup, Flank Steak and the chocolate cake. First of all - there are no descriptions on the menu, and the I saw no evidence of the creative, locale-vore, farm to table ethos that seems proudly pasted on their concept page. I did however experience recycled, over cooked left overs and the smallest piece of ""flank steak"" I have ever seen , anywhere in the world. The soup had been cooked so long there was no longer any ginger flavor left. However they managed to concentrate a nice bite that hits the back of your throat like a harsh chemical forcing you to cough. I had my girlfriend try it to make sure it wasn't just me - she coughed on queue. I later watched it hit other unsuspecting patrons later in the evening. Armed with a relatively small soup spoon, I really tried to figure out how to make bite size pieces from the 6"" long over cooked brown ""greens"" in my soup. The oyster mushrooms - I think there were at least three small slices weren't fresh and had lost there distinct flavor. Our waitress tried to bring oysters originally as she suggested we have. Seems to me she was focused on what to sell rather than listen closely. Also - shame on the management for putting oysters and oyster mushroom next to each other on a small menu - you are just asking for confusion with inexperienced staff. Second - my much anticipated ""Flank Steak"" was to arrive. I was in Chicago - maybe these guys are using some great grass fed beef from a bio-diverse farm in Wisconsin. Exciting -   now imagine: a Snickers Bar made of beef and pre sliced like a tiny baguette ~ that was the ""steak"". A joke - an inexpensive appetizer at much nicer restaurants...  Really??!!!  At this point I knew I had been taken for a rather pricey ride down sucker lane. Chocolate cake - whatever - a square from a sheet cake - Really?, you couldn't figure out a nice layer cake a bring a classy looking wedge for a $50 pairing? Sure this didn't all come from Dominics or Jewel? This place gives this concept a bad name. I have eaten at farm to table - waste free restaurants in small towns around the country that put this place to shame at a quarter of the price. This place is by far the worst! Also, for under $10 the restaurant could invest in some dimmer switches to ease the cafeteria feel -  If its supposed to be a cafeteria then shame on you for overcharging for bad food, amateur service, and a concept that is nonexistent",0.9344,0.791,0.118,0.091,0.4967320261437908
2013-02-15,2.0,"Love the location and decor but the arrangement and organization of the space lacks direction and purpose. I felt like we were in a Panera. Service was polite and there was no lack of effort (which is why they get two stars, not one) although additional training would certainly benefit the staff. For instance, empty glasses, bottles, and dishes sat on the table for some time even though servers stopped by to check on us several times; and when they did pick up empties, they would pick up some but overlook the rest. My drink sat empty for one course before I finally asked for another bottle. On to the food... We started with the duck poutine and scallops. The scallops were fantastic but some of the duck on the poutine was terribly dry. We ordered the blue cheese and mozzarella flatbread and even watched it being made. The crust was fantastic and it was cooked well, but the mix of cheese was very greasy and the crushed red pepper provided on the side wasn't fresh so it wasn't very spicy. In the end, the flatbread was mediocre at best but it does compel me to return just to try the baked goods.  At this point I'm starting to think the cost for this place's gimmicks (i.e. sustainable, farm-to-table, zero waste, etc.) is consistency. After the second course we went back to looking over the menu. They had a pre-fixe menu the evening we went and for some reason, very few items on the pre-fixe menu appeared on their regular menu. Not wanting to be constrained, we wanted to order a few items from both menus. The chef saw us buried in the menus so he came by to chat. Very polite and nice guy but he was shameless in pushing the pre-fixe entrees so we relented and ordered the flank steak and four cheese ravioli (which he somehow mixed up with the poached salmon when he repeated our order to us). We asked for the steak rare (how we always order our steak) and he suggested we get medium rare because the beef was grass fed. Did this make a difference? Couldn't tell. The staff was very apologetic when the food arrived which was the only reason we realized how long we had been waiting because we were engrossed in conversation.  The chef said it took him hours on end to make the ravioli but I think he meant cook, because the ravioli were beyond stiff, resembling cardboard. Dessert was less than inspired and made me rethink returning for their baked goods. After watching the kitchen staff step outside for several smoke breaks and our waiter put his jacket on and leave for the night, we decided to get up, find someone left on staff, and ask for our check. Final recommendation: Walk the extra blocks west and find food and service that's actually consistent.",0.8568,0.852,0.077,0.071,0.3898754578754579

Having been raised a vegitarian since birth by Rastafarians that grew their own vvegatables, made goat cheese from the herd, got eggs from the coup each morning and skinned fresh caught fish, I can smell a fake wannabe green restaurant from a light year away. No such odor on this block.  The owner behind the bar was glad to offer me samples to ease my curiosity of the plethora of whiskey and I preferred to go with the last one of 3 that he offered up.  Ends up, I have good taste.  Tripple Smoke- Cask strength, small batch whiskey is amazing, go figure it's made by the multi award winning distillery, Corsair.  Which is now one of my favorites. Super nice oakyness and very pleased to have a knowledgable bar keep to talk to.  I can't wait to return",0.9833,0.758,0.193,0.049,0.6367243867243867
2013-01-27,5.0,"Local Root is exactly what Streeterville has been needing! This is a cozy, indie joint with great food. My husband and I have been here twice - once for dinner, and once for lunch - and both were great experiences. For dinner, we went for the $5 cocktail of the day (a Friday special) and shared a few of the small plates - the autumn beet salad, lamb sausage flatbread, brussel sprouts, and brisket poutine (served over Belgian fries; yum!). We couldn't leave without sampling one of the delicious desserts that passed us, and ended up indulging in both the creme brulee and what was supposed to be one delicious cookie, but turned into two (one snickerdoodle, one chocolate chip) thanks to the generosity of the staff. At $70 for what was by anyone's standards TONS of delicious food between the two of us, we felt like we had a fantastic meal.  When we went back for lunch just yesterday, we split the beet salad and a brisket sandwich on brioche (both without realizing we'd ordered similarly last time we were there... whoops). Thankfully, the food is consistently tasty and we were pleasantly surprised by one of the chefs bringing out a complimentary bowl of spinach soup, topped with shittake mushrooms and creme fraiche; we think they were debuting the soup and wanted our opinion... and we loved it! Next time I'm there I'll definitely order that soup if it's still on the menu (they seem to rotate the menu somewhat, seasonally).  I've also had coffee (and a cookie) here with a friend, and it was the perfect spot for a nice chat, complete with a lot more charm than Starbucks next door.  An extra plus of Local Root is that the staff is friendly, laid-back, and prompt. They also have daily specials (something to the effect of $5 glasses of wine on Mondays, 1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesdays, $21 pre-fixe meal on Wednesdays, some discounted pastry/coffee combo on Thursdays, $5 cocktail on Fridays, etc.) Anyhow - so happy to see a spot so unique open on an otherwise drab, canned corner of the neighborhood!",0.9981,0.784,0.216,0.0,0.49082633053221286

We really liked the warm decor and french sax music vibe we were getting, although a hard projection onto the LeftBank in that nice groovy industrial design that we also liked, without some funkier rugs and easy chairs. We ate early for us on a Saturday night, around 7:15 and did a mix of half salads and appetizers including the lamb sausage flatbread that we really liked, with a cup of lamb chili. We also really liked the brussel sprouts side, suitably undercooked with a little char but found the beet salad reduction too sweet, we could have asked for a lemon to cut it. Main courses were the steak and fries and salmon and polenta, which we found disappointing, largely because somebody had gotten the Large salt shaker stuck in their hand for EVERYthing, including the salmon, except the polenta (usually cooked in saltish water:).  Again we could  have asked for a lemon to cut it a little but it really was on the edge of WAY too salty for us. Still it was probably a skirt steak and needs a lot of seasoning and everybody else oversalts their frenchfries so why shouldn't they? But we don't want them to. We look forward to going back, but are going to stick with appetizers and small plates. Decent by the glass wines, we were red that night and the Pinot was the winner. Interested busy young help was very helpful and we managed to mess up their bill, as did they, when we switched to some half plates, and they made it all right no problem. There are many interesting fun recycled touches like your bill being served in an old Oster-Blender cook book that your grandma left you, retro china,  and a fun old recycled candles in the bathrooms. Saw some fantastic looking pastries and scones as we were leaving so this would be a great spot for some early morning coffee. A-OK. Try it.

2013-01-04,2.0,"My fiance and I have been to Local Root close over 10 times since it opened.  When the food is good, it's REALLY good. Unfortunately, the quality is inconsistent and their service is usually pretty....well, bad. What we love: the cheese plate, the fries (I refuse to call them ""frites""...c'mon), and the chocolate chip cookies are pretty amazing. When it comes to service, we've encountered several problems. We generally order their food to go and every time we walk in to order, we have the same guy who does not know their menu. It's a small menu as is and it shouldn't be so difficult to order a cheese plate. I generally order the same few things and sometimes something will be AMAZING and then the next time, it will be terrible. I feel like their staff just ""wings"" it when it comes to some of their dishes. The flat breads frequently come in varying sizes despite the fact that I was never asked what size I want. One night my flatbread will be 12 inches and the next night only 6. Ridiculous.  The last two times I have been there are what have compelled me to write this review.  Two weeks ago I stopped in to order some to-go food and the man taking my order didn't know how to enter in the cheese plate. Instead of politely excusing himself to get help, he looked at me and said, ""I can't do this. It's not you, it's me. Someone else will take care of you."" UMMMMM....did he just break up with me?!?!? It was baffling. Another guy came to take care of me and everything was fine after that but wow.  Last night, I stopped in to LR at 8:30pm to grab some food. Specifically, I wanted 2 of their cheese plates and soup. Simple enough, right? Apparently not. They were closing early b/c they didn't have customers. Well, weird.... pretty sure I was about to spend some $$$, doesn't that make me a customer?? They said they would take a to-go order which was great since that is all I wanted. I started my order asking for the soup and then the cheese plate. I was promptly informed that they couldn't do the cheese plate because their sous chef had left for the night. Again, baffled! I then said, and this is a once in a life time question, ""Can you not cut the cheese yourself?"" The guy went to talk to someone else who worked there and then came back to tell me they could not prepare the cheese plate for me. Whatever. I left. I'll take my $50 and run. As I first mentioned, when the food is good, it's really good, I just don't know if I'm going to risk going there again. I don't want to worry about inconsistent quality or having them close early without clearly posting it somewhere outside. Of course, I do welcome the opportunity to ask about cutting the cheese again, but even that doesn't make it worth it.",0.9907,0.822,0.124,0.054,0.4834682539682541
2013-01-01,1.0,"First the disclaimer: I've carried out of Local Root on a couple occasions and the food was really good. Eggs benedict, farm salad, and bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich.

They stated that breakfast would not be served until 11am...OK, fine, it's New Year's Day. We asked if we could pickup shortly thereafter. They said yes.  Now to the awful food and my theory as to what the restaurant did to complete our order. Clearly someone pissed off about working on New Year's Day or simply angry with their rotten life went to McDonald's and ordered eggs and bacon and threw it in a to go box.  The description on the menu for Bacon Egg Cheese sandwich reads Wisconsin Bacon, Organic Eggs, and Wisconsin White Cheddar.  1. Bacon was limp and greasy unlike the crisp, thick cut of bacon I had on previous visits 2. Eggs were rubbery, tasteless, and in the form of a microwavable egg patty served at a variety of fast food joints (like the one about a block north with the Big Golden Arches, hint, hint...) unlike the homemade scrambled eggs mixed with cheese and piled high on my sandwich once before. 3. Diced potatos came from Local Root, but cleary lacked the seasoning and finely chopped onion with which they used to be served. 4. Ciabatta bread was also good and most likely came from the restaurant. Description on Bacon Egg Cheese breakfast platter reads Wisconsin Bacon, Eggs, and Veg scrambled with white cheddar. It was none of those things. Again, yellow, rubbery, tasteless eggs with greasy flaccid bacon and plain potatos.

Only 1 or 2 other tables in the whole place were occupied. I ordered a glass of wine, which they were out of, but asked if I wouldn't mind a different wine, a more expensive one, for the same price. Sounds good to me. Then we ordered the beet salad with goat cheese. Amazing and/but simple. We each ordered the vegetable flatbread. Amazing fresh veggies and really delicious crust. They really did a great job with this.  Our 10 month old daughter was with us at the table so every employee, from the hostess to the sous chef, came over to our table to meet her and even prepared a special fruit plate for her, gratis.

2012-12-28,4.0,"Local Root is a real solid spot in the Streeterville neighborhood that is seriously lacking variety and local/organic options.  A smaller menu with items like Poutine that are only served after 5pm (haven't tried it yet) but the breakfast and lunch items are pretty good.  I think the breakfast sandwiches could have a bit more seasoning but it's freshly prepared and pretty tasty, all on a freshly baked ciabatta roll.  It's nice to see that LR now gives you the option of the frites with your breakfast sandwich, rather than stuffing them in your bag and forcing you to eat these delicious things.  They lowered the price of just the sandwich accordingly. Prices are a bit high but to be expected for eating local and organic and for the neighborhood. I still think $15 for a duck confit sandwich and side is too much, but it is what it is. I've yet to do dinner here or drinks at the bar but it's such a nice option for the neighborhood.  I finally have a spot close to work that I can eat a sit-down lunch or dinner or even get happy hour drinks. I'm tired of the same chain spots and Tommy O'Tooles. I'm also happy to see that they serve some of the best coffee, Chicago's own Intelligentsia.  The uncooked pasta as coffee mixers is a nice and unique environmentally friendly alternative to plastic or wood stirrers.

Fries are great, locally made ketsup is a nice alternative to Heinz and LR has the best damn chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. PERIOD.

I was hesitant because I would not think to mix jam and hummus on a sandwich, especially with portobellos, but I'm usually up for trying any flavor combination if the chef recommends it.  Big mistake. It should have been named the strawberry jam sandwich. The jam was so copious and overwhelming that I couldn't taste anything else on the sandwich. The portobellos were not just cold, but so cold they hurt my teeth (and I don't have sensitive teeth). I actually set the sandwich down because I couldn't eat it. Then I realized that I wouldn't have time to go elsewhere so I removed the top portion of the baguette with the jam on it and ate the bottom portion with the portobello and hummus as an open-faced sandwich. It still wasn't good, but it helped. There was only hummus on one quarter of the sandwich-- half of the bottom half. It's too bad, because had this sandwich just be hummus and a baguette it would have been good. But for $12, that would be one expensive round of bread and hummus.  My significant other ordered the turkey sandwich, which he said was okay, but again, for $12 a sandwich should at least be good, if not great.

We started with the bacon and caramel poutine.  Great combo!  It was more like dessert than a starter, which is perfectly fine with me!  I had the duck confit brioche with was chock-full of duck and topped with gruyere and this really tasty roasted aioli.  If you're not a fan of duck, this isn't for you, it's really duck-y.  I enjoyed it though.  Only suggestion is to add some flavor to the duck while cooking.  The toppings were great, but the duck itself was pretty plain.  My friend had the brisket brioche and enjoyed it.  I thought it was on the dry side, but he had no complaints.   Sadly, I did not try the drinks, but they had a good list of craft spirit cocktails, craft beer and some wines I had never heard of.  I'll booze it up next time! Service was good overall, but they were over-aggressive when trying to take away my plate.  I was mid-fork jab of the last fry and they asked if they could take the plate away.  Umm, no, MY FORK IS LITERALLY TOUCHING THE PLATE!  I'll be damned if they rob me of the laste tasty fry!  Otherwise, friendly and efficient.  TIP: If you start with the poutine, see if they have a salad instead of fries with the sandwiches.  It's kind of french fry overload.",0.9669,0.739,0.166,0.095,0.5101410934744267

2012-10-22,2.0,"Completely underwhelmed. I live only a few blocks away, and being a Canadian native, couldn't have been more excited when I walked past every day and saw that they planned to have poutine on their menu. The problem is, everything I've had there can be described as bland and average, but also way overpriced.  I've been twice, and both times with a group, so I sampled a lot of what they have to offer.  But when you don't do anything exceptionally well, then you just do everything so-so.   It's too bad, it's a great concept, but I don't ever see myself going back, short of my mom coming to visit & getting her a poutine (but take a tip, Local Root: Poutine is the way Canadians serve french fries AS A SIDE DISH.  Nobody eats them with all the crap you pile on them.  Make one, traditional poutine, and do it well; don't have a bunch of ""eclectic"" (LR's hostess's words) combinations.  And $10 for the cheapest poutine?  Get real - it's a side dish at a sidewalk cafe).  The thing is, as a guy that lives two blocks away & walks past this every day, I'm the guy they want to be a repeat visitor.  Just isn't going to happen. Bottom line:  Average food, way above average prices.  Not a good mix Quick edit:  The gazpacho was fantastic, and I would get that again as a quick & easy carryout, though it's more of a warm weather dish.  I sampled the chili once too, it was kind of tasty but really, really heavy.",0.9565,0.835,0.114,0.051,0.5088541666666667

2012-10-08,5.0,"I heard about Local Root from a friend and decided to give it a try.  I was blown away from start to finish by the entire dining experience. I'm a huge foodie and this place had so many menu items I wanted to try I couldn't possibly get everything I wanted during the first trip.  I settled on a few varied items and shared them with my family.  First came the lamb sausage flat bread pizza.  It was so delicious, I think the 5 of us inhaled it within 2 minutes. Even my sister who said she doesn't like lamb found it delicious.  Next came the beef brisket sandwich and the shredded chicken sandwich.  Both were delicious but I can say this has got to be the top 1 or 2 places for brisket in chicago.  You can totally tell the time and energy to put into it!    We also had the bhaacluckduck and even thought I don't usually like duck, I must say that this dish hit the spot.  For beverages, Ronny the Bartender came over and helped each of us select something. I had a fairly sweet red wine that went perfectly with the brisket.  I also tried the all natural root beer and it was refreshing.  For dessert we had the most amazing chocolate chip cookies I have ever had.  You cannot leave this place without trying their cookies.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!! Lastly, the atmosphere was trendy with upbeat music playing.  It was a lively place to hang out, and I will definitely come back not only for dinner but even just for happy hour.   A review wouldn't be completely without commenting on the philosophy of this joint.  I was very impressed with the whole concept of all organic and locally grown ingredients  and zero waste.  Even the wood is 100% recycled.   They place a lot of emphasis on being environmentally sound and I think more establishments need to do this.  Responding to some earlier comments, I think the prices are what's expected for this type of restaurant. I for one would much rather pay a few extra dollars for high quality and fresh ingredients.   I have a feeling this place is going to be really popular and I feel fortunate to be one of the first people to find this hidden gem.",0.9951,0.793,0.172,0.036,0.5167999999999998

We must eat sustainably, live with the Earth, and embrace the seasons."" The staff went out of their way to be friendly from the second I walked in. They have almond milk (!!) so I ordered a latte and sat down. Louis came over to bring me some water, request any feedback, and overall make the experience very personable. After a while, I ordered a brisket sandwich complete with their still warm, homemade bread and a side salad with fries. Even the ketchup lacked any form of corn syrup or anything hydrogenated or fake. A friend met up and when we asked for another plate, they brought it to us right away, and warm. I do love the little things.  Because of the junk I figure I escaped with no fake stuff, I indulged in the BEST chocolate chip cookie I've had in a while...and left completely fulfilled.

So when Local Root finally opened its doors, I was eager to ""plant myself."" I did not dine in but rather carried out my first order - living around the corner I'm hoping this place becomes a go-to spot for quick bites. ""Becomes"" being the operative word, because there were a few issues with my meal that I'll address here so they can hopefully iron some things out. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fries and a bottled iced tea, which came out to like $496. I'm kidding (clearly), but it was like $17 or $18, which I thought was more than a little steep for how heavy (light?) the bag of food was. I don't want to be the guy on Yelp who complains about expensive food being expensive - I know organic costs more and the rent in Streeterville ain't exactly cheap - but I still remember holding that bag and thinking ""this $18 meal feels a lot like an $8 meal, so it better be freaking INCREDIBLE."" Sadly, it wasn't.  I walked home (literally like 3 minutes) and when I took my first bite of my pig sammy, I noticed three things: the sandwich was not very big, the pork was cold (not ""lost its heat during the 5-minute commute"" but actually ""cold""), and there was about one medicine-dropper's worth of bbq sauce on it. If this was intentional and I just lack the sophisticated palate to appreciate a cold pork sandwich with a hiccup of bbq sauce, then feel free to smack me down. The bun was tasty and thick, and the pork and sauce had a nice flavor. It just lacked temperature. And prominence. And sauce. The fries were good - at first - probably because they tasted as if they had been individually injected with 100 CCs of grease. Seriously, what was initially flavor-tastic soon became too rich and greasy to finish. I'm pretty sure if I squeezed the fries I could have generated enough oil to heat a small country for the winter.  So I'm not gonna give up yet on you Local Root. You're way too close, especially as the cold-weather rolls in and saps my desire to travel far & wide for grub, and I really like what you're trying to do here. As a diner, I just wish I got a little more bang for my buck - or if I know I'm gonna shell out $20 for a sandwich/fries/drink, I want to know that it's a near-orgasmic experience.

Their offering is a bit confusing as they serve food but not a lot of variety; have a bar but again not a lot of variety; and have an espresso bar when starbucks is right next door. I appreciate that the theme is meant to be locally sourced organic food however these supposedly high quality ingrediants are wasted in the way the food is prepared and presented. I had the bacon and scrambled egg sandwich which if i am honest would have been better at other local establishments. Organic food is wasted if it is not prepared and presented in the right way.

2012-09-16,3.0,"Before I get started, I want to add that I will probably change my rating after visiting this place a few more times.  It just opened, so I figure the place is still figuring stuff out. The space is nice.  It has a nice, open layout.  They have a bar in the back, which was a nice surprise.  The staff seemed really nice.  I do think they should have the staff write down orders instead of memorize them, because our order was slightly messed up.  Also, I saw another table have issues with their orders being taken too. The menu had lots of tasty options, but I noticed that there is no cohesion between all their menus.  Some have different pricing (or none at all), others have different menu descriptions. My wife and I had the gazpacho and Montreal poutine.  The gazpacho was excellent.  It was served with bread, which was good, just a little hard.  It would be nice if they served warm bread with the soup. The poutine wasn't bad, but it needs a bit of tweaking.  First off, they really shouldn't charge so much for it.  I feel like it shouldn't cost more than $7, because it is a cheap comfort food to make.  Also, I wish the cheese on the poutine was a little softer (but not melted).  It was basically hard clumps of cheese on the fries.  The gravy was excellent though, as were the fries, which were perfectly crisp.  They should consider serving the dish in more of a bowl than a a plate to be more authentic.  Oh, I should add that the poutine should be served throughout the day.  They only serve it in the evening. In conclusion, I really hope this place does well.  It has so much potential.  The staff seems motivated.  The manager (or maybe owner?)  even came to our table to ask how our meal was.  It is exciting to have such a unique place in our neighborhood, which doesn't have many great food options for being such a densely populated area.  As I pointed out earlier, I think this place does charge a bit much for what they serve.  I definitely plan to check the place out again.  They will get better.",0.9961,0.794,0.178,0.028,0.5853535353535352
2012-09-15,5.0,"Quick read? - Atmosphere is open, making it a great place for a casual meal - Staff is friendly, and the kitchen is open to see - Breakfast is great, good portions + value, good Intelligentsia coffee - Lamb sausage is tasty and well-balanced with other ingredients - Frites are excellent (I can't wait to try the poutine) Local Root opened just this past week, and we stopped by this morning to pick up some breakfast and some coffee. The space is excellent, with nice high ceilings, an open kitchen (through which we saw them baking more biscuits and baguettes for the day), and nice big windows. My girlfriend and I both got variations of their lamb sausage with goat cheese breakfast. It came out in a reasonable amount of time, with pleasant, attentive service. The sausage came cooked together with eggs and zucchini, and the taste was perfectly balanced. With most ordinary breakfasts, the egg can drown out the rest of the ingredients, leaving you with the sensation of eating plain scrambled eggs. This is definitely not the case with Local Root, with the lamb sausage coming through subtly together with the lightness of the zucchini. The breakfast also came with excellent fries (frites), cooked to a perfect crisp and seasoned with kosher salt. I ordered the plate, which came with a biscuit and some excellent tart cherry jam. My girlfriend ordered the sandwich, which was almost the same idea, only with the egg/sausage/zucchini plated onto the biscuit. (One note, the biscuit is more of a ciabatta roll, which is much healthier and offers a cleaner taste than your traditional biscuit).  The portion was plenty for a good breakfast, and together with coffee came to less than $20 for the two of us. They serve good Intelligentsia coffee, although it is not single-cup brewed. I was impressed with the flavor they were able to coax out of a normal drip brew, although I failed to notice that they do have a french press option. That being said, I have no complaints about the freshness of the coffee (and considering the only alternatives are Metropolis at Yolk (brewed the same way) and Starbucks, Local Root is filling a long-standing hole in the Streeterville area). Ultimately, a great start for Local Root. I'm hoping they keep up the quality and the service, and will be heading back soon!",0.9963,0.788,0.18,0.032,0.5265580618212197

Beef Brisket: well seasoned  and extremely tender braised brisket. However, the extremely richness of the brioche bun without much acidity in the sandwich made each bite too rich. Perhaps worth replacing the slaw with something more acidic e.g. some sort of pickles? Or change the bun.  Fries: terrible. I HATE soggy fries. Perhaps the 5-star posters had different experiences but my friend and I at noon received a pile of wobbly, greasy fries. The complete lack of crunch and the oil oozing out of the fry was not impressive for a menu item that they seem to want to take pride in.  Seasoning was fine but they seriously need to work on their frying technique. What a waste of good potatos. Having not tried everything, I'll give this place a second shot.

2012-09-14,4.0,"Anyone who works or lives in Streeterville can probably agree that the lunch options are more than a little lacking.   Enter: Local Root.  Sigh no more, friends.   Went there earlier this week, had the duck confit on brioche.  Beautiful, tender, flavorful..  but the price tag made me cringe (14.49 + tax for an average sized sandwich with a half side salad, around $17 with a small tip).  Still, worth the splurge as I am a big fan of organic foods in general, and ducks in particular.  The brioche was also the tastiest bread I've eaten in recent memory. I just polished off an amazing prosciutto baguette with pickled onions and chevre ($12.49).  And they were giving away free fries today.  Holla.  I don't even usually care for fries, so the fact that I snarfed them down in a matter of minutes and literally did the 'tip the bag into your mouth to catch the crumbs' routine should tell you something.  Also, if cuteness and eco-friendliness sell you, the fries come packaged in a cute little newspaper packet and they seem to be all about sustainability.  Schwing.   Prices may continue to elicit a wince from me, but there's not going to be much of a contest for lunch any longer.  Can't wait to check out their cocktail hour/dinner menu, but if it's as tasty as I'm expecting there's a good chance I may swoon.. and/or propose to one of the chefs or bartenders.",0.9876,0.819,0.161,0.02,0.4449494949494948
2012-09-13,5.0,"Great food!!! I had the bacon & caramel poutines and champagne chicken brioche, it was awesome. Like the other reviewer said, best fries I ever had. There local, sugar cane soda is also amazing. They were out of some of the menu items when I went but I'll assume it was because they just opened. The ambiance is also wonderful but their waiters can use a little training.  I have to try them for breakfast still because my friend went this morning and said the latte was delicious as was the croissant. They must've lowered their prices (another review said it was expensive) because she said it was reasonable for organic, fresh baked food.",0.9833,0.744,0.243,0.013,0.6596153846153847
2012-09-13,5.0,"Great concept- locally sourced organic fast food!  I had the roasted vegetable Brioche, a hot sandwich. I opted for the fries rather then a salad. The fries were great, fresh , light and hand cut. Not the soggy skin on pub style served at so many other places. The sandwich was excellent, the roll fresh out of the oven, a true brioche (Sweet yeast roll). Well I was in the area the very next day so I stopped in again. This is a place were you pay for your meal then bring a number back to your table. The chef himself brought out my plate. Smiling he delivered in less time then you might wait at  McDonalds. This time I had the duck confit brioche. I can't say which was better, the veg or duck. I did go for the fries again. When I come back I am having the champagne chicken- with salad! This place has not had there grand opening yet. If this is practice week I can't wait until they are full on. I don't take time to write many reviews, but I do when I come across 5 STARS!",0.9279,0.839,0.128,0.033,0.5178030303030303
2012-09-12,2.0,"I ordered a salad right at 11 am (the Julius- a caesar), and the lettuce was already browning and hardened from where it had been cut (apparently last night).  The croutons were entirely too large, particularly when being eaten with those recycled material utensils (which I love usually, but not for trying to eat the massive crusty croutons!).  The dressing was pretty much just mayonnaise- certainly no anchovies or anything to add that flavor, so I don't really think it should be called a caesar.  The tomatoes were not crispy- a little limp and some wrinkled.  And the salad came un-tossed, so I had to pick at some gloppy pieces of lettuce and eat other day-old lettuce completely dry.  Oh, and I got to pay $10 for the pleasure, and no, the salad was not massive by any means.   On a positive note, the people were friendly, the pastry samples were tasty, and the pickled onions added a nice kick.",0.9735,0.789,0.161,0.05,0.5415584415584415
2012-09-11,2.0,"Well, I  have been waiting for this place to open and when I went in excited to order food, there were no prices.   No prices on the chalk boards and no menus printed with prices.  With trepidation, I ordered a small cafe con leche and croissant to be safe.  When they rang me up, the total was: $6.68.  $3.49 was for the small croissant and 2.49 for the small cafe con leche.  Can you say shocking!   I was so hoping we would have a cool local inspired eatery with reasonable prices.  Sadly, it was for not.  Hopefully, since they are still in their debut month , they will amend their prices to meet the needs of all of the neighborhood and not just the ultra wealthy that can spend over $6 for coffee and danish.",0.6627,0.776,0.127,0.097,0.6115384615384615
2012-09-11,3.0,"Like the first poster, I was eagerly awaiting the opening of this place and today, on 9/11, they opened their doors to the public. My fiance and I were walking by yesterday and Ronnie the bar tender talked us into coming today to check it out. I'll start with the bad, since most of these things are FIXABLE and I am hoping that it was only because it was day one that these things happened.  1. We arrived close to 8 pm and were told they were out of mussels, anything with ""brisket"" and ""caprese"", which was pretty much half the menu. 2. We were seated outdoors (yeah for outdoor seating) but quickly noticed we were right under the kitchen vent, actually the entire south section of the outdoor seating is under the vent. It wasn't bad until a big puff of smoke from the kitchen came out covering us in a smoke screen. We moved but really that entire section should be avoided. 3. The flat bread takes 30 minutes to cook. We were told this once we ordered it so it would have been nice to know prior. My fiance pointed out too that since it is kind of misleading since it is the first thing on the menu, like it was an appetizer. 4. A food server came out and went to three different tables before he got the correct table. 5. We were brought our food and no silverware was given to us. The food runner said he would be right back with plates and silverware and we never saw him again. After like 5 or 7 minutes we flagged our server down and asked her for silver which took her a minute or two to get as well. Seriously we could have went to 7-11 across the street and got some plastic ware faster. 6. I thought the flat bread could have been cooked a little longer. The dough was soft and I prefer it crispy, is that just a personal preference? 7. There were a lot of frites with my dish. A lot. Even the flat bread was a lot of food. Now the good. 1. The Streeterville Old Fashion was awesome. Ronnie the bar tender is great. I went in and talked to him for 10 minutes and you can tell he really takes his job to heart. 2. The food was really friggin good taste wise. The fries were perfect, and I mean perfect. Crispy on the outside and soft and hot in the middle. I mean they really have perfected the fries, really. 3. Everything is local. Even the whiskey and the spelt (yeah, order the spelt, its amazing) are local. This gives you a good feeling that you are supporting local right? Yes I've listed more bad than good, but most of the bad can be fixed! I'll probably wait a little while before heading back, well I'll go back and visit Ronnie for some drinks prior to eating there again. But the great thing is that the employees of this place really want to make this place work. The chef came out to talk to us and ask how things were, which is great. Check this place out, if not just for coffee. I am hoping that I can update this to 4 stars eventually, but until then, 3 will do!",0.9969,0.802,0.153,0.045,0.441608309990663
