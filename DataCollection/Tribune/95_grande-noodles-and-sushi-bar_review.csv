The signature Grande or King Kong rolls are my fave. Generally, you should always get the signature rolls when you go to a new sushi place, it's what helps separate one sushi joint from the other.

One spoonful was too many, returned it immediately.  Crab Rangoon was decent, but it's hard to mess up something frozen that gets thrown into an oven. Appetite was ruined by then.

The menu's large and creative -- my favorite dish is the Rama Noodle Delight, an unusual but addicting combo of curry, peanut sauce, and thick, crispy-fried noodles that soften in the sauce -- the staff are friendly, and the execution is incredibly consistent (which I find is what ultimately knocks a lot of could-be-great local spots off my list of go-tos). The produce looks and tastes super-fresh; it's both abundant and well cooked, whereas many similar places apparently just don't know how to handle a carrot. Portions will get you through 1.5-2 meals. Considering that the food's this good, the service is bafflingly fast. I usually order takeout through GrubHub and am alerted that it's ready not only sooner than the estimated time, but before I've even left the house.

On the up side, they have some good maki, the thai food is excellent and delivery usually is earlier than projected.  I recommend the sweet potato maki.  This is a good place to try and I will order from them, but know what to expect.  As an alternative, try Indie- its a great sushi/thai place up the street and they deliver.",0.7864,0.783,0.118,0.1,0.609507883420927

The sweet potato maki is perfect for people who love sushi rolls but don't like the fish or vegetable part; it's basically a gooey mass of panko crumbs, unagi sauce, cream cheese, rice and tempura sweet potato.  It was a bit rich and not what I look for in a sushi roll, but I see the appeal. The california roll was fresh and tasty.   The tom kha really stole the show for me.  I think I'd even go as far to say that it is the best version I've had outside of Thailand (yes, I'm an asshole.

Some pan-Asian joints struggle with one area of the menu or another, but all of Grande's fare is at least above-average.  Sushi, curries, Thai noodles, stir fries and fried rice:  all the usual suspects are represented skillfully. I usually stick with the sushi and either pad thai or spicy basil, but tonight I decided to branch out.  I ordered the Grande Noodles, an interesting dish with egg noodles, crab meat, barbecue pork, sprouts, and peanuts.  All those disparate ingredients did not quite add up to more-than-the-sum-of-its-parts deliciousness, but it was still pretty good.  I also ordered one of the two spicy shrimp soups, the one with tomatoes, mushrooms, and lemongrass.  Yum--B+.  The steamed shrimp shumai was fairly average, but the delicious dipping sauce brings it up to a B.   My friend liked the crab rangoon, which I do not typically eat but agreed to try.  For a crab-rangoon-hater, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was sufficiently crab-y and not too cream-cheesy.  I also tried her tofu fried rice, and it was excellent--a solid A.  It had a kind of grilled flavor to it rather than the usual fried-rice grease taste. As I said, the prices are very good and portions are generous.  I live in the area, so I sometimes get coupons in the Valpak mailings.  Typical deals are ""Buy one entree, get second 1/2 off"" or ""$5 off an order over $30.""  Tonight I did not have a coupon and the bill for one soup, two appetizers, one maki, two entrees, and tax was just $30.10.  You can't beat that.  Plus, it's BYOB.

2008-08-06,4.0,"I'm always pleased by this place, whether dining, carrying out or ordering delivery.  With the latter, it once literally took them 10-12 minutes after I placed the order before they were buzzing my doorbell.  Granted, I live little more than a block away, but still...That's some serious service! The service when dining in is similarly attentive without being intrusive.  And how can you not love the framed photo of the Dalai Lama that hangs on the wall behind the cash register?!?  The flowing robes, the grace, bald...striking. ;) As for the food, it is excellent.  I could do without the shredded cabbage (instead of rice, the norm at most places) that forms the foundation for my favorite dish, rama Thai with chicken.  But the maki is excellent, second only to Bentonara in my experience.  And the appetizers are inexpensive, generously portioned and delicious. This is a great place to dine if you ever find yourself hungry and in Rogers Park.",0.9872,0.752,0.206,0.042,0.7140350877192982

2008-07-15,2.0,"I might be a bit stubborn or have too much Japanese pride but I don't particularly like it when a Thai place has split personality disorder and adds a ""Japanese"" menu.  I think some places can pull it off, but this place just rubs me the wrong way with this teriyaki bento box BS.  I just get a bit aggravated when a restaurant sends a message that Japanese food is just sushi and teriyaki.  I know, I know it's trying to get a larger customer base and actually a pretty smart move in the competitive market.  But, I'm gonna be an a-hole and stick with my judgement on this place.  Also, who is the ""genius"" that thought of sticking up forks and spoons as wall decor.  I give the place 3 stars for Thai, but 1 for Jap.",-0.7572,0.804,0.078,0.118,0.4862433862433863

2008-04-28,4.0,"I actually had my first sushi experience here, which wasn't good...but in the restaurant's defense, I had NO idea what I was ordering and ordered some variety of sashimi...which totally sicked me out...it was scary, I didn't know what to do with soy sauce...and I had to go eat pizza afterwards. Once the lovely Colleen C had introduced me to maki one fun evening at Bentonara (roughly a year after my first disastrous try), I ventured back to this joint, armed with the knowledge of what I like (and that sashimi was a bit too scary for my very American tastebuds!). They also have an assortment of Thai noodle dishes, which makes this Thai food lover very excited (and eager to continue eating here!) We were surprised at how good the maki was!  There's a good variety of rolls, the fish was fresh, and the rolls well-prepared.  The price is reasonable, the restaurant is BYOB, and it's easily accessible by the #22 Clark bus (if it ever decides to run).",0.9545,0.753,0.177,0.07,0.537719298245614

I got the banana duck (red) curry and he got roasted duck over rice.  His might have been better with more sauce, but next time we will definitely both order the banana duck curry - it was creative and deeeeeelicious!",0.9534,0.777,0.209,0.015,0.5280808080808082

2008-02-13,4.0,"I still have to find a Thai restaurant that serves really good beef salad at a decent price.  With other Thai places, either the beef salad is really good but is a small serving that's over-priced, or the serving is decent but it doesn't taste good.  I ordered carry-out from Grande with hopes that this might be the place, but it wasn't.  The serving was huge, which is rare, but the taste really didn't do it for me.  It tasted kind of sweet, and I don't like sweet for my beef salad.  Although at the time, I devoured it since I was so hungry.  Also, I ordered Basil Chicken and that was very good.  I was a little bit disappointed though because both dishes were not spicy.  On the menu, both dishes had their little spicy symbol, but they were nowhere near spicy.  I guess you have to tell them that you want it spicy. The restaurant is nice, though.  I would visit again, maybe dine in at the restaurant and also try their sushi! *Update* Went here again 3 weeks ago to dine in...bf ordered the seafood tom yum soup and I ordered the grande maki....both were delicious!  The sushi roll was huge and left me stuffed.  I will definitely be returning!  Service was great as well.",0.9932,0.759,0.215,0.026,0.6455333333333334

It's definitely great for take out, but honestly, I like eating in at this place too. It's quiet and you don't feel like you're listening in on your neighbors conversation like you do at the typical pack-as-many-tables-in-as-you-can sushi places.
