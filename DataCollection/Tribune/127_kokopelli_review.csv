The restaurant itself was nicely decorated, everything you would expect in a wicker park taco place, exposed brick, hardwood floors, cool bar with back lights etc...  With our groupon we got 3 guacamoles 12 tacos and 12 cocktails. Score. As soon as we sat down the server informed us three tacos were not available, kraken, steak and pulled pork. We were pretty bummed because on a menu of 8 tacos, three were not available. We made due with the remaining tacos. We ordered a mixture of the 5 that were available. Also ordered their seasonal faux and their chicaharron guac. Also ordered milanesa tortas only to be informed 10 minutes later they too were not available.  Presentation was done nicely. Guacamoles were excellent (highly recommend the chicaharron). Tacos were ok. My favorite of the bunch was the shrimp tacos but the shrimps lacked in quality (think 9.99 bags of frozen shrimp at jewel). Maybe too much time was spent on ambience and presentation, not enough in food. They gave us complementary once cream as a nice gesture for not having much in the menu. It was kind, but I would have traded it for a full menu.  Probably wouldn't come back again. I would much rather go to one of the 500 taco restaurants in the 1/2 mile radius.",0.965,0.888,0.107,0.005,0.5223662551440329

2015-10-21,3.0,I haven't heard of many Mexican places that don't have chips and salsa as a complimentary dish at the table so I was a bit surprised that a Wickerpark mexican restaurant was not offering any chips and salsa to nibble on.   We did order the chips and salsa as a starter and were very disappointed with the amount and quality of the salsa that was served. I was also very disappointed in the ceviche.  It lacked any real unique bite and was very liquidy.   The traditional guacamole was not noteworthy either. What stole the show for me were the kraken and shrimp jicima tacos.  Both packed a flavorful bite and I had the option to do both tacos on a thin slice of jicima rather than tortilla which I absolutely loved.  It left me feeling light and not so stuffed and was a unique and refreshing taste. Overall the service was good and the place was nice...minue a few fruit flies that buzzed around.  I do think that since there are plenty of other spots to try I will wait before I pick coming back.,0.7069,0.888,0.075,0.037,0.5392857142857143

2015-08-25,2.0,"In terms of the food, I was surprised at both the high artistry of the presentation and the fairly bland quality of the meats in these tacos.  Tried the baja, shrimp, steak and La Chota (roasted pork) tacos...I would honestly say that none of the meats were even vaguely interesting.  But, at least on the baja and La Chota tacos, I liked the toppings but they were hiding so much bland fish/pork that I'm not sure what the real intent of the tacos were here.  Pairing great toppings with incredible cores is the backbone of what makes the tacos at Authentaco and Antique Taco so amazing.  At Kokopelli, it's a poor disguise for average steak, for example. My El Abuelo cocktail was good and the chicharron guacamole was tasty.  We had a Groupon so the prices were better...spent $41 all-in for the Groupon plus tip, which saved us about $10.  Good daily specials but I'm not sure those deals lead to the kinds of quality you can get elsewhere.  Service was attentive, and almost overly so; within a ten-minute stretch, three visits to see how things are going is probably too many.  Very glad I came since I live close by but I'm not sure this measures up to the high quality I can find elsewhere in Wicker!",0.9683,0.787,0.145,0.068,0.6745333333333332

I can see this being a place to catch a soccer game if you live in the area. Taco time: I had the jicama shrimp, baja and kraken. He had the pulled pork, steak and kraken. While I liked the concept of jicama as I've heard it's low carb and very healthy, it was pretty tasteless. The baja (their take on a fish taco) was 90% cabbage and again lacking on the spices. It should be renamed cabbage salad. Hubby said the pulled pork was his fav but again nothing to write home about as it was pretty fatty. The kraken was decent and pretty much the winner, but wouldn't really hold a candle to other taco shops in the city.

The size and portion was great, but the tortillas were charred and burnt in some spots.  I could only taste the bitter burnt tortilla.  The fillings of all the tacos however were tasty.  Not like any other tacos I've had before.   Also, I had the Oaxacan Old Fasioned and my girlfriend ordered the Margarita Kokopelli.  Both had very strong pronounced flavors - the Margarita had jalapeno -infused tequila with cucumber.  A refreshing drink on a hot day.  The Oaxacan Old Fashioned was a latin-twist on the classic whiskey drink.  It tasted much smokier than the classic Old Fashioned.

2015-06-15,4.0,"There's much to like about this place.  They have a long list of interesting tacos and small dishes, perfectly suited for those who fear commitment and love to sample and swap.  Their origins are in the Tijuana food scene -- and the more interesting elevated scene (think La Querencia) rather than the al-pastor street-taco scene.  That's all for the good. And yet many of the tacos are not successes -- drippy, droopy, and overfilled.  I suppose it is good that they are taking some chances, but it means that you need to spread risk when you order.  As some of the other reviews have suggested, the kraken, steak, and shrimp tacos are all very good, and shrimp seems especially underrated.  The margaritas are too sweet for my kitchen but passable for a restaurant -- and much enlivened by the thick lick of salt on the glasses.   All in all, this was a worthwhile adventure.  But when I cross over to this side of the 90-94 for dinner there are at least half a dozen superlative options, and Kokopelli doesn't quite rise to that level for me.  Three-and-a-half stars, with the borderline half-star added out of nostalgia for Mexico.",0.9707,0.819,0.148,0.033,0.4926984126984126

The kraken taco is octopus, avocado and some other really tasty stuff , I will say I normally hate octopus.

Speaking of servers , the bar tender/sever was amazzzing. He deserves his own Yelp page. He was sooooo friendly, accommodating and just plain wonderful. He gave recommendations , made coverdation to those who wanted it and was really passionate about the place. I will say he made part of the night what it was ... and most servers aren't that memorable. Finally, the place has an open window/patio so you can eat facing out to the street. YES !!!

2015-04-22,2.0,"Initially, I was very excited to try this new Mexican joint with the funny name. The decor was inviting, and it was very close to home.  A couple friends and I decided to make a reservation and give this restaurant a shot. Long story short, it was disappointing. We went there on Tuesday night to take advantage of their $2 tacos. I love tacos. If tacos were on Tinder, I would definitely right swipe that business. If they ever legalized food marriage, I would be first in line, at the courthouse, with a couple of them in hand.  I couldn't contain my excitement when I saw their extensive taco list. Fish tacos! Shrimp tacos! Octopus tacos! Is there nothing this place can't make into a taco? I wanted to try them all. I wasn't expecting them to be so tiny. All tacos are precious in their own special way, but I wouldn't pay the full $4 price for these. They were small and definitely left something to be desired. The flavor was great, but I wasn't expecting to order four of them to feel  somewhat full.  Not to mention, we also ordered guacamole and the pineapple salsa. My friend compared the salsa to pureed baby food. I couldn't unsee it. From the small, baby food sized jar, to the small, baby food sized spoon, this is what I would expect to buy from Gerber.  Usually, I don't season my food with salt and pepper. It's a huge insult to the chef, and I respect their work. However, this guacamole NEEDED salt and definitely wasn't worth the full $8. Like a bad one night stand, I've definitely had better. They also don't give you very much for the price.  Now, onto the service. Mediocre. I understand the Hawks game was on. I'm a fan too, but it shouldn't take more than 2 minutes to get my can of Tecate. Also, when you give me a new can, please take the empty one away.

Used a groupon for two cocktails, guacamole, and four tacos with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  My cocktail, the TJ sour, was great- refreshing and strong, with just the right amount of kick. The guac was fresh and flavorful. For my tacos, I went with the grilled and breaded fish ones. I definitely preferred the breaded fish one, but both were really good. The proteins are garnished with unique and well-paired flavors. There was also a perfect filling to tortilla ratio- small tortillas packed with meat and toppings, so you're not left with a handful of tortilla after eating the filling first. The tacos come in threes, which would have been an ideal portion, if we didn't have the guac first. They have a long list of tacos, and I would definitely come back to try to the other ones and enjoy more of their cocktails!",0.9895,0.787,0.213,0.0,0.5100274725274726

I have often wondered what it was, but never enough to simply walk across the street.  The fates truly brought us together. I was walking down the street determined to spend no more money when their advertised sangria special made me weak. A girl just can't resist a good week night special, so I walked in made myself cozy at the bar and quickly feel in love. The place is more spacious than you may guess. The bar is backed by exposed brick where various liquor bottles rest on well lit shelves. There are two muted TV and a few tap handles as well.  The bar tender mixed me up a glass of white sangria and it was love at first sip. The sangria is a great blend of sweet and dry flavors with enough fruit to give you a tropical feeling of escape. I have been back numerous Mondays for the $15 sangria pitchers. While sipping on sangria I have branched out to try the some of the chips and salsa and stolen a few bites of others' dishes. Everything i have sampled is delicious. While I maintain firm in my love of shitty bar food, I have to admit this place has some tasty bites.

2015-01-26,2.0,"My party of 3 arrived at 6:30 on a Sunday evening to find the place surprisingly empty, but it did pick up a little over the next hour and a half we were there. First, I will cover service: The hostess greeted us and allowed us to sit wherever we wanted. She also turned out to be our waitress. We only noticed her and one busboy as front of house staff at that time. As a waitress, to say the least, she was extremely underwhelming. She was unhelpful and didn't seem remotely exciting explaining the menu to us, even after I said ""Can you explain the menu? It's our first time here!"" She didn't mention the mini tortas or bocadillos sections on the menu. As the evening progressed, a bartender appeared and another server came out (from the back? I guess?). This group of 4 seemed to all do everything (???) -- We saw the bartender helping a table with their bill, the busboy seated multiple tables...it was all very odd. The most important thing: on top of not having any enthusiasm, the staff seemed as if they had never received ANY TRAINING. I will get to this with our food and drinks: We ordered the pepino picante, which was extremely sweet and not spicy as our waitress suggested (disappointing, chile infused tequila sounded like a nice twist on what would otherwise just be a cucumber margarita, and that it was), the smokey guey (was expecting a nice smokey cocktail, received a drink that slightly tasted of mezcal...with a ton of lime juice and simply syrup), and the el abuelo (was looking for something fruity and sweeter, was recommended this. It was extremely strong and tasted similar to an old fashioned). Overall, didn't love the drinks. Next up, food: The salsas -- We did a trio. The castigo azteca we decided was the best thing we had at the restaurant. The lagrimas de lucifer really is insanely spicy. Chicharron Guacamole -- Expensive considering how small the portion was, but tasted good. Tacos: Kraken -- Good. That's it. A special of ""pork confit with a tamarind glaze"" -- Pork was extremely dry and rough. No tamarind taste and was paired with a very, very sweet cabbage slaw.  Rasta -- This was good but desperately needed lime -- we couldn't understand why they didn't put more lime with their tacos when they were ALL craving a fresh squeeze. Table also agreed that we had no idea what they did with their ""pickled"" onions to result in them having no flavor. Literally. At all. Steak a las Brasas - This was the favorite. But, again, back to service: we asked our waitress what exactly the taco had in it. She stood there speechless and looking embarrassed (seriously), and then awkwardly stumbled over her words, grabbed a menu from our table, and just stammered, reading to us what the menu said. We could have read it for ourselves, we actually had already done that, but we wanted to know what the additional ingredients were, specifically the crunchy ingredient on the top of the taco. Guess it'll remain a mystery. Couple other notes: 1-The outer door slammed SO LOUD every single time someone came in or out of the restaurant, the front half of the restaurant would turn to look at the door. 2-On the top of the ""tacos"" section on the menu it said ""All tacos served with home made corn tortillas, monterrey jack cheese and avocado"" -- We found this not to be true, though we were relieved when our octopus tacos didn't have cheese ;) Unless there is a drastic change with the service, we will not return. Is it so bad that I wanted the staff to be enthusiastic about this cool new place and recommend great items, describing them until my mouth is watering? Or, at the very least, know the menu?

The beans and cheese melted perfectly together and the hand-tossed corn masa was cooked perfectly.  I ordered (3) Tacos- I am a taco girl and I was disappointed in the quality of the food. Also, the tacos were small.  Kraken Grilled octopus marinated in a mexican pesto, pickled onions, castigo azteca salsa -I was so excited to taste the octopus, but now regret it.

They must have changed the option of not having to order the same kind of taco, as previous Yelper mentioned. I was delighted that we got to choose any 3 tacos. Had the funky veggie, steak, and kraken tacos. I was most excited to try the kraken, as I like octopus, and while not bad, just didn't feel the flavors went that great together. The veggie and steak were pretty good, but all the tacos kinda tasted the same and had the same flavors. Couldn't really differentiate them besides the protein. Also, as others mentioned, the tacos are on the smaller side but are packed with ingredients, so it is pretty filling. Service was good. Staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, food was good but not that memorable.",0.9945,0.688,0.284,0.028,0.564247311827957
2015-01-11,5.0,This is my second time coming here in a month. The guac is a must have as well the fish tacos. I love the creative drinks too. There are lots of places around Chicago to have tacos but if you want good tacos then go to this place. The music and ambience is very welcoming and intimate.  In the middle of dinner the lights dimmed and the music was fitting. The wait staff was nice and helpful in suggesting menu items.

2015-01-10,1.0,"Tonight, some friends and I (group of 5) came to kokopelli, and the experience was terrible to say the least. What led us to this Mexican restaurant was the hype, we knew we had to experience it for ourselves, since we had heard such great things. First, we called to make a reservation and were shut down.  We arrived at the restaurant at about 8pm and, we were told that the wait would be about 45 minutes, or when a bigger table opened up which, was expected. Bottom line is we waited for over an hour, and within that time frame they sat groups of 2-6 people. When we asked the hostess why this was happening she blatantly lied to our faces and said they ""had appointments"" (but we knew some did not).  At one point, they were getting ready to sit us and then they said it was a confusion and began to separate the table they had set up for us, so smaller groups could use it instead. WE LEFT! and without an explanation or an apology.... We ended up at Antique Taco where we were treated the right way. Needless to say, koko's supposed to text you when your table is ready...they never did.",0.4753,0.917,0.046,0.037,0.48052910052910053

Wanting to try what essentially set them apart from most taco joints, we went straight for the seafood tacos. I didn't enjoy the octopus. It felt really chewy, but the Baja taco was amazing.

2015-01-06,2.0,"I have to admit, my expectations were high for this place.  I won't belabor this: - There are several spots on Milwaukee Avenue to get  s t e l l a r !!!  $3+ per taco tacos.  This is not one of them. They are just tacos.  Given their pedigree, they should be stellar tacos, but they are..... just tacos. Nothing to see here, keep moving.  - Drinks are good, but a house margarita will set you back $10.  It will ease the pain of the average taco, but only until you notice that you are paying $10 for a margarita.  - Seating is oddly situated and tight.  The tables to the left and right of us were so close that it felt as if we were all in the same party, listening to each others conversations... just, well, a bit too close.   Its a pretty spot, a Milwaukee Avenue worthy joint.  Tacos are a serious business on this street, though, and Kokopelli is not even part of the competition.",0.9573,0.828,0.137,0.034,0.44353968253968257

2014-12-07,4.0,"Tasty! We brought some heavy taco hitters with us and I was nervous as to how they would like it. My credibility was on the line too. Well, it was successful. Everyone enjoyed their tacos. The guac and salsa flights were great. Presented nicely and all very tasty. Many different flavors and something to satisfy everyone. In terms of the tacos, they were all very good. One down fall is that you cannot mix and match. 3 per order of the same one. Considering that, we all ordered a different one and shared. Many different fish items which was cool and really creative design/use of the jicama. Two things that brought the rating down for me: 1. Every taco had a slice of avocado. It was a little bit of an overkill. I love avocado but there just seemed like a lack of creativity on that end (""just toss an avocado slice on it!"") and 2. We were asked about drinks and water refilled every few minutes. Sounds weird to complain about but again - a little bit of an overkill. There are other subtle measures to take besides asking how we are and filling water; For example, bringing new plates after the appetizer, wiping crumbs, bringing more chips when a noticeable amount of guacamole is still present, etc. Overall, we had a nice time and enjoyed everything we ate. The atmosphere and location are great. It's also a good place for a date yet still being able to rage tacos. Everything was priced fairly. We will be back.",0.9826,0.78,0.169,0.051,0.5496378066378067

2014-11-26,3.0,"I liked how the menu was organized. There are a wide selections of salsas, gaucamoles, and ceviches you can try. You can order one, two, or three selections. We tried the beets and habanero salsa, which was extreemely spicy. I underestimated how spicy it would be. It was sweet and good, but I could only eat the mimimal amount. I tried the black harder ceviche and the pulpo, both of which was great to eat after a very spicy salsa. If you order more than one ceviche, the portion sizes do not decrease, so it's only an additional $4 for the second, and an extra $3 for the third. Although I know it would take difficult for the kitchen, I wish you could order tacos of three different flavors instead of the same one. We decided to go with the rainbow trout mini tortas instead. It was shredded fish instead of a filet, but still very good. Overall, I was happy with our food and the menu selection. I feel that service would be improved. I think it was almost too attentive. Our waitress asked us how we were doing too many times and multiple people came by our table to check on us. I know the business is new and I'm sure they just want all their new customers to be happy, but I think it could be toned down a bit.",0.987,0.829,0.152,0.019,0.5187572150072151

The best recommendation was that the diablo salsa really is that hot, and not worth ordering in and of itself.  She was nice enough to give us a small free portion of it, and it was ridiculously hot. The other salsa we tried (with pumpkin seed) was great.  We had a couple of guacs that were solid, but nothing out of the ordinary, and we really liked the tacos we ordered (the kraken being the best).  The booze selection was good as well, with a ton of cocktails, tequillas, and beer.
