2016-07-09,3.0,"The food is pretty good for standard bar fare, and they have bottomless mimosas for brunch! The main issue I have is they never seem to be staffed appropriately. Often, the bartender is the only employee and if s/he is downstairs restocking, it feels a little deserted coming in as a patron. When I went last, there was no waitstaff so people seated outside were waiting to place their order before realizing they had to come in to order at the bar. Just not a great customer experience. This is totally not a staff issue as the service is always friendly, it's a problem with how staff are scheduled.  Anyway, now that this is off my chest, they have a good burger and even better soup! Generous portion of blue cheese on the burger is my favorite way to order it! The cheese fries are also delicious. And seriously, I want to reiterate, the soup.

Because I'm allergic to cinnamon, I asked if I could take another whiskey for three dollars.  Zach, the manager denied my request. I understand the difference between Jamison for six dollars and fireball for three but when we are your only customers you might want to try and keep us here like Cory would have done.

2014-11-29,4.0,"The content of this review is mostly irrelevant for the purposes of Yelp users - my apolgies. For your curious readers/drinkers/eaters, the Division Street Ale is good. The food portions are generous, the beer list is decent, and patio is sprawling. If you find yourself in the area, stop in... It probably wont be your favorite bar in the city, but it does the job.  It was about 5 pm on a Wednesday in July when my friend (Basil) and I stopped into DAH for just this purpose - put back a few beers, grab a quick bite on the patio. Basil, was going through a 'personal thing' and wasn't drinking for the month of July... just apps and diet coke for her.  We met on the patio, shared pleasantries and began to review the menu. My selection included Lagunites and Irish nachos, Basil's included chatting with the waitress. At first, the usual: ""what's good here"" and ""does that have mustard on it"".... Then she noticed the hot wings.... Like the ghost-pepper-burn-your-fingers-off-dont-sue-us-for-the-pain hot wings. ""Fantastic, I'll have that.""  Our waitress was very taken aback and followed with the disclosure that very few people are able to eat 10 of those wings, and no woman has ever finished the task. For me, this was a red flag; for Basil, this was a green light. Order confired, and the concerned waitress went to the kitchen to share the news ""we have a girl out there, ready to take on the wing challange."" I can only imagine the response as anxious laughter.  And the process began.  First came the waiver. About 300 words on why you're crazy to eat 10 wings in 10 minutes, and you promise not to sue DAH when you digestive system shuts down. Okay, got it.  Next the utensils and safety equippment. A cup with a fork, a pair of rubber gloves, a wet napkin.... everything except the hazmat suit. And finally, the plate of wings. 10 pepper encrusted wings, so hot you could feel it on the other side of the patio. To accompany the wings, the entire kitchen staff came to enjoy the spectacle. And so it began, with a firm word of caution from me: ""you don't need to do this"" ""its probably not worth it"" and ""ok, but please don't make a scene when these wings are hotter than you expected.""  The strategy began with biting into the first wing. This proved less than ideal as the sauce was too hot for skin, and as we know, wings are messy. The new game plan - tear off the chicken into small pieces, minimal chewing. This worked, 2 wings down, 8 to go. Waitress and kitchen staff standing in awe,  frightened for what might soon follow - maybe internal bleeding? Possibly projectile vomiting? Death? ... All reasonably possibilities in our mind.  5 wings down. Basil needed a liquid break. Of course, the rule is you can only drink booze in this challenge, making IPA the only extinguisher available. As it goes, I was tasked with feeding Basil the hoppy liquid while dabbing the tears streaming from her eyes.  8 wings down. The kitchen staff had now exited the patio... The waitress still awaited the results.  9 wings. I am out of my seat, as the one man cheering section to this monumental feat. In between dabbing tears, and pouring beer.  10 wings, 9 minutes. Done. Clean to the bone. The patio erupts into applause.  Our waitress brings out the trophy t shirt, and congratulates Basil on the truly impressive achievement - breaking barriers and records in Chicago, one food challenge at a time.",0.9929,0.828,0.119,0.053,0.5360399072694154

The fish came with tartar sauce and a curry sauce, both were whatever. The tartar sauce for some reason didn't taste right to me and the curry sauce was bland. I ordered the Jameson cake for dessert and it was huge, dense, and pretty average tasting. The waitress tried to sell me this lava cake instead, which she described as ""much smaller"". I'm not really sure what she meant by that. Was she implying that I was fat for ordering the larger Jameson cake? I'm not really sure.

The best thing about our meal was the outdoor seating.  We easily grabbed a table outside and enjoyed the early fall sunshine.  However, everything else after that was kind of subpar.  I ordered a HB Oktoberfest that wasn't very cold.  My burger was more undercooked than the medium rare I wanted it...and the beef was kind of stringy looking.  It wasn't very good.  I ate half of it and brought the rest home.  Ashley ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and, as she put it, it was the worst buffalo chicken wrap she ever ate.  That's like saying it was bad pizza.  Pizza is always tasty, but it wasn't very good.  Make sense?  She really liked her tater tots though.   Our waitress was friendly, but she may have been working about 20 other tables because it took a long time in between stops at our table.  We easily waited 10 minutes for our check, and then another five to get the check back so we could sign and leave. We used a  restaurant.com  gift certificate, so maybe that had something to do with the wait, but we've used them before at Boundary and have never waited that long.  With those gift certificates, you have to spend a certain amount in order to get the discount, so we wanted a little dessert, annnnnnd we were told they didn't have dessert.  Next time we get lunch we will go straight to Boundary, we've always have 5-star experiences there.",0.9686,0.828,0.12,0.053,0.5952871148459382

Whenever I've been out for a run, or walking down division street, I've noticed them advertising that they show UFC here. Since I'm a fan of not buying the PPVs, this seemed like it could be a good alternative to Tap Room by me.  I really like that there is a lot of space here. So much so that I do need to come here on a regular night. It was definitely a nice change of pace as I'm more used to smaller places that are really cramped.  The beer selection is definitely solid. While I do go out of my way to hit up Jerry's and B&L, this hits some of the spots that I would want for. I wasn't here for some uber deep beer selection though and it's not really what I would expect either. I'm more than happy that they had a nice selection of craft brews and even more happy that when I was in the mood for some german bier, I got it in a proper german stein. Much respect for that.  I didn't get a chance to try any of the food as I spent the earlier part of the evening down the street at B&L. The service was very good, especially considering that there were a ton of people here. Everything seemed to work like clockwork and you could tell they were more than used to this.  I'll definitely come back to Division Ale House.

It was insanely busy, so it took a while to get service, which is completely fine. Once the waitress showed up (and all night through) she was great, as good as it gets. Smiley, friendly, answers to questions, getting drinks and food as we needed, leaving us alone when we were making out on the table.  I tried their PB Smash house cocktail, because it was hot and I felt like something tropical and refreshing. As a guy I tend to worry they'll bring these fruity drinks in some girly glass (confidence in your masculinity only goes so far at a bar). But it was your standard chilled beer glass full of liquor and juices. Nice, very nice.  Had a giant basket of fries and curry sauce for like five bucks. Again, pretty stellar.

When we first walked in there were signs everywhere for $5 appetizer specials for the night, but apparently that is no longer a special, even though its listed everywhere, including the bathrooms. Not that big of a deal, but at least take the signs down.  Then I asked for their sweet potato fries or sweet potato tater tots and apparently they are changing the whole menu and don't have those anymore. It would be nice if you updated the actual menu and the print menu at the same time! That was a bummer.  Then they switched waitresses on us in the middle of our service (and not because she was going on break, so I'm not sure why). So because of this, they messed up our request for 3 separate bills, and at the end we had to separate it all on our own. Again, shouldn't be that big of a deal, but we specifically asked. Throughout the night they hardly came to check on us for drinks, drinks were slow to come out, and the bill took forever.

I had heard that Division Ale House was now offering something called a ""suicide"" wing.  Now normally I scoff at this because places will say ""inferno!"", ""suicide!"" or countless other adjectives to describe something that barely has the heat of a jalapeno, which royally pisses me off.  But then I saw that these wings were coated in bhut jolokia (ghost chili) sauce.  NOW my ears perked up...this might be something worth checking out after all! I didnt even know it was a challenge.  All I knew was that it was not on the menu and had to be specially requested.  Our server, sweet thing that she was, had me sign a form while looking at me like ""this girl is about to have her ass whooped and she has no clue!"" The wings came.  They were a decent size, coated in an orangy sauce that oddly did not smell much at all.  She also placed a bell in front of me for ""when I needed milk and bread to be brought over"".  Ha! OK, these things are DELICIOUS.  I was in absolute heaven.  I have an abnormally high tolerance for heat and it is a rare, rare day when I can get enough to satisfy me.  These have a slow burn which doesn't really register until you are about half way done.  But the sauce itself had a great flavour!  Wasn't bitter or tart in any way. Then the sweating starts.  I felt a bit of numbness on the inside of my bottom lip.  Actually, it felt hotter once I had finished all of them and my mouth wasn't moving anymore.  But I was done and was full!

2010-03-05,4.0,"I have respect for this place. Which is ridiculous, because I'm a super Irish snob. My last name is Donaldson, fool. I'm not kidding about my Irish food. But for living in Chicago, a lot of people seem to have forgotten their roots, so Division Ale House gets points for even pretending to be Irish.  Point against them - the utter lack of vegetarian Irish/British options. I get that the Irish are not the MOST veg friendly ethnic group on the planet. I do. But I also grew up going to legit Irish places that had ploughman's platters, bubble and squeak, colcannon, etc. that can be eaten by anyone. Throw a veggie boxty in there or some champ. Americans will eat potatoes, don't worry. One of the best vegetarian cheeses in the world is produced in Ireland, in fact, many Irish cheeses are vegetarian and made on small local farms. So don't front, I know that the Irish make veggie food. Despite that issue, here's the true facts on this place - they make a ridiculously good salad. No, that doesn't sound very Irish, but I wasn't left with many Irish choices. Still, it was amazing. Baby spinach, red onion, roasted peppers, mandarin oranges and goat cheese (a lot of goat cheese), with a raspberry vinaigrette. Everyone in my house was trying to steal this salad from me. It was delicious. I also ordered up a side of curry chips which were passable, but a little too like American home fries or something. They should have been a bit crisper, but still. Curry chips. Those things are no joke, you could live on them for a long time. We also had the two desserts they offer through GrubHub, a chocolate Bailey's bread pudding and a Guinness brownie. Both of these were okay, but again, pull the America out of these things, please. You don't need chocolate in bread pudding. Bread has a mild enough flavor, don't overwhelm it with chocolate. Just throw some dried fruit in there. Really, for a few bucks a night, you could have two and just make bread pudding your signature. Make a traditional one with liquor soaked dried fruits and a ""hip"" chocolate one. I know which I'll choose. The brownie was okay, but so dense and so chocolately that I had trouble eating more than a bite. I passed it off on my girlfriend. I think my issue with the desserts here is that I don't like chocolate, and they make that the focus of the menu. There's no need. There are so many amazing traditional desserts that I can't get anywhere else, pick a couple of them and you'll be set. Finally, the reason they get so many points for great salad and mediocre desserts is that their menu has a number of honest to goodness Irish items on it that I can't eat. I hope they'll realize that the versatile potato, in conjunction with a couple of Irish cheeses and some market fruit would make them appeal to a wider array of people so that I can have a real Irish meal again, but they're TRYING. I respect that, a lot, and hope they know that some of us really appreciate them bringing a little bit of Ireland to Wicker Park.",0.9921,0.813,0.13,0.057,0.40606060606060596

The appetizers tasted like they had been from a frozen food box). The decor fits the place as an Irish hangout, however, the music was a clubby mix of Rihanna and Black Eyed Peas. Maybe because it was a Friday night and they have to compete with their neighbor-The Boundary?? Not very Irish to me. The waitress we had would disappear and it took us a bit to get our check (mind you it was a friday night, but it wasn't very busy at all). Second time: Decided to give it a second try and got Irish fare: Fish & Chips for the bf and the Mac & Cheese was for me (we thought that maybe the Irish food would be better and authentic). The mac and cheese was bland and not worth the price, while the fish & chips were pretty good. The bf ordered a Guinness and it wasn't good...I do have to comment that our waitress was very nice, but considering a 2 time let down, it's not enough for us to come back. All in all, we won't be back. Not an authentic Irish place and the food quality is just not there. What a disappointment.",0.9634,0.874,0.101,0.025,0.33853174603174596

In fact, we had our post-rehearsal dinner party here, and bought the middle of the road drink package here for about 35 people.   My only cause of concern, and probably the only reason why I'd not give this place 4 yelp stars is because after spending nearly $1500, they required a gratuity of 18%.  Since it was my wedding weekend, I figured this was more for my friends and family than myself, so you know, 'eff it'.  I paid it, but in hindsight I should have fought more, especially when we found out there were about 10 wristbands left not used, and we explicitly agreed that we'd get something kicked back, but I understood not all of it could be.   I'm not trying to be a dick, but man, the recession makes one out of everybody, patron and business owner.",-0.7263,0.851,0.066,0.082,0.596875

2009-10-26,3.0,"While I liked this bar, I wasn't crazy about the clientele who frequent it.  The Division Ale House is the latest addition to this stretch of bars along Division. And while it has alot going for it- it felt a little ""Lincoln Park-ey"" for me.  To start off, it looked like my kind of place. Victorian wallpaper, a 100 plus year old mirror on the wall, old stained glass window panels back lit as ambiance, Tiffany inspired lights and even a fireplace in the front area. There are books on the bookshelves and the bartender even told me that they brought Irish carpenters in to build the place. Couple that with the extensive use of dark woods and rich leathers and this bar looks exactly like a place I'd like to sit and catch up with friends.  They have bar darts in the back and plenty of TV's to watch whatever your favorite game is. And there is even a ""disco ball"" (do they still call them that?) hanging over an area in the back (is that a dance floor?- there was nothing happening there on the night I was there)  The menu is extensive with plenty of Irish favorites like an Irish breakfast, (served til 2:30 on the weekend's) Shepard's pie, corned beef and cabbage, fries with curry sauce and more. I had the burger with tater tots which was good as the meat is hand formed from ground sirloin- a little hard to keep together but definitely tasty! My friend had the bangers and mash which he said was good but nothing special.  The real winner of the evening was the Black and Tan Mac and cheese that was made with Irish bacon, cheddar cheese spiked with Guinness and Harp. Ding! Ding! Ding! We have a winner!  But then the downside. They serve these gigantic 80 ounce beer pitchers (complete with iced liners) which of course encourages all the 20 somethings in the area to stop in, drink too much and spend the rest of the night being stupid with the guys swearing at the top of their lungs and the girls being quieter but just as annoying.  Like I said- it was like Lincoln Park meets Wicker Park. Not a pretty sight.  Service was attentive and friendly and it is reasonably priced. Dinner for two with plenty of drinks ran around $45. Street parking is a bit of a challenge around here (especially on a weekend night) although many of the places nearby have valet service.  While I might be persuaded to go to watch a game on a Sunday afternoon (lots of drink specials) I doubt I will be back at night.

The spinach artichoke dip was good--although the pita crisps it came with were unnecessarily greasy.

I was really disappointed because we live on the block and would have liked to be patrons. We gave it a second chance and went in for dinner.

2009-08-01,2.0,"I think the mere fact that their margaritas were served in a 16 oz glass and very potent is one of the few things that kept a smile on my lil' face when walking out the door of this place last night.  I've come to the conclusion that Division Ale House has an identity crisis going on here. My friend told me she came during the week and the music was nice and low-key. Of course when we pop in there last night around 12:30 it's crowded (that's to be expected), but I did notice a couple things towards the back of the bar that made me giggle. 1) There was a disco ball which totally clashed with the decor and 2) there was a dj. Now, I suppose I would be ok with this whole situation if the dj had any talent, but I spent most of my time laughing at the mash ups. He must have been drunk too. Lose the dj!  I did notice the cool 80-ounce beer towers with a built-in core of ice at the table next to us. I'm more a beer drinker for dinners during the week and cocktails or wine on the weekends. I think the ice is a really bright idea, so I'll give them props for that. Lets talk about the service which is the main reason I was turned off from this place. I realize it's late..... BUT. Please just be friendly and quick. I know she didn't have many other tables so I'm not sure where she evaporated to for the 10 minutes it took for us to get out drinks (we were 5 feet from the service well). She would come by in between the 10 minutes and say (as if she'd forgotten to order the drinks) ""your drinks will be right up"" Fair enough. Just keep me posted. Turns out, my friend's dirty martini tasted fruity and it took another 15 minutes to flag the girl down to have it fixed. aye. Mistakes happen, that's totally fine, but maybe saying I'm sorry, would work. The girl just glared at my friend, picked up the drink and walked away.  Also, since this place just opened last week, another go is needed. All in all, I suppose I'll have to come back during the week when they don't have a god awful dj, and maybe when the service might be a little more decent.
