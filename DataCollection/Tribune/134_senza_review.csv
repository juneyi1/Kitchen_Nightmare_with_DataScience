Aesthetic plating with unique and innovative combinations of high-end ingredients that complimented each other to create cohesive, flavorful dishes. I am terribly sad that such a special place had to come to an end. I can only hope Senza reincarnates in the near future.",0.8176,0.673,0.215,0.111,0.5936507936507937

Each entree was nicely presented and decorated with floral display. Each bite was exceptional and reflect the natural taste of the item. The server was professional - each entree was well explained about origin and production. Our plates/utensils were changed after each and every entree.

I'm not sure exactly why all these Michelin-starred places have been closing lately, but I hope the trend does not continue.

2014-12-25,4.0,"I can only describe this as a symphony to the tongue and a feast for the eyes. Wow, I'm in awe of how poetic that last line sounded. ;-) In all seriousness, this is fine dining at its best. You can tell just looking at the plate and even before tasting it, how much the chef wants to make the dining experience as pleasing to the sense as possible. Each dish is impeccably garnished with beautifully edible flowers. Apparently, they're imported from Ohio! The whole experience is orchestrated like music -- a beautiful starter oyster to warm up your palate before crescendo-ing slowly to the main courses and then slowly mellowing down to the desserts.  A few dishes that stood out in my mind was the squid ink pasta and the foie gras that melted like butter on my tongue. The waygu beef was also top notch quality. My friend was very much impressed by the corn creme brulee.  Only two things detracted from the experience -- I didn't really appreciate that the bread was charred because it was too burnt for me to appreciate how gluten-free bread could taste so good! There was another dish that had ""ash"" but I just didn't get it. I don't want to taste powdered ash!  The service is really impeccable. The servers are top-notch. I accidentally dropped my napkin and before I even noticed what happened, a server picked it up and replaced it with a new one! I was thoroughly wowed by how much attention to detail they had. And they're not the pretentious kind. They were really gracious and inviting.  All in all, every dish was very well presented and the flavors are so light and unique. They are very pleasing to the tongue, and I'd recommend going if you have the money to shell!",0.9901,0.799,0.163,0.038,0.5768495768495767

2014-08-26,4.0,"I had heard a lot of great things about Chicago's fine dining scene and was really excited to try out a place like Senza while I was in town. I've eaten at a fair number of Michelins, and while Senza is different, it's refreshingly so, and certainly deserving of its first star. The reason I took off one star was for the Japanese A5 Wagyu with caviar that was one of our first courses, and the one I was the most excited for. I LOVE wagyu, so it's definitely something I look forward to when a restaurant is able to put it on their menu. I've had wagyu similarily prepared at other Michelin restaurants, and the way this one was done was absolutely TERRIBLE. I'm not sure what it was, but the two bites literally tasted like I had swallowed a cup of ocean water - deathly salty, to the point where I was near gagging and had to hide my disgust by chugging a whole glass of water. My mom simply couldn't eat hers, and we are the kinds of people who can handle extreme flavor spectrums. Our waitress said it might have been the caviar, but I have definitely had Osetra caviar before, and that is NOT what I remember it tasting like. We had one of our servers alert the kitchen, and he said he would, but a few courses later, I followed up to ask if he had told the chef (because our main waitress, nor anyone from the kitchen, had said anything about it to us), and he said he hadn't but that he would. We had a feeling that he wasn't going to tell them, and sure enough, he hadn't. As soon as we followed up, our main waitress and the hostess came around apologizing for the dish, which was appreciated, but I know they wouldn't have if we didn't follow up. I doubt either of them really let the chef know. Here's where high-level customer service takes two different routes. At any other Michelin-rated restaurant I've been to in SF where I returned a dish because it was simply not edible (hey, it happens - chefs are human and are not perfect all the time), I've been offered something to make up for it, and they are usually extremely receptive to feedback and improving their cuisine. Senza? It seemed like they tried to gloss over the mistake, which I didn't like. Had it not been for that, and I would have given this place 5 stars. Aside from that, my mom and I loved almost every other dish they put out in front of us. We especially loved all the seafood courses - the sturgeon, kusshi oyster, duck breast and foie gras, and the chilled soup especially stood out. The cheese was really, really, really heavy, especially being served at the end of our dinner, but everything else was beautiful. Service: definitely a notch less formal than I am used to receiving at Michelins, but that seems to be a characteristic of many Chicago dining establishments - really dim lighting, rustic looking wooden tables sans tablecloth, and a classy yet casual atmosphere. It was extremely loud inside the restaurant, which I also don't personally prefer. I had to raise my voice considerably to talk to my mom across the table, and strain to hear what she said. That lasted until people started finishing their meals and the restaurant began to clear out - after that, it was peaceful and perfect. I enjoyed it, but I think I prefer the formality of SF's service, as it really completes the whole experience and seems more focused on giving each individual customer an end-to-end dining experience that covers all the bases. Was it good? Yes. Was it great? Yes. Was it mindblowing, and would I have to come back? No.",0.998,0.791,0.165,0.044,0.5486171236171238
2014-08-21,5.0,"We went here for my birthday, and Happy Birthday to me!!!!   We ordered the whole she-bang, including wine pairings.  I like nothing more than turning in a menu and having a chef tell me what to eat.  They're the professionals, after all.   I must mention, before I rant, that our whole menu was GLUTEN FREE.  I myself in no way have a gluten allergy, and I'm sometimes frustrated by those who have gravitated toward the fad of a gluten free diet when they themselves don't have celiac disease.  However, I certainly sympathize with the plight of those who do.  It was extremely refreshing that, AFTER the meal, our waiter said ""by the way, that whole meal was gluten free!"".  We were pleasantly surprised with the fact that it was gluten free and that the restaurant's attitude wasn't in-your-face, rather, matter-of-fact.   On to the food.  Wow, wow, wow.  I don't think there was a single thing that wasn't outstanding.  The plating was beautiful.  If you visit their website, the pictures of the food on the homepage is literally how the food looks on your plate.  Two dishes stood out to me in particular.  They were the chilled vidalia onion soup and the Snake River Sturgeon.  There was a mind-bending amount of flavor packed in to the onion soup.  The sturgeon was extremely interesting.  I can't say I've eaten sturgeon before, and the experience was impressive.   It's really tough to write reviews of places like this - places where simply everything about the experience rocked.

2014-08-20,5.0,"Came here for dinner and had the nine course menu. It's not often I go to a place like this, so I went all out and went for the wine pairings as well. Have to admit, I never quite understood what it meant for x food to go with y wine... fish with white, steak with red... okay, I got that, but it wasn't apparent to me how the correct pairing could make such a huge difference in the taste of the meal. But oh man, were the pairings phenomenal at Senza. Each one brought out a particular accent of the dish it complemented. It was like the difference between seeing a black and white photo versus one in color. I cannot recommend the pairings enough. I used to skip these whenever I could to cut the cost, but I would rather eat out less often and save up for a meal with the pairings. For a few of the dishes, some of the elements were a bit too salty when taken alone. (I saw this point made in a few negative reviews.) You gotta mix and match and resist the temptation to try each ingredient individually (cuz let's get honest -- the portions aren't big enough for that, haha).  Beautifully plated. Elegant is the world. Not at all gimmicky or overdone, like some other top end Chicago restaurants. Lots of dishes garnished with edible flowers. A place working under the gluten-free restriction really has to have a lot of creativity... I wouldn't even call gluten-free a restriction in this case. The service here cannot be beat. If you tell them that you have a special occasion for your dinner, they will print you a customized menu for you to take home. If you have no special occasion, fret not, for you still get the menu without the message. Staff was incredibly nice, took the time to introduce and explain every course and pairing. Very personal service. Favorite course of the night? Hard to say... But looking at pictures of the fois gras has me drooling all over my keyboard. I would give this place 6 stars if I could. My mind was blown so many times by all the incredible flavor combinations I tried and my eyes cried whenever I ate anything because they didn't want the beautiful presentations to disappear. I can't wait to return to this place. It won't be soon, but it will be someday. On a side note, I ate here on the night of the World Naked Bike Ride.

The first time we went, you could get the five course meal but had the option to select between various alternative courses. This time we couldn't choose anything, we had to just stick with the five courses, which annoyed me as I really wanted to try some of the other options in that were available in the 11 course meal but not in the 5 course meal. I then thought about just getting the 11 course meal but they said we couldn't do that because our entire table of four would have to get the 11 course meal, and not everyone at our table wanted 11 courses.

For what this place is pretending to be, food was pretty bad. We had this piece of lamb covered in ""ash"" for our entree! Every time I think about it, I cannot get the taste and the image out of my mind. I gave it three  stars instead of one because the wine pairing as well as the service deserves a solid five-star rating.  Not sure what happened with the food  when we went there. Maybe they got a new chef, or the chef got drunk and wanted to do something really bold. Well, bold it was. In fact, even if the piece of lamb ( the size of the whole entree was one bite, by the way, I am not even talking about a full sized lamb chop) was not covered in ash, I would still rate it poorly, because it was pretty hard to chew; at that level, you expect any piece of meat to melt in your mouth. So, bad recipe was paired with bad ingredients. I will speculate that  some of the good reviews are by tourists. I would say go give this a place try if you really must, but if you are a foodie  ( or from San Francisco bay area which naturally makes you a food snob), do not keep your expectations high.",0.7205,0.882,0.079,0.039,0.5983172635445361

Let me say, the courses were extremely small to me.  They were so small that after dinner we walked up to Flub a Chubs and gorged on burgers, fries, mozz sticks, and onion rings...no lie. I was expecting more things that were made differently without gluten (pasta, bread, etc).  They barely had any of that...they stuck to meat, veggies, etc.  Its not that difficult to be gluten free when you just use things that dont have gluten anyway.  I totally expected something different...like amazing gluten free pasta, a baked good for dessert, etc.  This was definitely not the case, unfortunately. It seemed the flavor profile was off.  The would have a soup that was creamy, onion, etc and then have a citrus, bitter addition...not good.   The lamb was extremely small and super salty/garlic-y.  The jelly and mustard did not go well with it.  Nothing was that great...however my favorite things were the bread (we each got one small 2 inch square piece) and the cheese course. Everything else was severely lacking.

We ordered the 9-course tasting menu.  It started with a surprise amuse bouche Kumamoto oyster.  It was my first oyster and I loved it.  It was a great combination of a little sweet and a little spicy.   The first scheduled course was the Chilled Spring Onion Soup with Alaskan king crab, orange, lemongrass, and green garlic froth.  I told Molli that I didn't like onion or chilled soup so I was not excited for this dish.  Boy was I wrong.  It was the best dish of the night for me, and the quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten.  I'm serious, the soup was that good.  It had big bold clean flavors.  Every spoonful was a close your eyes and savor the moment experience.  Molli and I both would have drunk a barrel of this soup.   Next came the Wagyu beef tartare with w/ mustard panna cotta, cabbage and caraway.  It was tender, tasty and left you wanting more. Then our servers brought out the Snake River Sturgeon with charred lardo, kumquat, harissa, and fermented ramps. This was a wonderful combination of delicate fish with the buttery bacony flavor of the lardo and garlicy flavor of the fresh ramps...scrumptious. Next came the Berkshire Pork Belly with coriander meringue, szechuan pepper, celery and anise hyssop.  This also was one of the really good dishes. It was savory and mouthwateringly flavorful because the pork was perfectly cooked. Next came the Poached Loup de Mer  (European sea bass) with crispy skin, artichoke, smoked roe (sturgeon caviar), shisito consommé.  They also served us a Caraway seed loaf of bread with whipped butter for this dish.  This was Molli's favorite dish of the night.  She would have thrown me out the door to get at that rich deliciously flavorful consommé.  I wouldn't have blamed her.  The whole dish was dazzling and sopping up that consommé with the bread was heavenly.  This course was my second favorite -- absolutely delicious!  Next came the Berkshire pork rib with toasted marshmallow, lingonberry purée and celeriac, coriander, anise hyssop.  The meat was fall of the bone tender and succulent. Who would have thought pork rib with marshmallow, but it worked brilliantly. This was an excellent dish and our third favorite of the night. The pork rib was followed by Roasted Rack of Lamb with onion ash, braised cippolini onions, lamb belly, pickled mustard seeds, nasturtium and lamb jus.  It was a decent course but our least favorite of the night.  The rack of lamb was a bit chewy for me. Next came the Aerated Raclette membrillo stuffed éclair with raisin, pancetta, and basil buds.  It was velvety luscious and yummy! Lastly, was the Oatmeal, pine nut, sherry vanilla ice cream with toasted marshmallow and toasted marshmallow meringue. It was delectable but I was so full I could barely enjoy it. All in all it was a great food experience.  It was fine dining as far as the food, presentation and service with a laid back (no dress code) ambiance.  Three of the dishes were out of this world because of the layering of big bold distinct flavors.  It will be difficult to match how delicious they were.  The rest of the courses ranged from very good to good except for the lamb, which was a little bit of a miss for us. The service was also excellent.  We had a courteous staff of waiters and waitresses that did an outstanding job the whole night.  They deserve 5 stars for sure.  Lastly, it was expensive and very filling so be prepared.  If you can splurge -- it's a wonderful food experience.",0.9988,0.793,0.178,0.029,0.5885851851851852
2014-06-29,4.0,"4.5 stars.  Other restaurants I have visited that do extended tasting menus are Alinea and Tru. Compared to those two, Senza is right at the border of being readily accessible by the general populace in terms of flavor profile and ingredients, and also high-end and modern at the same (whereas the other two are not as approachable). My cousin took me here for my graduation dinner on a Tuesday night and we each opted for the 9-course tasting menu at $135.  Favorites:  - Snake River Sturgeon: a small filet of sturgeon with a piece of lardo draped over it (which is charred at your table). The sturgeon is so succulent and flavorful, and the lardo provides enough richness and fat to make the dish really delicious. Yum.   - Chilled Spring Onion soup: I wasn't particularly excited about this one when I saw it on the menu, but it was a pleasant surprise. The soup tasted very spring-y - fresh, lots of bright notes, and delicate flavors. The sweet king crab meat also added to the light flavors.  - Berkshire pork rib: Meat was fall off the bone tender, and the slight asian flavor profile was really great.  The other dishes were also great for the most part: oyster starter (beautiful presentation, sweet), poached loup de mer (I was really excited about this reading it on the menu, and although it was good, it wasn't particularly special), hokkaido scallop (scallop was beautifully seared, as was the foie gras), roasted rack of lamb (I hate lamb, but thought the meat was cooked well - minimized the distinct stench of lamb that makes it hate this meat to begin with. I will say, however, that the flavor and the texture of the powdered lamb fat really threw me off and I could not finish it), klug farm strawberries (again, very spring-y; light and fruity flavors),  oatmeal streusel (more of a filling dessert than the previous strawberry course, not particularly memorable but I do remember it being good). Unlike other restaurants of this caliber, the servers were definitely more approachable and warm. They even joked around with us a couple times, which was nice. Despite this more casual atmosphere, they are still thorough with their service (i.e. clear out silverware after every course, explain your dish, etc.) Interior is VERY unassuming. If this had been the location of a rather casual restaurant, I would not have been surprised. Again, added to the ""casual/high-end"" juxtaposition that the restaurant possesses.  Presentation was absolutely beautiful. They like using edible flowers for decoration, which allows them to add a lot of interesting colors that are otherwise difficult to find in food (purples, for example).  The minus 0.5 stars comes from the slight lack of creativity that I look for in restaurants of this caliber. Yes, sometimes creativity can mean that ingredients become so altered that the food starts becoming unapproachable, but I think this creativity really keeps diners on their feet and allows us to marvel at the wonders of modern cooking. Thus, while all the food at Senza was good (and really good at that!), sometimes it was so approachable that it lost some of it's ""wow"" factor.  However, still highly recommend a visit here. Food was great and approachable, and presentation was absolutely beautiful.",0.9984,0.757,0.195,0.047,0.5895073260073261

2014-06-09,5.0,"Insanity. I hardly have words. (aka I'm about to write a buttload of words.) The location was great for us, as it was two blocks from our hotel. But we walked right by it at first because it's not on a block in Lakeview (between Boystown and Lincoln Park) that screams, ""Come get fine dining next to the cheapest looking nail salon and used book store!"" I suppose that gives it the ""hidden gem"" or ""diamond in the rough"" appeal. We arrived at 7pm on a Friday, and there were only a few other diners in the small establishment. I'd say it started to fill up around 8pm. Upon our first step in and our last step out, the service was inviting and attentive. That sounds so cliche, but what we experienced was perfect hospitality from the hostess and several waiters who clearly served to please. Our welcome was warm, our glasses stayed filled, our food was delivered in a timely fashion and with thorough introduction, and our questions were answered.  We got the 5 course prix fixe which included an additional course and an amuse-bouche for $85/pp + tax + tip. Definitely a splurge for us, but hey, this is fine dining in Chicago, ya turkey! We couldn't not try at least one cocktail, so we ordered the Stony Point for $12. The cocktail had bourbon, ginger, thai chiles, and mint, so though it had a little kick, it was balanced and refreshing. I thought the cocktail was a great value, as it was well-crafted, unique, and was a generous amount. My photos and their descriptions should provide ample information on each thing we ate, so I will spare you every single agonizing already-illustrated detail and just tell you the highlights. For me: the spring onion soup. I think this was a culinary MASTERPIECE. I found it perfectly executed because every single element of taste was complemented by another. Like the rich creaminess of the ""soup"" base complemented by the fresh zest of the orange and lemongrass. And the sweet king crab complemented by the salty garlic emulsion and savory rosemary. Every flavor was distinguishable and delicious even when all combined together. A highlight for the both of us was the amuse-bouche oyster. Again, the sweet and salty, but fresh, combo cannot be dominated. My boyfriend just closed his eyes and shook his head for a good 60 seconds when this met his mouth. The foie gras provoked the same reaction from him. It was, of course, melt-in-your-mouth insanity. So insane that he tried to grab some off my plate, which is the craziest goddamn thing any grown man can do. Also allow me to rant and rave about how pork belly is old news and lamb belly is where it's at. Way more flavorful and tender, or at least the sexy stuff that Senza serves is! My boyfriend said the Oatmeal streusel was fighting for first place in his rankings, but I did not try it because it contained pine nuts (F you, allergies!!!). But it contained ""pine nut nougat, apricot, sherry ice cream, dreamsicle"". At the end of the meal, after wiping my tears of joy, I was able to get a peak at the kitchen and received an autographed menu from Chef Sandoval (*fan-girl squeal*). (A not so savory after-note: My boyfriend and I both got very upset stomachs the next day. We are convinced it was due to dinner, and I was contemplating subtracting a star, but will give Senza the benefit of the doubt, just in case. If it WAS because of the richness of our food, then it was worth it?)",0.9975,0.76,0.171,0.068,0.5221301020408163
2014-06-01,5.0,"I love Senza. There isn't a single thing I dislike about it. The atmosphere is absolutely perfect. Intimate but not cramped, elegant but not stuffy. It's a very small restaurant but the decor is very charming. The staff has always been incredibly pleasant. My wife has celiac, so we came here based on the gluten free premise alone. I had heard good things, but I did not expect anything near what we experienced. I am not a gluten free eater. I love gluten, and I love food. Despite all that, Senza is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Aside from the gluten free rye bread we were served with dinner (which my wife went nuts over), I didn't once during either of my 2 dinners here think ""This is really good for gluten free."" I just thought, ""This is an absolutely delicious meal."" The flavors are surprising and inventive. The plating is exquisite. Superb attention to detail. The second time we ate here, it was with my father-in-law who is also gluten free. It was his birthday, so the chef offered to take a complementary shot of whisky with him. As if that wasn't enough, by day a very nice gluten free bakery/cafe operates out of the same space. Again, as someone who regularly eats gluten, I still find their flatbreads, quiche, donuts, and breakfast sandwiches incredibly good. If you're celiac, or even just trying to live a gluten free lifestyle, you should do whatever it takes to have dinner here.

2014-04-01,5.0,"***Along with Acadia, Senza might be the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago as well as one of the very best restaurants in the country*** Chicago is my favorite city for high-end cuisine because so many restaurants here utilize modern cooking techniques to deliver really creative and unique food that is new, delicious and undoubtedly original.  Many high-end Chicago restaurants also only feature one or two tasting menus; this allows guests to enjoy a great variety of ingredients and preparations as well as creates more of an identity that limits the choices you have to make.  Guests here can leave knowing that they really experienced the restaurant and were not just plagued by poor choices. With these extensive tasting menus though, occasionally a course does not work.  With several Chicago restaurants, some courses (typically only a few) get a little too whimsical.  The course works at tantalizing the mind but not at creating a satisfying and delicious flavor and texture combination.  Senza though utilizes modern techniques to really create fresh and new food while still allowing guests to take pleasure in a perfectly seared scallop or enjoy a warm root vegetable soup. Senza reminds me of San Francisco's Sons & Daughters, which is another restaurant where the food is very modern but also approachable and classic at the same time.  Also like that restaurant, Senza is a small place that feels like a real find.  The restaurant has a casual neighborhood cafe look, but there are elegant touches throughout the room like the nice table centerpieces here. Senza features two tasting menus.  There is a 9-course tasting menu as well as a 5-course tasting menu (and this menu is just an abbreviated version of the longer menu).  The longer tasting menu starts with a few amuses--a fresh west coast oyster topped with some good heat from a chili sauce and a refreshing beer ice as well as a hamachi shooter with yuzu, fragrant cucumber blossoms and dashi bubbles that really explode with the savoriness of that Japanese broth. The first course was a perfectly seared scallop (crispy on the top, very moist and soft as well as nicely seasoned) that sat next to seared foie gras (very creamy but also a distinct crust), preserved blueberries, crunchy granola, onion caramel, and charred leeks (crispy on the outside but also with the texture of a braised onion). The next course was a warm and hearty parsnip soup with a strong punch from horseradish cream.  There were great garnishes too like potato, soft butter poached lobster and crispy guanciale.  The soup kept changing and developing flavors, which was really satisfying though I did think the abundance of dried cherries was too much. An excellent loup de mer came next and it was flawlessly cooked (moist and flaky); there were lots of fun textures too like crispy trout skin and juicy trout roe. An indulgent piece of pork belly followed, which was flavorful without being too rich or fatty.  The outside was crisp, but there was also a tender braised meat-like experience.  The fat was rendered down very well and it turned almost creamy.  Garnishes included fragrant greens and toasted marshmallow. Next was a really good morel agnolotti, which combined satisfyingly thick pasta with a creamy and strong mushroom center.  Garnishes included very good black truffle, excellent morels and sweet and tart kumquats. The main course was lamb two ways (very juicy and tender belly and the more entree-like lamb rack though the rack was slightly overcooked).  There were fun touches with this course like garlic chips and onion ash, but there was also a straightforward but delicious cippolini onion. There is a strong attention to detail everywhere including the hearty, warm and toasted caraway loaf (Senza is also a gluten-free restaurant). The cheese course was fun, creamy and pungent cheese in a soup amuse presentation with great quince.  The first dessert was very creamy and pronounced vanilla ice cream paired with great apricots, marshmallow and crunchy oats.  The second dessert featured a chocolate butterscotch cake (great flavor though dry like a lot of flourless cakes) with excellent garnishes including orange bitters meringue and butterscotch ice cream. Service was excellent--very personable but also professional, polite and polished. Prices are high, but the 5-course tasting menu is reasonable given the quality of the food here. Senza is a truly special restaurant.  It has the innovative touches of a high-end Chicago restaurant as well as the vibrant flavors and light preparations of the Bay Area's very best restaurants.  I really enjoyed Acadia and felt that it might put out more exciting and more nicely prepared food than Senza, but Senza is still very special and one of the very best restaurants I have been to in Chicago; Senza would also be one of the best restaurants I have experienced across the country.

We are both passionate about food but are not into super formal dining experiences so we were a little hesitant when we saw online that the restaurant offers two prix fixe menus only (5 courses or 9 courses). However, the reviews on Yelp are so good we thought we would give it a try. As soon as we walked in, we couldn't have been more surprised at how relaxed and warm the ambiance was. Carol, the restaurant manager, was very gracious and thanked us for our patience as our table wasn't quite ready when we arrived. We chose the 9- course menu. Our server, Tory, was very nice and attentive as well as quite knowledgeable about wine. The entire floor staff were extremely efficient and gracious. We were offered two amuse bouches to start, a very delicious oyster and a hamachi dish. All the dishes on the menu were beautifully presented and tasty. The agnolotti was just a tad overly salted. Our favorite savory course was the loup de mer with its crispy skin. The oatmeal dessert was absolutely amazing.  Kudos to Chef Noah and his team.   The Michelin star is well deserved. Last but not least, the brown gluten free bread made with rice flour was just stunning!  I never thought gluten free anything could taste that good!!!!!!!

2014-03-13,4.0,"Belated Yelp review, I ate here this past Saturday to celebrate my best friend's birthday. I was visiting Chicago for a second time, with one mission in tow, to pack in as many buzzed-about, Michelin star restaurants into an extended weekend as possible. With that in mind, I researched all of the Michelin restaurants' menus ahead of my trip, and after much back and forth decided on Senza for my first dinner, the menu seemed not too overboard, but still unique enough to merit a try. Little did I know, that I obviously didn't do my research that well, as I did not find out that this restaurant was gluten-free until I arrived. Much to my surprise, I loved the gluten-free food (this is coming from someone that has never opted for the gluten free options that are becoming oh so popular on menus now-a-days; I mean half of my tags on instagram are #Ilovecarbs). Food: (Disclaimer: I am not going to lie, I LOVE food, but by no means am I a self-proclaimed ""foodie"" that can remember and elaborate on every single ingredient in the dishes, I can just tell you if I thought they were good or not, take it for what it is) We opted for the 5 course prix fixe. They started us off with an amouse bouche of a very refreshing oyster.  1. Scallop with foie gras, really good start to the meal, the foie was seared perfectly 2. Parsnip soup: My best friend's favorite dish of the night, it was tasty but not mind-blowing in my opinion 3. Agnolotti: My favorite dish of the night! Layer upon layer of flavors 4. Loup de mer/Lamb: We shared these two dishes so we could each get a taste. The fish was very light and refreshing and I really enjoyed the sauce it was in. The lamb was cooked perfectly, but I have to say I preferred the fish over the lamb (my friend preferred the lamb, to each their own). 5. Chocolate cake with butterscotch sorbet: I wasn't a huge fan of the dessert, I actually opted to give the rest of my dessert to my friend. It was perfectly fine, but just that, fine. Not as good as the other courses throughout the night. Service: Now this says a lot that I am actually noting the service. I usually only care about the food, even if I have horrible service I can turn a blind eye if the food is good enough. The service at Senza was fantastic! Of all the restaurants I have been to, including  3-star Michelin's, this is the best service I have ever received.

2014-02-24,5.0,"Senza-- the Italian word for without. This Chicago eatery brings out the best flavors of simple ingredients without compromising flavor. You will leave this restaurant without an empty stomach, without a wish for better service, and without a desire for anymore that simply was. When you walk in, the hostess automatically takes your coats and lead you to your table. Luckily, we had a reservation.   Senza has a gastropub feel but a bit more upscale and classy. Dress code is like an elegant casual There are two options: the five course prix fixe and ten course tasting menus. We opted for the ten, hoping for a more complete experience. The entire table must order the same, which is unfortunate but understandable.  Everything was delicious. The Kumamoto oyster was the perfect way to start our meal.  The wagyu tartare was also luxuriously delicious. It was like a deconstructed hamburger: raw beef, mustard panna cotta, etc.  I'm always excited to see foie gras since it is banned in California (and used to be in Chicago). The scallop that accompanied it was also perfectly cooked and had a nice crust.  The loup de mer was pretty good: I liked the crispy skin, but the fish taste was a little too fishy.  I also really liked the agnolotti. The pasta was one of the few agnolotti that I've tried that wasn't too salty. The filling was nice and creamy and the huckleberry and kumquat provided the perfect amount of sweetness.  The pork belly is the only dish I wasn't a big fan. It was cooked perfectly, but I didn't like the celery and celery root pairing. The lamb was also pretty tasty. I preferred the seared version better than the sausage.  It was a perfect medium rare. The sausage had a lot if spices and reminded me of a Mongolian hotpot flavor.  Desserts were also pretty good. The oatmeal was like an upscale parfait, and the chocolate fruit pair is always yum.

I love food.  I love gluten. I had no idea that this place was a gluten-free restaurant, and more importantly I still didn't know after leaving until I read the reviews below.  Seriously!?

The meal was really well balanced.  The oyster shooter was gorgeous and delicious.  Next we had the scallop, and I never experienced shallots with blueberries, but the pairing was really so lovely! The carmelized onion sauce was also spot-on delicious. The parsnip soup was very very good.  My husband said it was the best he's ever had... and I'd place it just a notch below the corn soup I had at goosefoot. The agnolotti (gluten free?!?) was incredible.  We had a mushroom version since we're a pain in the butt, but it was truly delicious. Next we had sea bass.  That was probably my least favorite course, but by no means was it bad... it was just not as exciting as the others.  The skin was served separately and it was crispy and delicious and I'm normally someone who avoids fish skin. Last we had two different desserts, the chocolate and the oatmeal.  Both were fantastic.  The service was great, informative and non-pretentious.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who asked.

They were very accommodating of her food allergies and the entire menu is gluten free.  The parsnip soup was really amazing and they have gf a dairy free version. She also got a little Meyer lemon soda for the cheese course instead of the cheese that I got. Was really interesting experience and I would love to go back.  Definitely a special occasion type place. No ala carte menu just two options for 5 or 10 course tasting menus.

2014-01-05,4.0,"This little place owns a Michelin star and deservedly so.  The food adroitly dances the fine line between molecular and traditional.   I appreciate how every course has some ""out there"" elements but is still recognizable as real food.  We had the tasting menu, 11 courses for $125.  9 savory courses and 2 desserts.  Gluten free - never would have guessed. I have to applaud the savory courses.  This was some of the best food I've had in a long time.  The first course was an amuse of freshly shucked oyster on the half shell, with Virginia ham consommé, mint and finger lime.  OMG, that was a tasty bite!  If you haven't had finger lime, it's like lime caviar - a natural boba filled with tangy citrus.  Wow. A parade of deliciousness followed, with highlights including the parsnip soup with lobster, guanciale and horseradish cream.  The combination of parsnip and horseradish was a revelation; the accompanying house made gluten-free pumpernickel rye bread was crazy good.  The lamb tartare was expertly prepared, meltingly tender and surprisingly not too gamey.  Perhaps the star of the night was the agnolotti, a folded ravioli filled with yellowfoot mushrooms, served with black trumpet mushrooms, kumquat, huckleberry and dark chocolate.  A true umami bomb, we sat in awed silence after each bite. If I had a criticism for the savory dishes it would be that some of them included maybe one or two elements that weren't really necessary and possibly complicated things a bit too much.  That being said, I enjoyed every last morsel. The two desserts were not as successful.  I'm not so much a dessert guy but these were definitely not up to the quality of the savory courses.  There were no ""wows"" in the desserts. Service was attentive, our water glasses stayed full, and the food came out without too much delay.  The wine and cocktail programs were good.  They even have celery soda - tasted pretty good actually!  If not for the pedestrian desserts, this would easily have been a 5 star review.",0.9956,0.758,0.195,0.047,0.5557017543859649

2014-01-02,5.0,"Given Senza's convenient location in residential Lakeview, my boyfriend and I decided to ring in 2014 with Senza's freshly minted star. Senza took kindly to the ""mint"" part of that with floral, fragrant, and herbal accents throughout the five course tasting menu and cocktails. A special treat if you're debating between the five vs. ten course is one is able to select your course independently of your party (mind you all must do the same course number) and therefore two people could conceivably order all ten items on the menu. When we arrived at Senza the hostess was very nice, as was the entirety of the staff throughout the evening. The hostess even opened the door for us when we walked up, and she had a pleasant, informal greeting. We were seated in the corner table, which was nice and cozy on the snowy evening. I loved everything about the atmosphere, from the window into the kitchen to the sound absorbent tiles on the ceiling which allowed the small restaurant to be rather quiet. As mentioned before, we opted for the five course tasting menu, with two cocktails as opposed to the wine pairings. An amuse bouche was delivered first, which started the evening off right with what my boyfriend describes as a ""culinary rollercoaster."" The oyster took our mouths through a variety of flavors, from ham to mint, and provided a sign that we had a great evening ahead of us. Also, the plating for every dish was beautiful and sophisticated- a feast for the eyes and mouths. For the first course I ordered lamb tartare, one of my favorite dishes of the night, while my boyfriend ordered the scallops. One of my favorite things about the tartare was the variety of familiar flavors melded perfectly, and the caraway cracker, though small, was delicious. The scallop was moist, tender, and not chewy as scallops can often be. While there was a lot of blueberry on the plate, my boyfriend assured me he would order it again. Next up was parsnip soup, which was the only course that did not give two options to choose from. The presentation was beautiful, with all elements of the soup arranged in the bowl before the creamy broth was poured into the bowl tableside. Gluten-free rye bread was also served and tasty, especially with the salted butter. Pork belly was our third course and enjoyed by everyone. I especially liked the pickled celery on the side.The kitchen cooked the pork belly perfectly, but I think my favorite was the duck, our fourth course. The duck, served slightly blackened, was perfect on it's own, from the spices on the outside, to the way it was cooked, to the tenderness the meat. I could have eaten this alone for my fourth course, but it was also served on a bed of black trumpet mushrooms and various other emulsions and sauces. If you take one thing away from this review, it should be that the duck should not be missed. Before our dessert course we were offered a small cheese course, which was interesting and delectable at the same time. Dessert was good, although I would not say it was the highlight of the meal given the excellence of the other four courses, and the fact there was nothing in the desserts which made them stand out. All in all, this was a great dinner! If Senza changed their menu up I would definitely be back sooner rather than later. Also, I asked for a menu before leaving and the staff was lovely, printing off two menus with the date and the items we ordered highlighted and putting them in a envelope. The service really couldn't be beat.",0.9981,0.848,0.148,0.004,0.5443760262725781
2013-12-28,5.0,"A star has risen; a Michelin star that is, and most deservingly so. I had heard of Senza but had mixed feelings given this is a gluten free restaurant.  Embracing a gluten free diet means no bread, pasta, pizza, breakfast cereals..... Seriously??  What is life without pasta and pizza!  The name ""Senza"" after all comes from the Italian word for ""without"".  Guess I was having visions of gluten-free advocates Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham.  Was Senza a result of another celebrity inspired fad?     They had me at hello.  Literally. Rule #1 - Just do the 11 course prixe fixe menu with the wine pairings.  Yes, it's a bit pricey. Rule #2 - Come ""seriously"" hungry and I mean starving.  Even then, you'll start to feel full about 1/2 way through the meal.  The staff will however pace things over about three hours.  Stretch out dinner as long as you can so you can savor everything. Upon walking in, you discover a comfy and intimate place with the seats against the wall lined with comfortable cushions.  I had mentioned to the restaurant that my husband wouldn't eat fin fish or roe.  Upon seating, we were presented with personalized menus that already included my husband's restrictions.   While my menu included loup de mer (sea bass),  my husband's menu featured short rib.  Nice!! Every dish was stunningly constructed, beautiful to photograph, and even better when eaten.   Slices of scallop were accompanied by a dollops of caramel, blueberry, and decorated with cipollini, a very tasty onion.  Then there was the lusciously dreamy parsnip soup with lobster, a sliver of guanciale, with a dab of caviar on top.  Mix it all up, dive in, and sop up whatever's remaining with..........yes............""gluten free bread"".    All the time, there's a little voice in your head that keeps saying - ""stop eating all that bread, you're going to be sooooo full"". What made the loop de mer remarkable for me was the cardamom.  I drink cardamom flavored hot tea and would have never imagined the spice as an accompany to  fish! The pork belly and lamb tartare were so beautiful that I kept photographing them.  They were also without a doubt a couple of the stand-out dishes of the meal.  The tartare, decorated with cabbage was down pat the best I've ever had.  The mustard that accompanied was subtle but so complimentary.  Since my husband doesn't eat any raw food, it suffices to say that I had two helpings of lamb tartare.  Super Yum.  Just when you think it can't get any better.............here comes the duck, yet another stupendous offering.  Sliced duck with duck sausage, garlic,  and fig jam to give it all that zing.  I was so mesmerized, I really couldn't stop eating. Desserts were quite simply the exclamation points to one of the finest meals I've had in Chi Town.  Crunchy oatmeal with dreamy ice cream and rich chocolate with butterscotch.  Oh, what an end that was; I couldn't even find room for my obligatory coffee.  The pairings worked perfectly with each dish to say the least.  Mostly French and Italian wines, and a mix of white and red.  The Michigan sparkling cider  was uniquely paired with the pork belly and I loved the crisp sweetness of the Elio Perrone Moscato with the oatmeal.  Also of particular interest was the 2003 Scacciadiavoli, a deep red dessert wine for the chocolate. While raving about the food and drink, I must take a moment to recognize the stellar staff and impeccable service.  These guys really know their stuff. I can't say I have any plans on switching to a gluten free diet.  The thought of giving up Giordano's stuffed pizza and Honey Nut Cheerios is pretty unbearable.  I would however surely run back to Senza in a heartbeat.",0.9989,0.807,0.172,0.02,0.5333447108447108

So when a friend suggested our holiday dinner here and that it was ""Gluten free"" I was skeptical about what this place was about, but a mere visit to their website and I was hooked!  I loved that it was ""fine dining in a casual environment"" and I loved even more knowing that Chef Noah Sandoval (Schwa, Spring) was at the helm creating masterpieces of food that looked as good as they tasted. The decor is simple and unassuming.  There is a banquette along one wall with comfy, colorful pillows to arrange behind you so that you are comfortable.  We sat at one of the free standing tables (this place is intimate) for our large group of 5. James, our server extraordinaire came quickly to our table and after some helpful banter about the drink menu, and the food, had us quickly drinking some of their specialty cocktails.  I had one with Bourbon and ginger that had some type of spicy bitters in it that made my lips burn . . .but in an amazing way.  And my friend went with a vodka drink made with lemon and lime that was sweet and tangy. As for the menu- you can choose a 5 course tasting menu or the larger 10 course menu.  Just know that everyone at the table has to have the same menu- and in our case- there were food allergies at the table that prohibited the 10 course menu so 5 it was. There are choices to be made on the five course menu as three of the sections require you to choose this or that.  They all sounded so interesting, I just let James do the picking for me and he was spot on. I won't go through every thing we had but a few of the real standouts were the scallops, the pork belly and the duck.  So beautifully plated and so delicious!  The 5 course dinner ran about $75 a person and they have wine pairings available for each course for an additional $40. The entire evening was fabulous!  A night to enjoy amazing food, served by people who clearly love what they do in an atmosphere that is not pretentious but almost home like.  And I love the re purposing of the space during the morning hours as it turns into a coffee shop with Gluten free baked goods (and if the bread we had was any indication of that they can do without gluten, I'd say they have a winner on their hands ALL day!)

2013-11-29,5.0,"First, my most sincere thanks is extended to the entire Senza team for crafting the greatest meal I've ever had the pleasure of indulging in, all wrapped around a warm and inviting atmosphere. A bit of backstory: My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Chicago...simply to eat and drink wine. He told me I could choose one epic restaurant at which to dine. We're currently living on two sides of the US and love to eat together, so I wanted to find a place that both of us would equally love. I suppose I was hoping to find the kind of meal that would become an eternal memory...bites that you could smell and taste and feel when you simply think of them years later. Tall order? You betcha. Success? Absolutely. After weeks and weeks of pouring over articles and reviews and emails to friends, I crafted a very intense spreadsheet (don't worry...I only make spreadsheets where hedonistic pursuits are concerned) and finally decided on the 9-course meal with pairings at Senza. To say that the expectations were high would be an understatement. But boy, did they go above and beyond my lofty expectations. I believe that folks have broken down each of the dishes in a more concise way than I could, so I'll skip that part. Plus, a bit of surprise is never a bad thing. I will say that each and every dish is beautifully prepared and wonderfully paired. What struck me most was the textural experience. Layers upon layers of varying textures all coming together like a waltz or the climax of a classical piece of music. For instance, the Loup de Mer was a flaky white fish served with a creamy curry, crunchy carrots, a dusting of aromatic spice, a burst of acidity from individually plucked ruby red grapefruit pulp pieces, which meshed well with the pop of roe, all served on a bed of some earthy, spiced, crunchy deliciousness. I'm salivating just thinking about it. It's literally a party in your mouth, yet it all makes sense. And the pork belly. Man...the pork belly. I'm sure there was very real fear in my eyes when the gracious server took away my 4th course, as I was looking at what was to be 8 more courses - the next one being the pork belly - and I was already pretty stuffed. And then the pork belly came, I had one bite, and I was alive again. It was as though the stomach gods opened up and said, ""Yes, please, more, and thank you."" How something so rich could make you feel so light and buoyant, I don't know. But it did and I'm glad for it. My boyfriend and I ended up indulging in 11 courses/plates and each and every bite was a treat. I also commend the person who designed the wine pairings, which were really beautifully paired with the dishes, many of which were off the beaten path from what you might find elsewhere. I dig it. Like, a lot. Too often do the wines overwhelm the delicate flavors of these types of meals (or vice versa), but not this time. And I haven't even mentioned how wonderful and lovely everyone was that we interacted with here. No pretention whatsoever, which I always fear at this level of restaurant. These are salt of the earth people and their love for food and creating a wonderful dining experience really radiates. I commend each and every one of the Senza staff for putting together an exceptional meal. My boyfriend and I both fell in love with Chicago and look forward to making many more trips up north. We've already planned out the next few ""big"" restaurant visits, including 2- and 3- star joints. I'm sure we'll leave those spots excited, full, and pleased, although I have a feeling that we'll eventually say, ""...but it just wasn't as good as Senza."" Thank you again for an incredible meal and congratulations on your first Michelin star! It's very well-deserved.

I do have to say that it's a kinda stuffy restaurant for lakeview, but you already knew that with a set menu at $75 or $125 per person.  The food I have to say was excellent. My favorite was the duck, which I don't normally like. Be aware that the portions while presented very nicely are-- you guessed it, small.  The only downside to this place was that 3 of the dishes I had on the 5 course menu had some sort of solid food that was made into a white powder. Do it a few times and it seem inventive (and it's tasty), but when you do it too much then it's just gimmicky. Would I go back? I don't know,  if i'm spending that kinda money I wanna be in RiverNorth or somewhere with a nice view at least.",0.9488,0.828,0.138,0.034,0.5470588235294117

Hamachi and salmon - lightly seared on the side. Pure delight.  Oysters - a tingling of opposing flavors carried by a ham broth.  SCallops - I was disappointed they gave me just one. It was perfectly done - juicy but crisp on the outside. Blueberries completing the flavor. Onion soup - this was THE THING. duck proscuitto and mahon curado cheese with slivers of cauliflower. the cheese melted into the sweet creamy broth to make it heavenlike. Loup de mer - a teensy bit fishy but crisply done. a lot of cardamom crumble. something that i haven't had in quite a while. Pork belly - i forgot what it tasted like, but i remember I still loved it. Agnolotti - a little cheesy compared to the rest of the meal. Two small agnolottis filled with some kind of berry flavored cheesy compote. I could have done without it. Duck - once again, very nicely done. but not a fan of the matsutake. it did not pair well with the duck. desserts - oatmeal and chocolate - they were small and okay. but after the delightful meal, i was not going to crib about the dessert. The chef also offered us a surprise course of foie gras. We declined since I don't quite like it. But he did snd over a cheese dish with a fig jam filled finger roll. quite nice actually.

2013-11-03,5.0,"Amazing meal last night. We did the 9-course tasting menu with wine pairings. Each course was perfectly seasoned, creative and delicious. Not playful the way Moto is, perhaps (no food in the shape of cigars in an ashtray or a terrarium), but wonderful all the same. The Vidalia onion soup was orgasmically good, the seafood courses were all so so fresh, and that little loaf of bread was super yummy. The only minor misses for us were the duck course (somehow the dish didn't quite do it for us -- too much cumin?) and the wine pairing list was a bit heavy on whites, just as a personal preference. My husband doesn't eat fish or seafood so I talked to them the day before and they agreed to modify his menu. The chef really came through! My husband's favorite dish was actually a substitution, short ribs cooked sous vide to make them really juicy and tender.

2013-10-28,5.0,"Love the place. The food is solid!. We had the 9 course food tasting and we love all of them! Good flavor and well balanced. They are all good that it comes down to preferences what you like/ don't like e.g. duck dish was good but ok for me 'coz i don't like cumin. It was my fiancé's favorite dish.  They use those modern techniques such as black garlic powder and etc. However, it seems to be more purposeful and complementary to the dish. (There are so many restaurants using this kinda technique these days but some don't really add anything to the dish). fish amuse-bouche, onion soup, truffle ravioli were among the favorites. chocolate dessert was to die for.  I recommend do the 9 course tasting menu. You can't really tell what the dishes are based on the menu. They just highlight major ingredients in the menu. Most of our favorite dishes were dishes that we wouldn't order on our own by just reading the menu. Given how good the food is, we were surprised that we haven't really heard of the place before. (it's definitely better than some 1 michelin starred restaurants in chicago we've been to/ we didn't even give 5 star review to Alinea)  The restaurant opened in Aug'12.

2013-10-13,5.0,"Truly as good as it gets.  Senza actually redeemed my faith in tasting menus.  About 20 years ago, I had my first tasting menu as Charlie Trotters the weekend I got engaged.  It was probably the meal that most shaped my culinary instincts.  I returned to Chicago several times in the early '90s and had fantastic tasting menus.  I recently started a job in Chicago and treated myself to a couple of tasting menus and was disappointed.  I was not sure if it was one of these things where the memory is better than the reality or if the gold old days were better.  Senza showed me the memory was accurate and the problem with a lot of Chicago's current restaurants is they do not understand fully the tasting menu experience. I am not going to dwell on the actual courses, you can find it in almost any other review.  My takeaway was that all of the dishes were excellent.  What made this meal great was how it all came together.  The pacing of the meal kept building excitement for the next course.  The portion sizes were just enough to really experience each course but yearning for the next.  Also, the flavors came together well.  The meal almost told a story.  My problem with some of the other menus have tried recently is that the dishes are great but the chef just throws together his best dishes rather than having them work together.  At Senza, they truly work together to create a memorable experience (also why I did not want to discuss individual dishes, as that is not what it is about).  Each dish is effectively an ingredient in the experience. An additional positive was the portion size.  You may (at least initially) feel the individual dishes are too small but it works perfectly, you experience each dish and are completely stuffed by the end of the evening (keep in mind I had the larger tasting menu). I also wanted to call out the wine matching.  I found the price of it quite reasonable and felt it added to the overall enjoyment.   My one concern is that the night I went there were only 2-3 other tables filled.  Given our crowded some of Senza's competitors are, it really worries me that this great restaurant may not survive. I would be quite sad if I could not enjoy this menu again.",0.9929,0.791,0.155,0.053,0.4713752104377104

2013-09-28,5.0,"I am a loyal fan of NYC as the world's greatest city (or at least the US), so I've always a little skeptical of all the people who suddenly loved Chicago as if it were the new biggest fad in the US. However, this restaurant definitely bumped it up a couple big notches in my book! I had the good luck of having the chef offer me additional courses - so I was able to try everything on the menu!  In summary, I thought each dish showed incredible contract in both flavor and texture, providing a complexity and comprehensiveness that can be missing from dishes from the most esteemed restaurants.  It was definitely a treat, and the wait staff is superb, both very knowledgeable and courteous. Oysters - The oysters were very tasty, in a sauce with a vinegar zest and a big of hot sauce for contract.  It was not at all lacking in flavor, while maintaining the taste of oyster instead of disguising it, but yet still tasting clean and not overwhelming. Scallops - Delicious, there are two sauces to dip with, an onion caramel and a blueberry puree, which surprisingly did not clash but instead complemented each other. The scallop was tender and juicy, but seared on one side for a crisp texture. Also there were baby cippolini onions that were seared, again touching on the contrast theme. Butternut Squash soup - There was wonderful contrast in this dish as well, it was presented with a scoop of ice cream to contrast the heat of the soup. The soup was already a bit sweet, but the sweetness of the ice cream seemed to cancel it out a bit. Also there were thin crouton wafers and corn to add a crunch to the otherwise very smooth texture of the soup, another well contrasted dish. Ravioli - The ravioli was very good as well, parmesan crisps providing a big of cheesy flavor in a unique way (no standard ""do you want some cheese on that?"") and adding a crunchy texture to the smooth ravioli.  This is what I love about new american, it's innovative twists on tried and true flavor combinations. Foie gras - Last but not least, this was an experimental dish that the chef was looking to add onto the menu.  A slice of foie gras surrounded by a thin layer of soup, with poached pears and slices grapes and a bit of crumble to add texture.  This was by far my FAVORITE dish of the night, and I told the chef personally I hope they add it to the menu! Usually foie gras is a bit overwhelming, coming in giant chunks that you spread on bread, and is a bit salty, etc. This was the perfect size, and all the other pieces of the dish were there to contrast - the grapes were juicy and sweet to contrast and a perfect compliment. All in all, I loved this restaurant, what a delight to find this while visiting Chicago.  The only things I have to complain about are that parking isn't entirely a breeze, and that the bread was surprisingly not to my liking. The whipped butter was great and very light, and the bread was toasted in a way that it was very crispy, to provide contrast to the texture of the butter no doubt, however mine seemed to be a little overtoasted, tasting a bit of char. Some say you judge a restaurant based on the quality of their bread - in this case, I find that that would be an egregious error.

The pacing of the courses was excellent, and the wine came before the course every time which I really appreciated. LA restaurants are very sloppy about this sort of thing. Service here was top notch. Wine pairings are preposterously high quality for 50$. Heavy on French which is a very good play. I learned that the wine selection here is a collaborative effort with all the servers and the mixologist and chefs chiming in. Very cool, and it works well. We tried the bread which is excellent, can't believe there's no gluten. Preferred to almost any other bread I've had. Amuse raw fish little sip of soda Brilliant, spicy really got my taste buds going. Oysters Lovely preparation, and three oysters each which is very generous! Scallop I love the way the edamame pairs with the scallop. Blueberry so nice too. Wow. Onion soup This is taking it to another level. Duck prosciutto is just madness. Truffle actually plays a backseat to an olive oil ice cream that melts into the soup. I cannot describe accurately how utterly delicious this is. (Sea and cake comes on as if perfectly timed). What a meal so far! Salmon  The savory tour de force continues with a very nice piece of salmon (no one can accuse Senza of small portions btw) and tons of pumpernickel filling the air, the same way truffle aggressively dominated the nose on the previous dish. Squab with foie pb&j Very very tasty.  Angliotti Heavenly, and shocked its gluten free. Lamb The lamb is perfectly cooked, it's not too rare which is a mistake many decent places make (very rare lamb is too chewy). This was a very hearty portion. Oatmeal Yes! Nice combo of palate cleanser and sweet  Chocolate Really two desserts in one. All components were splendid. This was the best meal we had in Chicago. Significantly better than Moto and Nomi and Blackbird. Less than 2/3 the price of Moto (which I also loved).  Get the aqua panna, the tap is not serviceable (they shouldn't serve it unless they get a filter). Fortunately this was literally my only thing close to a complaint the rest of the night.

Here's what I got, with wine pairings (* = you can pick another option): Amuse Bouche - hamachi (yellowtail) - delicious and flavorful, came with a few sips of sake - the hamachi was so good that my friends and i joked that we wish it was an entree on the menu - we want mooooreeee! *Scallops ( yelp.com/biz_photos/senz… ) - my favorite! so buttery and delicious - practically melted in my mouth - the various sauces on the plate went very well with the scallops Parsnip Soup ( yelp.com/biz_photos/senz… ) - loved the lobster in it - creamy soups tend to get boring for me after awhile, but i loved this til the very last drop - dipped some of the bread in the soup [side note: the gluten-free bread was AMAZING - we actually asked for extra] *Rib Eye ( yelp.com/biz_photos/senz… ) - the portions were just right - meat was juicy and again i loved the various sauces, as well as the cherries Amuse Bouche - pastry that you dip in cream - perfectly flaky texture *Chocolate cake with sarsaparilla ice cream ( yelp.com/biz_photos/senz… ) - the cake was okay but the ice cream was amazing - i've never had sarsaparilla in ice cream before (only in soft drinks) but it was so so yummy. Also, I enjoyed all the wine pairings, especially the riesling with the scallops, and the wine with the chocolate dessert. I was totally satisfied by the end of the meal, but two of my guy friends still left a bit hungry... I'd say, if you have an average appetite, then you'll definitely feel full. Total with tax + tip came out to be a little over $100. I will definitely be back... maybe for the prix-frixe brunch so my wallet can hate me a little less!",0.998,0.744,0.229,0.026,0.567495238095238

2013-05-08,5.0,"First off, forget that it's gluten-free.  It's clearly incidental to what this place is doing. A better description is a fine dining focus on delicate flavors in a relaxed atmosphere.   Moving from course-to-course, it's also mediocrity-free, pretentiousness-free, pre-processed-free, and monotonous-free.  All of those ""-free""s are clearly more important. The food is the shining star.  I've been back several times and seen the menu evolve, each time staying close to fresh foods prepared with complexity but presented simply.  The wines tend towards modern European accessible and earthy vintages, but what really makes them stand out is how well they are paired to accompany.  I can imagine that the menu may have been inspired by the wines, because each plate has nuances that spring to the forefront because of the pairings.  The wine pairings that stood out to me the most were with the grilled lettuce/anchovy/podda cheese, essentially a deconstructed Caesar salad, and with the agnolotti morel mushroom-stuffed pasta with kumquat and huckleberry.  Wow!  Nothing makes me happier than a wine pairing that makes a dish's flavor explode. The service is very good and unobtrusive, with a friendly courteous staff that is very knowledgable.  Presentation is fantastic, unrushed, and with enough description to make you intrigued by most of the dishes before you taste or smell them. The atmosphere is casual and natural, so it's relaxed refined dining with a bit of what feels like a California influence.  It's like a step up from a very upscale casual lounge bar (without the noise) or a trendy American cafe.  I love the view into the kitchen and the counter staging area shared with the dining room.  Overall, the prep areas appear so shockingly small I don't understand how they can accomplish the variety of dishes that they do. A four-course prix fixe dinner with choices plus amuse-bouche and palate cleanser was $75 with wine pairings and ran nearly two and a half very unhurried hours, although they claimed it could be done in ninety minutes.  This food at that price is what pushes my review to five stars.  For the quality and complexity, Senza is a tremendous value in a city filled with $100+ uninspiring dining choices.  I have not had it, but the full eight-plus-course degustation menu at $150 with wine pairings looks like an equal bargain that bests the $250+ grand menu wine experiences in the city's most upscale establishments. Hats off to Noah Sandoval, the executive chef, and the entire staff.  My only complaint is having to ask twice for more bread, which was a delightful warm toasted soft sweet rice loaf.  I may be able to eat my weight in it.",0.9983,0.776,0.21,0.014,0.5260152740341419

2013-05-01,5.0,"Fantastic. Outstanding. Amazing.  I had been peering into Senza since before it opened, wanting to go desperately. The decor is beautiful and the menu enticing. Last night, I finally made my first visit and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We did the 9 course degustation with wine pairings. Before delving into specifics, I just have to say that $100 for the food and $50 for wine pairings is an incredible value for what you get. Many wine pairing options at restaurants like this are tiny pours, or glasses that are supposed to last multiple courses. You get a 1-2 oz. pour with every course. Every wine we had was delicious and some where of grapes I had never even heard of - what an adventure! The food is just wonderul. Every course was a delight - some more than others, but nothing disappointed. I have to say, my favorite was probably the Ribeye. It was full of flavor and unlike anything I've had in recent memory. The Humboldt Fog was delicious as well - one of my favorite cheeses made into ice cream...how could you go wrong? Service - Melanie was a delight. She knew about each wine in detail and was glad to bring out bottles that we loved so we could take pictures to remember them. After dinner was over, we stayed around for another glass and though the place was closing down, they were happy to accommodate.  Ambiance is very relaxed for a 9 course dinner, which I appreciate. Good music is playing at an appropriate volume level. The lighting is just right so you can see the food well - not too dark, not too bright.  I will be back and I cannot wait. Check out Senza - you won't be disappointed and you wouldn't even know it was gluten free. Oh yeah, the bread is delicious too.  Thank you, Senza for elevating the dining scene in Lakeview.

For drinks, I got the gin cocktail which was AMAZING. One of the best cocktails I've ever had in a long long time! Super glad our server recommended this over the vodka cocktail ;) We decided to go with the 4 course prix fixe and for amuse bouche we were given hamachi with a little sake. The hamachi was good, but slightly salty For the first course I got the scallops while bf got the grilled lettuce. I really enjoyed my scallops and while the grilled lettuce was good, it wasn't that exceptional. The parsnip soup for the second course was good, and someone who especially enjoys carrot/parsnip would love it. I'm not a big carrot fan myself, but still liked the soup. For the third course, I got the halibut while bf got the pork belly. I was looking forward to the barramundi, but the halibut was very good too! But oh the bf's pork belly was simply out of the world. It was thaaaat good (and I'm not that big of a pork belly fan!) For dessert, we each got different ones and shared. I got the milk chocolate and bf got the oatmeal. Milk chocolate was very good again, but the oatmeal dessert was DIVINE!!! Get it and you will have no regrets, really. The moscato that is paired with it is amazing too if you like dessert wines. Oh, the only thing that we did not enjoy that much was the gluten free bread... I can't really compare it to other gluten free breads given that I've never had them in my life, but it just tasted weird to us.. There was a slightly off texture too. But based off other reviews, its supposed to be a really good gluten free bread! oh well.. Overall, everything was very good! Loved that the dress code is casual so no need to dress up too much!

2013-04-20,5.0,"Visiting this place with my boyfriend ended up being the highlight of my week! Absolutely everything about this place was perfect. We felt it presented great value and a true dining experience. Welcome to our neighborhood Senza! Food & Wine Chef Noah Sandoval doesn't let you down! Every single course served to us was a solid, well put together dish; served at the right temperature and elegantly plated (the china is selected to enhance the appearance of each course!) Each dish contained very special ingredients and unexpected combination of flavors, daring but well balanced. Of course we had our favorites and the ultimate winners were the Parsnip Soup (with lobster and caviar), the Foie Gras Crème Brûlée (yes together), the Rib Eye served with crusted cheese thins, mushroom stuffed pasta and dried citrus flakes  and the Oatmeal Desert (pure paradise with pine nuts) Wine parings were amazing (I agree with Zach) Gewürztraminer paired amazingly well with the soup and Cab Franc made a perfect paring for the Rib Eye course, all the rest of the wine pairings were very interesting. A few were even replaced at my request:) A nice touch was their signature bread, fresh and soft with delicious golden crust it had a subtle corn flavor and comes out perfectly complemented by whipped honey butter.    Atmosphere & Service The decor is very trendy and has polished feel, but not stuffy. In fact everything is very functional, the tables are spacious and chairs are very comfortable - which is very important when you sign up for 9 courses!  I thought the designer Karen Harold did a fine job. Considering the Lakeview location of this restaurant, she captured the ""neighborhoody"" feel and I suspect the fabric covered ceiling and textured wallpaper control the noise. We were there on a very busy night and didn't have any trouble catching up and flirting across the table:)   Of course as a foodie, I always appreciate knowable and passionate staff and Senza has plenty of that! Everyone that came out to our table knew everything about what we were having. Zach & Kara who were our leading waiters played a huge role in the dining experience.  They explained each course with a special pride and even told us a little history behind the dishes, treating chef's creations as art, which they in deed were.

2013-04-15,5.0,"Dying. Dead. Even Deader.  This place killed me with insane food on Friday - in the best possible way.  Just from cooking for myself, I know gluten free food can be delightful. You don't need wheat to make food good. And, in all honesty, if you took someone to Senza and didn't tell them it was entirely gluten free, they wouldn't even think to ask. It was that good. They actually don't even allow gluten IN THE BUILDING. How great is that?  We did the four course menu. And by four course, I mean it was actually 6 courses (with an amuse and an intermediate course). The four course 4 menu is 50/pp. I started with a strawberry rhubarb vodka drink and we perused the menu. Gah. The choices.  Our amuse was a bite of hamachi. There was a lot of flavors going on, so I'm not sure what all was there, but it was delightful. For our app, I chose the scallops and my husband chose the oysters. The scallops were mindblowing. There were three tiny scallops with blueberries and ramps. My description doesn't do it justice. The next course was the parsnip soup with lobster and caviar. So creamy and the flavors were so balanced.  For our mains, I chose the pork belly with strawberry, carrot and watercress and my husband chose the barramundi. Best pork belly ever. It was sweet, salty and savory at the same time. Delightful. The intermediate course was goat cheese ice cream with GF graham cracker crumble. It kind of tasted like cheesecake. It was awesome. For dessert I had a milk chocolate mousse with nut butter (it was like a totally insane candy bar, OMG) and my husband got the ""oatmeal"", which was a mishmash of delightful ingredients.

2013-03-26,4.0,"My fiancé and I went to Senza for his birthday dinner and we had a wonderful experience. We had the 9 course menu for $100 which is a fabulous price for a gourmet experience.  Each course was beautifully presented, but I am not surprised considering the resume of Chef Noah Sandoval. He has worked under Michael Carlson of Schwa as well as Takashi of Takashi.     The parsnip soup was a delightful surprise, as well as the pork belly that was paired with strawberry. If you can't resist black truffle, the Tagliatelle pasta with artichokes was a standout course....Oh, and of course the Foie gras that was served in a similar way as crème brulee. The portions were the typical fine dining size; however, I think what sets this place apart from other prie fix menus is they offer bread at the table. The bread was one of the best and most unique we have ever had (also gluten free). Even better was the fact that they offered us another loaf after we inhaled the first. It had a sweet and crispy crust and paired perfectly with whipped honey butter. It could have even been eaten as a dessert.  You can even order this bread along with other bakery items in the mornings which we will be doing in the near future.   The service was outstanding. It seemed as if the staff had taken an etiquette class on synchronized serving.  As soon as I stood up to find the bathroom, the Maitre D. was leading the way. A person at the table next to us dropped some silverware and it seemed like the waiter couldn't have gotten there any faster than if he took a zip line. Upon coming back from the bathroom each time was a new folded napkin. It's rare to get service this professional unless you are dining somewhere that Chicago Magazine has given $$$$.  My fiancé ordered a cocktail that he didn't particularly care for and our waitress was more than willing to take it back and replace it with something else., which ended up being really good. I liked it more than my drink.   Before I wrap up I must touch lightly on the décor. The dining room has a very clean and contemporary vibe.  It was designed by Karen Harold whose accolades include Girl and the Goat and GT Fish & Oyster.  According to Senza's website the dining room features a ""unique blend of natural, hand finished wood, warming textures, and modern art"".

2013-03-18,5.0,"The next night I had reservations at Senza, it was a little hard for me to find as the sign for the place doesn't exactly jump out at you.  I must have driven past it twice while looking for it and walked past it once before calling the place and almost immediately finding it.  It was one of those moments where as soon as she picked up the phone I found it.  I wanted to do the wine pairings with their menu, but they had a Bourbon cocktail with mint and Thai chilies that I just couldn't resist.  I sat for a bit with the Bourbon drink.  It started off very strong and bold and as the ice melted, it would get a more subtle and mellow minty flavor.  It was probably one of the better drinks I've had in a while and I really wish this place had a bar because the drinks were phenomenal.  For the first course was this very rich and buttery duck confit with ravioli.  The huckleberries brightened up the dish and it was well balanced with the pea tendrils that were a little bit spicy and almost became the star of the dish.   The saffron was used perfectly to give delicate floral background notes without overpowering into a potpourri like nightmare. Next up was the Parsnip Soup.  It was pureed to a magical velvety texture and the rich lobster was a good addition.  I almost thought that it wouldn't work and the progression  of the dishes would have been a bit off and the parsnip soup should have been served first.  I was proved wrong though.  After the richness of the ravioli, I wanted something to kind of brighten up the palate again and the pear that was present in the puree did just the trick.  The rich and delicate lobster kept things from getting overpoweringly light and was very satisfying.  Then there was a moment of culinary awesomeness as I was sent out some free fois gras.  I had only had fois gras a couple of times before and I usually stay away from it because of the treatment of the geese.  That being said, you could almost overlook the fact that those geese are force fed corn after you taste the rich and delicate lightness of this fois gras.  There is a a fine line between rich and tasty and greasy and this dish did a tap dance around that line like Sammy Davis Jr.  It pushed the boundaries of fattiness and was absolutely devine.  Combined with that custard topped with a brulee of sugar and you are blessed with that divine combination of salty and sweet.  It is pretty ironic that the best dish I enjoyed during restaurant week was free, but this one offered everything, from the variations of texture from the soft delicate fois gras ascending the scale to the crunchy caramel corn.  I have to admit, I am a little biased towards loving it simply because it has one of my favorite things in the world (caramel), but that doesn't take away from the fact that it was a a really good dish. Given the choices between scallop, tagllatelle, and pork belly for the main course, it was a pretty easy pick for me.  Not to say that I don't like scallops or pasta, but nothing beats pork belly.  Almost nothing ever.  I have a friend who hates strawberries and I sometimes think that he is a little evil on the inside.  That being said I wish the pork belly came with much more of the compressed strawberries.  Senza, seems to play a lot with using sweetness throughout their savory courses and I can't deny that it is a winning strategy.  Combining the pork belly with that absolutely divine maple creme fraiche was genius.  You get earthiness from the watercress and carrot.  A little bit of tartness from the strawberries.  I only have a couple of complaints about this dish, one is I wish there was tons more compressed strawberries on the plate, probably twice as much.   Also, one of the strawberries was unexpectedly extremely tart, though the rest were very tasty. I wasn't surprised that since there was so many sweet elements in their savory dishes, that a unexpected savory element was added to the the dessert.  The miso and rosemary was that little extra tasty something that makes you go hmmm, what is that.  The tart raspberries were an absolute triumph and attention was still kept to balance of texture by pairing the light airy mousse with a crunchy pumpkin seed crisp.  I'm not that big of a chocolate fan but the little bit of cacao powder was appreciated.  The coffee should have come with one of those McDonald's warnings.  Seriously I could have sued them, it came out boiling hot.  I couldn't pass on the rum cocktail because it had apples and caramel in it.  It was a hit  for me because of the almost excessive foaminess.  Overall I had a good meal at Senza, the only downside would be the incredibly loud table that was next to me.  The decor is definitely set up to give off a romantic vibe.",0.9995,0.755,0.208,0.037,0.6092099567099567

2013-03-03,5.0,"This is my first yelp review.  We went for our anniversary and had a wonderful time.  Food was fantastic (and neither of us are gluten free), ambience was perfect (nice buzz and energy but still quiet enough for us to talk easily), and service was friendly and good.  I loved every course and was full by the end.  My husband, who can be a glutton, loved the food too but was a tad bit  hungry despite eating half of my entree. To be fair, we had the four course, not the nine course tasting, and he does weigh 225 # or so he says.  They have intimate tables for two with side by side seating which added to the romance factor, although that means if you look ahead, you may be staring down at other people eating directly in front of you; this could be considered free entertainment except the couple in front of us didn't say a word to each other the entire time.  Several staff wished us a happy anniversary and they did give us a small glass of sparkling wine which was a thoughtful touch.  We had the bourbon cocktails which were also delicious.",0.9959,0.747,0.253,0.0,0.6207341269841271
2013-02-17,1.0,"Oh Senza!  You showed such great promise.  You've got the right look, the right idea but whoever is managing you needs to be shown the door.  It is rare for me to review so highly at first and have to update with such a low score. I went for brunch today...sat down and saw the menu was only price fix.  $24.00.  I scanned the items and nothing, I mean nothing, looked good.  My friend and I expected a normal ala carte menu so I called her and she said it was not what she was looking for.  I had to leave!   After a coffee and a side, the price would have been more, per person, that we paid in total down the street for three courses and 2 coffees.  BTW, the place we ended up had a 30 minute wait.  It was packed.  I think on a Sunday in Lincoln Park, this is pretty standard issue stuff.  You should be packed too, if you were doing it right you would be. In regards to the brunch menu, there was nothing on option 1 even remotely breakfast-y.  The great thing about brunch is one person can go with breakfast options while the other might go with lunch options.  Perhaps, if you had 2 breakfast items in each category and 2 lunch type options, I might consider coming again. Overall, you need to re-think this price fix thing.  I'd have been thrilled with a breakfast sandwich, maybe the awesome beignets to split and a fancy, $5-$6 coffee.  Isn't $15 per person better than $0?",0.9823,0.854,0.12,0.026,0.540027924750147

The bad: you'll enjoy the food... but there isn't a whole lot of it.  I was barely satiated at the end of the meal, and it'll set you back $24 without tax or tip added in yet.

2013-02-07,5.0,"VERY impressive dinner at Senza; I had been spying Senza for a couple of months now and was reluctant on pulling the trigger despite the consistently excellent reviews as I was unsure if this was a great restaurant for people on a gluten free diet (all the food, beverages, even bread at Senza is gluten free) or if this was simply a great restaurant. Anybody else who has been reticent to try Senza because of the gluten free menu, please make a reservation: If they did not advertise as being gluten free one would never know! This is Michelin star quality food being served in a nice, cozy space with extremely friendly staff at a moderate price point.  Senza currently features two frequently changing menus; a four course prix fixe for $50 (all but one course have two to three choices) and a nine course tasting menu for $100. Optional wine pairings run $25 and $50 respectively. With 24 hours notice they will make changes to the menu to accommodate dietary restrictions or aversions. Both menus include an amuse bouche and bread service.  My friend and I opted for the four course prix fixe with pairings and each course (and the amuse of Hamachi with dashi foam) were excellent in presentation, creativity and taste. Even the bread was delicious; we ate about half the bread on it's own and used the other half to dip into the the lovely parsnip soup (poured over lobster, caviar, pear and celery) as well as the sauce from the amuse and appetizer. My appetizer consisted of some really pleasant duck confit ravioli and for my entree I enjoyed the pork belly which had a nice crispy exterior and moist interior and had some fun accompaniments with a sweet component to balance the saltiness of the pork. Dessert did not disappoint; I ordered the spiked apple cider - apple cider sorbet with a hint of rum served with gingerbread crisps. Perhaps my only complaint was I left just a tad hungry (but admittedly I do have a larger than normal appetite).  Beverage pairings were spot on and at $25 quite a bargain. The amuse bouche was served with a couple of sips of sake, the three savory courses with rather generous pours of wine (probably close to four ounce pours) and my dessert came with a small glass of Crispin cider (my favorite hard cider). After dinner we enjoyed a bourbon cocktail that had mint leaves frozen into the ice cubes (gradually changing the taste profile), ginger beer and Mexican chilies to add a pleasant kick to the aftertaste; this was really good.  One of the largest complaints about Senza was that much of the seating was picnic style benches that people found a bit uncomfortable. Senza listened to this concern as just today they made renovations; out are the picnic benches and in are elegant hardwood tables providing a more comfortable and upscale ambiance. A slate centerpiece sits atop the table with a candle and some cool looking flowers; modern decor adorns the walls. Off to the side are cozy tables for two where you sit side-by-side on cushions atop a bench and in the front are a handful of bar style seats looking out onto Broadway Street. When full Senza is a bit on the loud side, but not to an extent as to become unpleasant.  While the food is on par with some of Chicago's one Michelin starred venues, service is not as refined but makes up for this in the friendliness and attentiveness. Senza has a nice blend of casual fine dining with a neighborhood vibe. I had such a delicious and enjoyable meal (at an extremely reasonable price) that I will certainly be returning to Senza soon. Owner Susan McMillan and executive chef Noah Sandoval (formerly of Schwa) really have something special here and this is one of Chicago's best values. Addendum: Had so much fun at dinner the other night that I returned for brunch today and loved it as much as the dinner! Brunch is more of a hearty, lunch style meal at Senza and features three courses (appetizer, entree and dessert) with different choices for each course for $24 per/person; similar concept to brunch at North Pond. A few optional sides are available as well as great coffee and some adult beverages (I opted for the Bloody Mary). There is also an a la carte option if one wants a smaller, less expensive brunch. The food was beautifully plated and tasted outstanding; service was once again extremely warm and friendly. Such a lovely enjoyable brunch!",0.9996,0.736,0.229,0.035,0.5989355742296919

The cocktails we had were great. I suggest trying the Rum and the Brandy, both very good and very big pours. We went with the 9 course tasting menu and I loved every dish except one, and that was the cheese dish. The only reason I didn't like it was that I forgot there was a cheese dish and the plate looked like a dessert. I was expecting sweet and a big hunk of stinky cheese hit my palate. Once I realized what was going on, I was ok with it. But it was quite a surprise. My favorite dish would have to be the seared foie gras with creme brulee. So decadent and rich with a nice hearty protein from the foie gras. Would happily eat nine courses of just that. I also had no idea that the place was gluten-free until two minutes before arriving. I checked in on Foursquare and was informed. If this is what gluten-free food can taste like, then we are ok people. Nothing to worry about. Even the bread and butter were excellent.

My dining partner, who, I think, actually prefers MORE gluten, loved the food as well.  The bread was amazing. We ate two loafs. Don't judge, it's just a huge treat to have moist, tasty bread. We ate the soup, tagliatelle, duck confit (I don't even know what that is), scallops, roasted lettuce salad, and each of the deserts and none of the plates disappointed.  I was a bit bummed that I couldn't pick and choose my food, but I think being ""forced"" to be adventurous was more fun and more rewarding.

Every last thing down to dessert was swooned over by the whole table (the chocolate was especially yummy), and even my pickier friend was won over by some very unusual food combinations. We came back for the prix-fixe brunch recently- great coffee, and the bacon is an absolute must-have. I did get the wrong dish at one point, but since the rest of us had all ordered the same things except for that particular one I'm sure it was easy to mix up.

Grilled lettuce - basically a deconstructed caesar salad. a lot of people think deconstruction is a dumb food trend but I think it's great!  This dish is a great example of it - their take on a caeser is amazing. plus it contained one of my favorite items in the whole meal: balsamic caviar!  I'm not sure if this exists outside of Senza - but I want a whole jar of this stuff. Parsnip soup - I would never think of putting together parsnip, apple, and lobster - but it worked together so well!  it was flavorful and not too rich or heavy. Scallops with foie gras - I was nervous in selecting this because I have an aversion to the taste of foie gras, or maybe just liver in general. I'm not sure what made me give it another chance this time, but I'm glad I did!  it wasn't overpowering and worked well with the rest of the dish. White chocolate dessert - probably my least favorite dish, but I have a bias (and it still wasn't a bad dish). white chocolate is an offensive substance to me. (why is called chocolate?! it's fat from a cocoa bean.  you don't take a piece of meat and refer to the fat around it as white meat, why is it okay to do it with chocolate?!).  after my surprise success with foie gras, i gave it a chance.  it was still white chocolate - a sickeningly sweet blob of fat.  the ingredients around it made it palatable.

The ambiance was cozy, warm, and inviting, while still being modern and chic. One of the features I loved was the side-by-side seating in the ""booths"" or, well, tables against the wall, with cushions and a great view of the dining room. The staff were beyond friendly, polite, and professional.  The hostess sat us, without a reservation (on a Wednesday, I'd call ahead for weekend nights), and was attentive all night. I actually asked her what her involvement was (wife of the head chef) because of the pure joy she had all night. I mean, it was just shining out of her, it really made the place feel welcoming. Okay, the food.  Four or nine course tasting menu's, with appropriately prices wine pairings. We chose the four, and went off of the drink menu, which had a handful of reds, whites, a few sparkling, two beers, and five cocktails (done in the ""by liquor"" style). I opted for the Bourbon which was spicy, and not too sweet.  It was a well made cocktail, but I may have toned back the sweetness by a very tiny amount, I think it came from the ginger beer. Not enough to really be an issue, but I'm looking for minor things to pick at for Senza (not many). The scallops (I dislike scallops) were cooked VERY well, and the parsnip soup had a wonderful flavor, the curry really tying it together. The ""everything Gnocchi"" were melt-in-your-mouth good, with an outstandingly poached egg (well done scallops AND eggs in two courses...wow).  Honestly, I could have just eaten a whole plate of those gnocchi, alone. She had the barramundi, which again, I don't care for the flavor of the fish, but it was done very well.  I had the pork belly, and I'll admit it was a LITTLE dry. Not super noticeable, but again, I'm reaching for things to pick at here.  Also, the carrot cake had a mite too much cardamom, it was a little overpowering. Ended with the Robiloa which was ""grown up sweet,"" aka, just the right amount. The white chocolate was dangerous, rich, smooth, creamy. Fantastic.  Both the dining room and restrooms were spotless.

Upon entering, I was a little surprised how small the place was, but after a few minutes I realized that the intimate setting was what made the Senza experience that much better. It doesn't get too loud, but doesn't get too quiet either. The atmosphere is perfect for a nice dinner and good conversation. I loved the decor as well, simple and refined. Onto the food. They have tasting menus, but we decided to go Ala Carte. But before I delve into the first dish, I have to reveal a little surprise. An Amuse Bouche! It was so delicious. I believe it was seared tuna, but all I know is that it was a tasty little surprise. Now onto the first dish. We started off with Grilled Little Gem Lettuce, with anchovy, tomato, caper, crouton. I could eat this salad/dish everyday if the chefs in the back would just come to my house and be my personal chef. This dish was heavenly even thought I first saw the anchovy and nearly died. But after sucking it up, I realized anchovies are pretty tasty especially combined with the dressing/sauce. Next we tried the Gniocchi which was divine. It's so easy to forget everything is gluten free! (oops.... even I almost forgot while writing this post!) The duck egg is definitely a nice treat to go with the gniocchi. We added a second one so we could split the dish.  But honestly my favorite part of the meal was the entree. I've never had nor heard of Barramundi. But now I definitely know I wish it wasn't hiding from me all this time. To me the dish was delightful and not too heavy, which I am sure the Lamb Loin my friend had would have been for me that  night (thought that is definitely not to say it wasn't delicious because the bite I had was divine).  Though I absolutely loved the dishes this time around, next time I'll spring for the tasting menu.  I decided on a dessert though my friend isn't really a dessert guy. We decided on a prosecco wine and I ordered the sorbet which I believe this time around was an Apple Cider sorbet. Very delicious, though I ended up eating most of it!

I haven't had food this good in quite some time, where the appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all equally good. Senza means ""without"" in Italian, and speaks to the fact that the restaurant is gluten-free. At first, I was a little leery about gluten free b/c I thought that the taste would be sacrificed, but it is completely the opposite. All of my food had fun and surprising bursts of flavor and texture. They sent out this amuse bouche, which had this flaky crust with a piece of delicate fish in the middle with an Asian sauce. It was the perfect bite with a fun texture and flavor.   From the the pillowy-soft gnocchi with delectable onions (I actually had to get 2 orders of the gnocchi b/c it was that good) to the layer of ginger at the bottom of my dessert, I was amazed with every bite. I had the Barramundi, which was a delicious white fish w/pecans and black garlic. One of my friends got the Grilled Little Gem lettuce salad, and the lettuce was literally grilled and had a fantastic smoky flavor. Grilled salad was new to us all, and we were all eating the salad off of her plate. One of my favorite items was the crème brulee, which had a sweet and salty profile and reminded me of caramel corn. I have never had crème brulee like this - it was playful and delicious.  Senza has a trendy décor, yet it was much smaller than I had expected. Definitely make reservations. They have some tables on the side of the room that are perfect for 2 people, and we saw a few dates in progress, so definitely consider Senza for a date. I would say that Senza is one of the best restaurants that I have dined at in 2012 - no joke. I may get the tasting menu the next time I go.",0.9988,0.728,0.265,0.007,0.48931203931203954
2012-12-16,5.0,"Went to Senza last night for dinner and I will just say that I was floored by the food. Absolutely on-point execution, with amazing flavors and perfect ingredient pairings I am still thinking about. I should state that no one in our party has celiac disease, we just wanted an upscale, nice dinner out, while being near our place. This experience was beyond any of our expectations. The scallops were perfectly cooked, melting in my mouth with a combination of accompanying flavors I cannot describe other than incredible. I had the baramundi as my entree, which again, was nothing less than amazing. The black garlic sauce brushed on the plate underneath the fish, combined with perfectly sauteed mushrooms and a sweetness from what I realized came from grapes , was extraordinary. If you enjoy a white, flaky fish, similar to grouper, definitely get this!  With that said, you can't go wrong with anything, as another in our party ordered the Tagliatelle and she said that it was one of the best dishes she has had in Chicago. I should preface that she loves pasta and any carbohydrate for that matter, and she could not tell any difference with it being gluten-free.  She didn't want to share, it was so good, but I was blown away by combination of flavors brought by the melt in your mouth noodles and blend of tomatoes, crimini mushrooms, artichokes with a light and creamy sauce. My boyfriend ordered the lamb loin, which was cooked perfectly, sous-vide style, and included 2 beautiful pieces of loin as well as a section of lamb belly served in between.  The only thing that made me consider 4 stars, is due to the wine list. It leans towards quite a few reislings and pinot gris, so as chardonnay drinkers, we went with an average French Burgundy, as the only other option was Decoy.  I cannot say more positive things of Senza and can't wait to go back!",0.9873,0.836,0.139,0.025,0.5782034632034634

2012-12-12,4.0,"I am not one for fine dining. When I do step into a restaurant where people are happy to serve me, it catches me off guard. Same goes for a menu that offers only 8-9 dishes served for the evening. I'm intimidated and feel I'm backed into a corner and forced to choose something I am not so excited to taste. I guess you could conclude that I am out of my element when it comes places like this. But don't think this is a bad review by any means (I gave it 4 stars, you dumby!) The room itself is very small but it is quiet and relaxing. The decor suits the environment you are in and it seems very inviting. No intimidation, you are treated like a person. When I say treated like a person, I mean your coat is put away for you and you gain this sense that you are being taken care of purely out of enjoyment. It's great and very comforting. I could not understand the menu, I'm new to these places, okay?! Our waitress, who was more than willing to explain it, did a wonderful job breaking it down and explaining what was being offered for the evening. After perusing the foreign document, my date and I finally decided. Our main courses were the NY strip, for me, and the Tagliatelle for my date. But before indulging and diving right into our main course we got a taste of an Apple and Parsnip soup with pomegranates and lobster. It was fantastic and really warmed my date and I up for our coming entrees.  Another fantastic plate that we had the chance to try consisted of Barramundi and a garlic type sauce. This was my favorite of the night, so far. The taste was out of this world and being a Cod fish lover, this was right up my alley. Finally the entrees came and they lived up to the quality and presentation of the previous dishes that we had the pleasure of trying. The strips were cooked perfectly and the sauce that came dressed on it was more than fitting. Dessert time came and we ordered a Spiked Apple Sorbet but that was not all that was brought to the table. The kitchen also gave us a type of sponge cake with rice krispy pieces as well as a coconut sorbet. The sorbet gods were looking over us tonight. It was a fantastic end to a fantastic dining experience. The food, the employees, and the atmosphere all funnel into one outstanding and enjoyable experience. All in all, this place was fantastic and really makes me want to break out of my bubble of bar food and hamburger joints. It pays to break out of your element because you may stumble across a place such as Senza. The only thing though, yes there is a downside, is the chairs. I hope they fill the dining room with new chairs because they are extremely uncomfortable. Comfort is important, I think, when eating. Especially when eating! No matter where. When the new chairs come in and I test them for maximum comfort, this place will get 5 stars from me and I will print this review off, tear the section out regarding the chairs, and eat it. I promise.  Eat here. It is fantastic. Oh, and save room for bread.",0.9991,0.738,0.223,0.039,0.614226676101676
2012-12-04,5.0,"I don't think I could say enough good things about Senza!  Starting from the fantastic service, the attention to detail, fabulous recommendations and overall quality and taste of the scrumptious food we ate tonight, I have to admit, it's DANGEROUS that I live down the street! Where to begin?  The wine was perfection.  The pumpkin/lobster/curry soup was unlike anything I had ever tried before...and it was absolutely amazing.  The crunch of the pumpkin seeds and the size and flavor of the lobster combined with the curry was excellent.  I'm stuffed right now, and my mouth is watering just thinking about the soup! I had the artichoke pasta with tomatoes and the fiancé had the steak.  Both were to die for.  I would argue the gluten free noodles I had were even better than regular whole wheat noodles we're all used to.  The truffle sauce was perfect; the pickled blackberries on my fiance's steak were so unique and perfectly balanced with everything else on his plate; including the parsnips! We had the gingerbread/apple ice cream and a chocolate cake thing for desert, perfectly paired with drinks that I couldn't even dream up if I tried.  Like I sad, it's dangerous that we live down the street.  I can't wait to see what their brunch will be like.  If it's anything like the quality and ingenuity of the downright delicious meals we ate tonight, I'll be the first one there.  BRAVO!!",0.9908,0.729,0.206,0.065,0.6547595566826335

2012-11-25,5.0,"I can totally see why people love this place so much and the 5 star reviews were definitely well deserved. Ambiance: I think the restaurant bodes a fairly relaxed atmosphere with picnic style tables and bunches.  Except these tables were coated over with shiny white paint.  So the style is casual elegant. Bread: The bread that we were served must have been made from the tapioca flour (my guess given the texture).  It came out warm and the texture was a little on the chewy side.  It was reminds me of the Brazilian cheese bread except without the cheese. AMUSE BOUCHE: When we were served our amuse, I knew the evening would be off to a great start.  Our amuse came in a glass that had foam, very molecular gastronomy.  It was tuna in dashi broth.  And what can I say other than it was quite delicious.   PARSNIP AND APPLE SOUP: The soup comes in a wide rimmed bowl that had 3 pieces of lobster, one each on the rim and one in the center of the bowl along with the pomegranates and whatnot.  It was beautifully presented and the broth is poured into your bowl tableside.  It was still a savory soup  with occasional notes of sweetness as you bit into the celery puree/pomegranates/pumpkin. WHITEFISH: This fish was perfectly cooked.  The meat was tender and the skin was crispy.  The pork belly melts in your mouth.  My favorite must have been the tiny piece of the smoked silken tofu.  Dashi broth had strong flavors of the bonito flakes.   SQUAB: The squab that I've had was cooked medium.  I don't recall how it was cooked here but according to my dining companion, it was cooked ""delicious.""  I must say, I have to agree.  Usually, the bird is a little gamey for me and it still had the gaminess to it, but it was good.  The chicken liver mousse also was good and not overpowering. FOIE GRAS: The foie was perfectly seared and melt into your mouth good fattiness.  It'd be pretty hard to mess up the foie.  The contrasting flavors of the strawberry definitely cuts the richness of the foie.  Very well balance flavors. I didn't try the lamb loin or the strip but my dining companions said that they were quite good. CHOCOLATE CREMEUX: I think it was good but not as great as the savory dishes.  It was basically chocolate ganache with some cocoa nibs. It had a tiny s'more on top so the presentation was pretty good.   BRANDY: The brandy with the cardamom was recommended by our server.  I definitely like sweet cocktails and this one hits the spot. Service: Service of the restaurant was great.  They came over repeatedly to make sure that our water glasses were filled.  They were friendly without being overbearing.   Overall: I'd definitely recommend Senza to anyone who wants to dine at a great restaurant.  It would make a nice casual date (provided that you want to spend the money).",0.999,0.745,0.238,0.017,0.6122222222222222
2012-11-18,4.0,"My dear friend has celiac disease, so when she found a place that had an entirely gluten free menu, I knew we'd have to go try it - and I'm so glad we did. The breakfast/lunch menu is a little sparse (the dinner menu seems to offer much more variety), but everything on it sounds delicious.  We ordered the beignets rolled in cinnamon sugar to split, my two brunchmates ordered the English muffin sandwich (with tarragon aioli!) and I got the ""everything"" gnocchi with shiitake ""bacon,"" egg, ricotta, and arugula. We each order a latte, which you can customize with your choice of milks (almond milk, yay!) and flavors. We were tempted by the baked goods near the register, but resisted. The food came to our table promptly and the presentation could not have been more beautiful - even my friend's plain old fruit salad looked damn near artisan. My gnocchi was incredible - soft, a little chewy, adorned with sesame and sitting in creamy ricotta. The egg just adds a little richness and the arugula cuts all the gluttony with a little sharp green taste. It was heaven. Similarly, the beignets are a doughy, sweet delight. The exact texture you want them to be, rolled in a generous amount of cinnamon sugar, with fresh berries on the side. The English muffin looks handcrafted, with a crisp toasty texture and a generous portion of veggie cream cheese on the side. My favorite part of this is that my gluten free meal was chock full of bread-type items - my friend was delighted at all of the options she had to safely enjoy. I was delighted that I didn't feel like I was having a meal full of substitutions and replacements - the food stood on its own, without having to say ""yeah, it's good for gluten free food."" My only tiny picky thing is that the portions are very, very small. I realize this is supposed to be a fancier, higher end gluten free dining experience, but I don't want to leave brunch hungry, which I kinda did.",0.9983,0.729,0.248,0.022,0.5809465737514519
2012-11-17,5.0,"If you are gluten-free or have a friend that is, go to Senza. Starting with the basics.  Senza is the Italian conjunction for the word ""without"" with the latin root of absentia or ""absent.""  As in absent of gluten.  It can also mean ""great"" as an interjection if you are Slavic.  I find both of these definitions to be accurate descriptions.   Senza is actually 2 restaurants.  The first is the dinner service and staff run by Chef Noah Sandoval.  The second is a brunch service and staff, which is run by someone else.  Both services are 100% gluten-free. When you first walk in, the decor is an odd mix of modern, contemporary, urban, and shabby?  I think they sell gluten-free products behind the counter and the books might also be for sale.  The breakfast service is counter service which can be bit odd after having been waited on the night before.  I've found the decor and service disjointedness to be jarring each time, but honestly, the food is the reason we go and will keep coming back.  They are also brand new, so they might find a single identity by the time you read this. Michael Carlson was Grant Achatz first hire at Trio.  Chef Noah Sandoval was Sous Chef for Michael Carlson. I don't know anything about the morning chef. Senza dinner service: Chef Noah Sandoval's menu, use of molecular gastronomy for presentation, and of round things that I chase around my plate trying to stab remind me previous experiences I've had with Chef Grant Achatz's dishes. The first night opened we went for the grand tasting with wine pairing.  1. It was delicious.  2. It was an adventure.  3. It was all gluten-free. We have since been back during the week for single dishes.  Everything is perfectly cooked and portioned for someone with self control.  I lack self control.  We usually order at least 3 courses each and share them.  I would recommend you try everything.  Everything on the menu is really good.  The only thing I don't love is the side bread... but I seem to eat a lot of it anyways. If you have any additional food issues, they will work around them. Senza breakfast service: They have doughnuts.  Not like crappy Jewel freezer gluten-free doughnuts and not weird flour Roses doughnuts... like walked into a regular doughnut store and I got some legit doughnuts kinda doughnuts...  They call them beignets, but they are doughnut holes with a highfalutin french name.  Fresh out of the frier, they are delicious and a bit hot.

2012-11-08,4.0,"I took my dinner club here for our 1 year anniversary and it didn't disappoint! I still think they have room for improvement but rae very close to being a 5-star! Though, I have to admit, I'm a little suspicious of this being a new opening 5-star rating and SO many of the reviews coming from people that have less than 10 overall reviews.... We did the 5-course tasting - reasonably priced at $75 and $25 for the wine pairing. Food was gorgeously plated and delicious with the layered flavors. Amuse - it did just what it was supposed to do, awaken the palette and leave you wanting more! One of my favs of the night, fish was so tasty with bursts of the basil and rounded by the dashi foam. Soup - Lobster perfectly cooked, the pumkin seed and pomegranate offered great texture to the soup. Really well done and the pairing was perfect. Round but quick finish, didn't linger Halibut - Perfectly cooked fish! I wanted more of the black garlic sauce but overall really tasty and fantastic pairing.  Tagliatelle - This was the one miss with the presentation. The mushroom paste kinda looked like pooh (had to say it!) and the crouton was awkward on top of the pasta. But it the dish was so hearty and just the right amount to not leave you too full. Red was on the lighter end to balance the dish Beef/NY strip - Gorgeously composed. One miss here is the beef was not that sexy tender beef that you want, maybe because of the cut? It was closer to medium rare. When you ate all the elemnts together it was delicious, but judging the beef by itself, it left you wondering...Cab was amazing Chocolate - holy balls. One of the best desserts I have ever had. chicory coffee was amazing with it. I don't love port so can't fairly judge the pairing here....but WOW was this delicious! So food overall was great with only some small comments. here is where it lost the star. The service was so FAST! And I noticed a few others commented too. When you do a tasting w. a pairing you want time to savor and enjoy the wine. Many of us ordered starter cocktails and they brought out the first dish + pairing before most were even half way through their cocktails. And every single dish came before people could finish their previous wine leaving our table VERY cluttered.

My only complaint and the reason for the 4 stars is because of the service. We were early for our reservation but stopped in to see if perhaps we could get seated early. The hostess was as sweet as can be and politely told us no, even though the dining room was only about 1/2 full.  She told us that we could go to The Avenue across the street and wait.  Well, that was different but at least she made a suggestion. We headed over there, got about 1/2 block down the street and we heard our name being called. She was running down the street after us.  When she caught up to us, she let us know that if we didn't mind, we could have one of the larger tables. So, we went back and were seated.  When service was started, it was just a little awkward. After the 3rd course we had to ask them to slow down the service. The food was coming so fast that we could not enjoy the wine. They obliged to a point.  It was clear that the service of our food was at their convenience, not ours.   All of the wine was served in the same style/ size of glass. Admittedly, I am a bit of a wine snob and overall that doesn't bother me except when it comes to sparkling wine. It needs to be in an appropriate glass.  Overall it was a very pleasant experience and I would recommend it. The chef clearly knows what he is doing.",0.8931,0.847,0.094,0.059,0.4571428571428572

We split the pumpkin soup, the ""everything bagel"" gnocchi, the fois gras, and the duck.  All 4 dishes were superb.  I have nothing but positive things to say. We also tried the chocolate desert.  Again, nothing but positive things to say.

They are doing something special in that kitchen. The tuna amuse buche was remarkably delicate and fresh, while intensely flavorful. The housemade bread and butter was among the best I've had, even more remarkable considering Senza is 100% GF. We had the NY Strip and the Rohan Duck, both blew us away, being perfectly cooked with great nuance in the flavor and presentation. The fruit used on both dishes was a remarkable addition. For dessert we had the Chocolate, with chicory coffee. I don't even know where to begin, the chicory coffee through its taste and scent was the embodiment of autumn. We both held the cup up to our noses and inhaled multiple times. The chocolate was fantastic, rich, but light at the same time.

2012-10-17,5.0,"100% gluten free menu. Amazing food and service.  I am clearly on a roll in 2012 with finding places to eat that can not only accommodate my special dietary needs, but also get full approval from those dining with me (who have no special dietary needs).  This roll of mine does seem to be heavily OUTSIDE of the Kansas City area.  So kudos to any place in town who can meet my standards.  But I am perfectly capable of leaving town for meals. It just seems to be worth it sometimes.  And Senza is one of those places we plan to leave town for again soon. We stopped in more than once, and with multiple people.  Everyone loved their meals.  When you go in for breakfast (& I am assuming lunch as well), you order from the counter, and someone brings you your meal.  When you dine in the evening, it is a sit down, table service type of a meal with a server.   For anyone with a gluten intolerance (and especially those with Celiac Disease) you are entirely safe at Senza. There is not even a chance for cross-contamination.  But for those of you who have no issues with gluten or any other food offenders, you are also safe to enjoy your meal without the concern that it will be lacking in any way.  Senza does not operate or promote itself as gluten free - it just happens to BE gluten free.  Educated and resourceful folks utilize different types of flour and thickeners in cooking, and in this case, at Senza, they have chosen to utilize ingredients that do not contain gluten. This was my very first time having a breakfast sandwich in years, and I could not have been happier.  And much to my delight, I was even able to order a morning beverage like a normal person because they also had almond milk.  I was ready to come back that same night for dinner, I was so happy.  And GLUTEN FREE BEIGNETS??  Seriously? Too much.  It might be safer that I do not live near Senza. I should not be allowed close access to such a thing as gluten free beignets. Our other meals were dinner.  It was super nice and even a perfect setting for an intimate date or special occasion.  They have both a la carte AND a tasting menu during dinner service.  The tasting (with wine option) includes a regular, a vegetarian, and what they call the ""grand"" tasting menu option.  We each ordered our own separate items. But in the future, we definitely plan to try the tasting menu options. I do have to add that in addition to the taste of our food being amazing, the presentation was over the top awesome, too.  I don't need my food to look pretty.  But it sure is nice when it does.  And the BIG headline for me personally with dinner was - BREAD - they brought bread to the table before our meal arrived.  And I was actually able to eat said bread.  Needless to say I ate way too much bread. But boy was it good.   Oh, & they also have a creative cocktail menu which is posted on the chalkboard each day (I ordered an egg white cocktail that was out of this world).

2012-09-26,5.0,"I seriously love this place! I'm a gluten free consultant for a living, and this restaurant is my dream.  They don't even allow gluten in the restaurant at all.  I had a my wedding dinner here, and they were so incredibly kind and helpful.  The food is to-die-for.  You wouldn't believe you were eating gluten free.  It's such an amazing culinary experience.  I had the grand tasting and everything was amazing.  The only thing I wasn't blown away by was the rib entree.  They ribs weren't super moist, but everything else was great.  My favorite dish was definitely the tagliatelle.  The fish was great too, though. I can't wait to go here for breakfast and lunch! I hope this place makes it!",0.9903,0.666,0.301,0.033,0.7377777777777778
2012-09-22,4.0,"This place opened in late Aug and I can see it being a big, big hit in Chicago very soon. I've had plenty of fine dining experiences, but this is my first ""casual fine dining"" experience and it was amazing! There are two ways to dine at this place - you can order a la carte or order the prix fixe menu. The a la carte prices are average, very affordable (roughly $30-$40 a plate), but I would suggest the Grand prix fixe menu so you could taste everything this place has to offer. It's only $100/person and wine pairing is $40/person. Each course we had was presented very well and tasted even better. I won't go into the details for each course, you can see the menu for yourself on their website. I would just say that everything...everything was delicious. Very impressed by the innovation & presentation. Compared to Alinea, I liked the food here much better. Though Alinea is certainly much more impressive & over-the-top with their presentation, hence the reason why I like this ""casual fine dining"" experience so much. It's non-pretentious, just great food, great service, at a great, casual Lakeview neighborhood.  Speaking of the neighborhood, I think a lot of people are still surprised to find a place like this in the neighborhood since most restaurants up and down Broadway are more hole-in-the-wall style (I know there are some nice restaurants in the neighborhood as well) restaurants. You can come in here dressed casually and get great service. The server my wife and I had was very nice and attentive, a real pro. Reservation is highly recommended.

2012-09-19,5.0,"Senza was absolutely delicious!  Gluten-free or not, you will no doubt love this restaurant.  As a GF foodie, this is exactly the restaurant I have been looking for!  Most upscale restaurants can accommodate GF diets, but in this case you don't even have to ask a single question, you just order.  Do you hear this GF people?  YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU JUST ORDER OFF THE MENU.   AND whatever you order off the menu is bound to be amazing.  We started with an amuse that was mustard ice cream with pretzel crumbs and more. As a mustard freak, this was absolutely up my alley. (I have been to the mustard museum in WI)  I need to stop myself from gushing too much about each dish as this review would be so so soooo long.  Here is the rundown:  Butternut squash soup with pumpkin seeds, pomegranate, and LOBSTER was delicious with smoky spices and the perfect thing on the first cold day of the fall.  Tagliatelle was my entree and it was so good my brain hurts trying to describe it.  Truffles, mushrooms, pickled tomatoes, artichokes, delicate pasta, BREAD FOAM.  BREEEAAADDDD FOOOOOAAAAAM.  Get that in your facehole immediately.  Oh snap! I forgot to mention the cocktail I had was phenomenal.  Hendrick's gin, rhubarb, fizz, magic, delight, wonderment etc.  I did have dessert and it was so stupid good.  JUST GO THERE ALREADY.

2012-09-15,5.0,"I can't speak highly enough of Senza.  As someone with celiac disease, this restaurant is everything that I could ever hope for in a gluten free restaurant.   The location is 100% gluten free so I could order absolutely anything and not worry.  I can't tell you freeing and refreshing that is, and it is just one of the reasons why I love this place. I've had dinner and breakfast here (I understand they're currently ramping up for brunch and as of today they are open Saturdays at 10am) and both have been wonderful experiences.  Everything is made in-house and the dishes are both delicious and often exciting.   Some of the dishes are a little experimental and not for all palettes, for example I really enjoyed the foie gras with compressed strawberries but it was a little... unique for my boyfriend's tastes.  But for the most part, the majority of menu items are wins all around.   If you're going for breakfast - get the beignets and drip coffee.  If they have them that day, try the orange poppyseed muffins with an orange glaze, they're light but flavorful. For dinner, I splurged and went for the Grand tasting, and it was worth every penny but if you're going A la Carte I'd suggest the soup (rotating but I have yet to try one I haven't enjoyed) skirt steak (perfectly done) the gnocchi and the duck.  I can't pick a favorite dessert.  Aside from the food, the service is wonderful, the staff is incredibly knowledgable and they always ask about any dietary restrictions at the outset of your dining experience so they can be sure to accomodate.

2012-09-15,5.0,"Wonderful from top to bottom. Senza is clearly out to challenge a variety of perceptions--it's playing at a very high level already, with a tightly focused and impeccably executed menu. They treat their gluten-freeness lightly, which is also sort of a relief--too many attempts to work around gluten end up being sort of depressing. Still, it was such a relief to not have to interrogate anyone about ingredients and to not feel like a tremendous pain in the ass for the kitchen. But as I said, that's really the least of what's going on here. The stakes are clear from the amuse bouche. If you don't like the idea of a mustard ice cream dusted with celery powder--and we saw some diners who really, really did not--this might not be your favorite place. We loved it, though--it was crisp and aggressive, both cleansing the palate and throwing down a marker: yeah, that's right, mustard. In ice cream. To start. Are you up for this? The cocktails are fine but unremarkable next to the rest of the menu. The gin with rhubarb and the bourbon with ginger beer each went down nicely, but you can find much the same and better elsewhere. What you're unlikely to find are dishes as transcendent as what follows.  We started with the gnocchi and the scallops--the former coming with some unearthly smoked mushrooms. If the phrase ""crispy mushroom bacon"" excites you, this dish is for you. The gnocchi themselves (a delight for a celiac, let me tell you) were light--perhaps made from corn flour? The hard-poached egg brought the dish together as kind of symphony of breakfast flavors. The scallops did a similar magic in bringing together flavor combinations you might anticipate in surprising and delightful ways. Scallops and bacon (well, actually, an air-cured ham, but close enough)? Sure thing. Bacon and apple? Obviously. Apple and sauerkraut? Duh. Sauerkraut and Pernod? Well... yes, actually. But all those things in a single dish, with the apples more like pickles and the bacon so thin as to be translucent and crisp (and some peekytoe crab alongside just for the hell of it)? It was transcendent and rewarding in every bite, even as the basic affinities among the flavors kept it grounded and not at all frivolous. This isn't a place that serves, oh, Pop-Rocks-smoked bananas or whatever; there's thought and care and attention in every aspect of each dish. Mains: nicely medium-rare duck for me, and an incredibly tender skirt steak for my one-and-only. Again, the attention to the balance of flavors makes all the difference. The duck came with intensely salty slabs of Virginia ham and caramel popcorn. The sweetness of the corn kept everything else in check and made the dish as a whole both fun and rewarding. The steak's key accompaniment were a couple massive blackberries, along with some concentrated root vegetables and a smoked potato puree.  We split some chocolate business for dessert. A rich chocolate dessert isn't anything that special, really, but the little side cups of chicory were flavorful, and the mere presence of graham crackers made for a rare treat for a celiac. It was a solid ending to a shockingly good meal. My only real regret is that we didn't go for the full tasting menu. Next time for sure--if we can ever get a table again. Senza's not large, but its ambitions, performance, and potential are huge. Go.",0.9967,0.797,0.155,0.048,0.5645562456866806
