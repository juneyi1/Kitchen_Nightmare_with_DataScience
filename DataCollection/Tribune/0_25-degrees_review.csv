2017-08-21,2.0,Went there to celebrate a birthday.Went in happy and left pissed off!  Had a waitress that didn't know the difference between a wingette and a whole wing! She was the worst! Bad attitude and very snippy. Ordered a margarita that was the worst I've ever had. Although the bartender added more alcohol it didn't improve the taste.  Will not go back.  Will not recommend.,-0.9312,0.64,0.093,0.267,0.5407407407407407

2017-07-25,3.0,"I came here with a friend Sunday afternoon and it was quite an interesting experience. Upon walking in a hostess asked if we had a reservation. It's a burger spot and wasn't crowded so it was weird that she asked but that may indicate that it gets crowded here during the peak times.  Drinks: I thought it was cool they had spiked milk shakes. I ordered one but it was a bit stronger than I expected and it didn't pair well with my burger and fries so I ended up sending it back but cool concept nevertheless.  Menu: I wasn't super impressed with their menu. You are pretty much forced to build your own burger. The ones the have as options just wasn't anything spectacular. Be mindful when building your burger because it can add up quickly. I was shocked they didn't have a burger on the menu with a fried egg and bacon - that's like an American standard nowadays, right? Lol Food: I didn't like that pickles and lettuce come on the side... like you are back there making my burger, I requested lettuce and pickles so why not just throw it on? Me and my friend decided to split a large fry and they were massive! We both agreed we should've just split the smaller portion. The burgers were messy so I wouldn't go here on a first date lol Overall the food was good though! Service: Service was kind of lacking. The waitress wasn't attentive even though it wasn't busy. She charged us for the shake I returned. Then when I reminded her to take it off, she walked right to the register and kept it on anyway. She was very sweet and apologetic about it and mentioned it was a rough Sunday, which I understand! We are all human and deserve some grace. Temperature: It was hot outside plus two parties had dogs with them so we opted to eat inside the restaurant where they had the patio door open. When I tell you it was hotter inside than outside, man! We walked out and were relieved by the breeze. They may want to get some fans blowing or turn the air on when it's hot out.  Overall: Overall it was an alright experience. Nothing I'll be running to bring other people to but if I'm in the area and hungry I would possibly go back to. The food was good, the prices were typical and the atmosphere was good! Don't go out of your way to come here but you should maybe possibly check it out lol",0.9951,0.786,0.164,0.049,0.5108333333333335

I loved visiting hidden gems that are not touristy when I travel, and I was far from disappointed. Our server was fantastic and the food was everything I expected it to be.  My boyfriend and I created our own burgers, and let me just say, the garlic aioli could make cardboard delicious. The portion sizes are huge, definitely shareable, but trust me, you aren't going to share.  They also have local beer on tap, big bonus from me! * This is a sports bar, so the music is loud, but you won't be interested in talking once the food hits the table.

We arrived around 5pm and were just in time for half price apps and beer (which ends at 7pm)! We ordered the wings and nachos and they were both goooood.  The nachos were actually like open faced quesadillas topped with a ton of guac, salsa, and cheese! It was nachos without all the mess- genius! The wings were also bomb! The chilli honey wings had some nice heat plus sweetness and were perfectly crispy.  Last but not least, we each ordered a burger. Yes, we were STARVING! Fiance ordered number 1 (had blue cheese and arugula) and I ordered number 6 (their version of a big Mac). Both were killer good and we were insanely stuffed after!  Meal was super delicious and filling, and overall, great bang for your buck.  Go here for great burgers, great beer and just for a chill time.

Neither of us could decide which we liked better--they were equally delicious. The best way I can describe them is that the Number One is like a really good traditional burger, while the Number Two is a more unique flavor with the pesto and roasted tomato. It really just depends on what you are in the mood for! We split a small regular fry, which was plenty for two people to go with the burgers.  Lastly, the S'more shake I had was incredible.

2017-06-24,4.0,"The review is somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars  We came here around 7 pm on a Friday night. We were able to get seated right away. There was no availability for outdoor seating but there were plenty of tables to sit inside and along the bar. Our server was very attentive and knowledgable. Our water glass was always full and we didn't have to wait for him- he checked on us periodically. It got a little crowded and loud as the night went on since people were standing around the bar and blocking the walkway, but overall good ambiance.  For drinks i got frosé and my boyfriend got the spiked grape soda. Both drinks were excellent. Tasted great and were strong. The only thing I would say is that my frosé melted very quickly. We started with the pork belly slider ($12) and the chicken wings. I was excited to try the sliders, but they were rather disappointing. The ratio was completely off. The pork belly was so thin compared to the bun. The coleslaw added a nice texture but couldn't make up for the lack of pork belly. For $4 a slider, I was expecting a little more. The chicken wings were standard. It came with 8 pieces (I think). The buffalo sauce had a nice kick and we requested for the bleu cheese to be on the side.  For our mains, I decided to go with the egg sandwich ($12) and my boyfriend got the number 3 ($13). None of the sandwich/burgers come with fries, they need to be ordered separately. We decided to get a large fry ($4.50) to share, with a side of truffle aioli. I kind of regret getting the egg sandwich, I was hoping for something similar to the one from Eggslut but it was not. They used sandwich bread instead of a bun. I believe it was like a brioche bread- very soft. It fell apart immediately after I took the first bite. It was a hard sandwich to eat. I wish there was more bacon in the sandwich. However, the aioli was flavorful and the egg yolk was cooked perfectly (lots of ooze!). The lettuce was shredded and not whole which made it become soggy quickly. I don't think I would order this sandwich again. On the other hand, my boyfriend's burger was seasoned very well. There was perfect ratio of bun, meat, avocado, sauce, and cheese. It had a kick to it but very well seasoned. If we come back, I think I will try a burger instead. The fries are very similar in shape and texture to McDonald fries. They serve them in a takeout box, poured onto the plate. I wish they just served it all on the plate because the ones that were still in the box, ended up becoming soggy from the steam. The truffle aioli was perfect with the fries. They do charge an extra $1 for the aioli.   They do not have any desserts beside the shakes. We weren't in the mood for shakes but they definitely looked good! Although all the drinks and food came out in reasonable time, nothing came out piping hot- all the food was lukewarm. Perhaps we will come back here, but most likely only for the drinks and to try the shakes.",0.9969,0.831,0.138,0.03,0.5999550763701706

My friend went with the turkey burger and chocolate banana shake which he said were both great. There was a mix up with our shakes initially but they fixed it right away and were very gracious about the mistake. The only downside is it was really hot outside and we were seated by the open wall that lead to the patio so we were sweating by the time we left.

2016-12-12,5.0,"A friend and I decided to dine here after seeing the great reviews and craving burgers. Seoul Taco was right next door, an intriguing combination of Korean and Mexican was a bit difficult to pass up but in the end we settled to try 25 Degrees like we intended! My friend ordered a number one, pork belly sliders, and I ordered a number two and a night owl cocktail. The burgers tasted amazing, cooked as requested (double patty), and  each respective burger had a a great combination of additional meat and sauces. We both liked our choices and were relieved the meal did not come with fries. Go with what sounds best to you; typically that never serves me wrong at a burger place. The Number Two burger includes prosciutto, tomato and a pesto sauce. I don't really like pesto but I love prosciutto and was worried the saltiness of the prosciutto along with the dislike of the pesto may make me regret my choice. After consuming the burger, I was pleasantly surprised. The pesto was a great compliment to the prosciutto so the saltiness did not take away from the burgers' flavors. The cocktail shake was really good; I prefer sweeter drinks but if you prefer something stronger, I would not recommend this particular mix. The service shines here, we requested the sliders to be served before burgers and they were not. The waitress was very apologetic and took it off our tab even though we insisted it was not a big deal. The extra mile that she took for us as first time customers left a great impression.

Ok well maybe I could have built a better burger one time but clearly my fault and not their fault. 25 Degrees is a build your own burger place in River North. As far as the food goes everything has been very good. They have about 5 prebuilt options including a yellow tail tuna burger. The meat is great and the options plentiful as far as toppings, sauce and cheese go. A large side of fries will easily feed 2. I usually opt to go half and half with regular and sweet potato fries. They usually have 7 or 8 rotating taps for draft beers and a full bar. The bar is a semicircle in the middle of restaurant with OK viewing of TVs if you go on a saturday or sunday for football or some other televised sporting event. The ambience is somewhat dark but certainly not too dark. Like most places in Chicago they will put the audio on for the bears game but will show most other games going on. I should also mention they have spiked milkshakes that are fantastic. Don't say I didn't warn you if you cant finish your burger after getting one of their milkshakes.

That's about what you would pay at Au Cheval for a burger, fries and a drink...so that's the lens at which I'm viewing the restaurant.

2016-09-11,1.0,"I went here on Sunday evening with my wife and her friend based on the friend's rave about the spiked shakes. The place was pretty empty (considering it was 8pm on a Sunday!) so we got seated immediately. The wife and I shared an amazing spiked shake called Night Owl which was chocolate heaven and quite delicious! Based on the drink alone, I'd give this place 5 stars but, alas, everything else at this place was dreadful. Ordered a custom burger with blue cheese and truffle aioli which sounded good on paper but ended up being super salty and overcooked (ordered medium rare so you'd think the chef would be able to keep the burger from getting cremated!). The fries were so-so but did compliment the shake pretty  well. The worst part of our experience, however, was the service. You would think a restaurant with only 4 occupied tables would be less eager to turn tables and would leave its patrons in relative peace. But that was not to be. Our bus boy came to our table thrice as we were putting burgers in our mouth to ask if we were done. You would think a chewing mouth is an indication that we are still eating. My wife, out of politeness, relinquished her plate to this impatient soul just so he could stop standing at the corner of our table. And let's continue with our server who shall not be named. Suffice it to say that I had to walk to her and present the check myself and was met with a glare on committing this act of kindness. This restaurant might have good spiked shakes but it's not worth the 85 dollars you pay if the food and service are horrible (and salty!) Many better, cheaper and more welcoming burger/shake establishments out there, fellow Yelpers! Don't waste your time and money here.",0.9837,0.74,0.167,0.093,0.6183333333333334
2016-09-04,5.0,"My friend and I decided to try this place last night, and WOW did we love it! I'll start with our waiter, Alberto. He was super nice, passionate about the food, gave us a great overview of the menu with his favorites and their customer favorites. And he was spot on with everything! We both opted to build our own burger (I went with beef patty, mild cheddar, jalapeno bacon, caramelized onions, arugula, garlic aioli,). We also split fries/onion rings. And we each got a signature cocktail. Here's the highlights: 1. Cooked EXACTLY to order - medium rare was truly medium rare. 2. They scoop out a little of the breading in the bun so you get BURGER and not bread as the overall flavor note. But the bun was also very fresh and tasty. 3.) Thick beef patty but so dang juicy and high quality. All the ingredients were top notch. 4.) Beer battered onion rings that were perfectly cooked (crispy, not greasy), and delicious french fries that are thin to medium cut and perfectly cooked as well. 5.) Refreshing, delicious cocktails. I had a vodka basil drink that was spot on and way better than Zed's across the street. We wanted to try one of their spiked milkshakes but just were too full. Next time! After all that, Alberto brought us a taste of their homemade Fireball. Even if you're not a whisky fan, it was awesome! You could tell that Alberto was just excited to chat with us about food, liquor, etc. I love it when the staff is TRULY a fan of the food they serve, and his enthusiasm just made it so much more fun for us, too. In short, we had an absolute blast! We rank it as one of the best burgers in the city (and we are both burger fans and have tried many). Definitely going back.

FOOD - The menu isn't huge which i'm complete fine with since sometimes when the menu is too big things get confusing and or hard to make a decision. Our appetizer and food + drinks taste phenomenal.  DECOR/ATMOSPHERE - The decor is right up my alley. Dim lights, touch of class, appealing. Very clean all around with nice table presentation. I also enjoyed the music selection! Wide variety but all tasteful. It was also not overly loud. They also had it open in front which door was a garage door, that added a cool look and feel to the whole place.  $$$ - Prices were good.

2016-04-09,4.0,"An Instagram picture of the #6 burger lured me into this place. As I walked through the door, I thought I had stepped into the 1960s. I saw candelabrias, chandeliers, and dark red and pink rose wallpaper that looked so out of place from what one would expect at a burger joint. The front even had a garage door with the tracks for the door, so the decor felt a little bit mismatched. I didn't really care for the music as it was all hip hop. The menu is so different than what one would expect at a burger place. Sonoran hot dogs, Cuban sandwiches, numerous grilled cheese sandwiches. I love that they I offer over a dozen cheese for their burgers and they give brief descriptions of each one. For the burger, you can create your own, or they have six different combos that they recommend. I went with the number six, which was essentially a souped up version of the In n Out animal style. Two patties, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, caramelized onions, Thousand Island, garlic aioli, andm mustard on a soft spongy seedless bun. It came wrapped up in paper and it needed two, because with each bite, the burger explodes into a bigger and bigger mess. I was constantly picking up pieces of lettuce, onion, and cheese and shoving it back into the burger. I asked for the beef to be cooked medium and it was perfectly pink on the inside and juicy. I also got sweet potato fries, which had garlic-parmesan-salty taste to them. Pretty solid. And they make a lot of spiked shakes; I opted for the Banana fosters shake. LEt me just say you can definitely taste the rum in this one. I would have gotten a draft beer since they were half off during happy hour, but I stopped with the shake. Camille was my bartender and she was very helpful with explaining the menu. Plus she was quite good-looking too. The price was around $30, not exactly cheap for a burger, fries, and spiked shake.

They have a few non-sirloin oriented things on the menu, but ignore that non-sense and go for the burgers. You could be a jabroni and go with one of the pre-selected burgers, but that would be the same as using the assisted rack in the gym.  Go ahead and throw on double meat, double cheese, double bacon, garlic aoli and some smokey mozzarella. Not only will it help you achieve your swol goals with all of that protein, but you will look more manly than eating a basic turkey burger.  Food = 5 Stars, due to Protein.  Coming into the place there was no Blackhawks on the television, which of course is an immediate negative 1 star. They did however have the Bulls game, while not Blackhawks nation, I appreciate the effort to pay homage. Plus 1 star! Now the bad part, the Bulls lost the game...so negative 1 star which brings us back to where we started.  The other negative is that the place is basically full of dudes. What's the point of ordering this bomb burger with no one to watch me flex it off. Let em Watch, Let em Watch. Negative 1 star.

2016-04-01,3.0,"In Chicago for the first time last weekend and really wanted a good burger - 25 Degrees came up on Yelp with good reviews, so decided to try it. I was overall impressed with the quality of the food but the staff on the overhand left me and my friend with a terrible taste in our mouths when we left. At first our waitress was super helpful, explaining the drinks and what we should get etc. I cannot have a lot of dairy - so she advised me not to get an ""Adult Milkshake"" because it's VERY much dairy. I had a mojito- it was OK but overpriced for the overall quality. My burger. OMG. So good. I got one with avocados, jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese. It was cooked to perfection. It was pretty pricey..another negative  ($13.00) and it was just the burger. If you wanted french fries or onion rings etc. it was extra. My friend and I split thw 1/2 & 1/2 which i onion rings and french fries. Both were extremely good and well worth it. The restaurant closes at 2:00AM and we were there at 9:00PM - 10:30 PM and our waitress kept bothering us if we were done. She came over about 6-7 times mid bite asking if we were done or if we wanted the check. The place wasn't crowded, and we had have reservations and weren't even there an hour at that point. On top of it, she sent the bartender, and one of the cooks over to ask if we were done too! It was annoying , and not very nice at all. I finally got fed up and asked her : are you guys closing? Is that why you want us to leave so bad? To which she responded no we close at 2AM, take your time...SUCH MIXED SIGNALS. I would come back here if in Chicago ever again.

Burgers came out over cooked and were tasteless. The bacon was tough, the fries lacked salt, and the condiments were lukewarm to touch. The food runners were inattentive and rude.

When each person began claiming their meals, the server would hand off plates to the person closest to them and walk away without asking if anything else was needed.

I had the Cinnashake which is fireball, rumchata and vanilla ice cream (kind of tastes like spiked egg nogg) it was absolutely perfect. My bestie got the shake that had Makers Mark in it, wasn't really a fan of that one. As an entree I ordered the Number Five burger. You must order this! It was great!

2015-11-14,4.0,"A big group of friends and I went to 25 Degrees for brunch, and overall, the food was pretty good, but I felt like I was in a club the entire time I was here. I will say, though, this place is pretty busy for brunch. The menu was sort of confusing, because they have breakfast scrambles and burgers all named 'number one,' 'number two,' and 'number three.' So if you just say ""I'll have a number three,"" you're really ordering two different things. Beyond the scrambles and the burgers, there are only a few other options for brunch. This is not an exhaustive menu. The burger I had was cooked very well, and the burger patty quality was high - that's basically all I ask for from a burger. The brunch drinks are pretty affordable. It's $10 a bottle for this Andre clone, with all the various juice if you want. So it's basically four or five mimosas for $10, which isn't bad. The atmosphere is very loud. They legit have club music the entire time, even at 11:30 and 12:30. Especially for those nursing a hangover, listening to club foods music may not be the remedy they're looking for. They did have a lot of TVs everywhere, so I guess this place doubles as a sports bar sometimes, since you can see if you screens no matter where you sit here. The service was kind of stuffy and condescending, but it all matters who you get. We were a large group, so maybe that had something to do with it, since we were two large tables.

I ordered the 25 degrees fried egg sandwich and substituted jalapeño bacon for the applewood smoke bacon. I also had garlic aioli on the side to dip my sandwich in with each bite. It was delicious. I mean, nothing mind-blowing, but I was very happy with my dinner. I had the salty caramel spiked milk shake and they did not hold back when it came to adding Maker's Mark. My friends ordered a root beer float and a strawberry milkshake. Both were very good. One thing 25 Degrees absolutely does right is their milkshakes.  Unfortunately, the same can not be said of their burgers. My friend's burger was awful. The quality of the ground sirloin was mealy and almost inedible. She left half of her burger uneaten and when I tried to finish it for her, I found that I did not want to take a second bite. I think it's a tragedy when a restaurant in Chicago can't execute cooking beef properly. I would probably go back to 25 Degrees for drinks or a nightcap, but definitely not for food.

2015-10-12,4.0,"Every time a friend says they want a non-basic burger, I suggest 25 Degrees, but mostly because of the milkshakes. Between the eclectic music, the TVs, and the red velvet walls, it's kind of a confusing ambiance but you'll never have to worry about waiting for a table. If you sit at the bar, the stools by the door are bolted kind of far apart, so depending on how closely you want to sit to your dining companion, you may or may not want to avoid that. A few tips on the food: 1. The portions for fries are pretty massive. You'll need a good number of people to finish a large order unless you're splitting a burger. 2. The burgers tend to be on the rare side. My medium well sometimes comes back with a lot of pink so check before you dig in if you're picky about that. 3. The Brussels sprouts are delicious, but only if you like tart foods. 4. Don't leave without getting a milkshake. The prices are probably higher than they should be, but sometimes I'm just hungry and am willing to throw a little extra money at the problem to make it go away.",0.9679,0.818,0.152,0.03,0.5939285714285715

I got a turkey burger with avocado, arugula, garlic aioli, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles. My boyfriend got the #3 burger that had some green chilis. We also split half onion rings and half sweet potato fries. There were definitely somethings that really wowed me, but a lot of other that were just...meh. The green chilis were awesome. I loved the arugula and the onion rings. The sweet potato fries were really salty and the turkey burger was alright. I know, I know. That's what I get for ordering turkey, but I've had some pretty bomb turkey burgers so maybe I'm just being particular. Our waitress was...interesting. She was...nice, but it didn't feel genuine. It felt like she was trying to seem nice without actually being nice, if that makes any sense. She also kept trying to upsell us on everything from ordering shakes and more things on our burgers and sauces. It was kind of annoying. Also my burger came with pickles, if you asked for them, so my boyfriend asked for some extra. She charged us TWO DOLLARS for pickles. I'm sorry WHAT? I could have gone out and bought a jar of pickles for like a dollar more. That was definitely a shocker when we got our check and there was this obscure $2 item (it didn't even say it was for pickles). My biggest pet peeve at restaurants is when servers don't mention that they charge extra for things. It's like you're just trying to pad your own wallet by increasing our bill, which is in my opinion, not super cool. I'd rather you be upfront and honest with me and then I'll just tip you well, regardless. Overall, it was an okay experience, but the service really put me off.

Never have I seen a place give little glass bottles of refills of sodas. Major brownie points for that idea so the waitress doesn't have to check-in so often on a group.

Our waitress was also great with giving suggestions on what was her favorite and what we could order for what mood we were in.  Food: That. Number. Three. Wow. One of my favorite burgers ever. The better part about it is that it wasn't a burger that just fell apart when you picked it up. It was constructed well and hand made delicious. Their fries were nice and crisp as well. I tried my friend's sweet potato fries and they weren't too sweet but not bland - just right!

I just moved here so granted I have yet to visit a ton of places, but so far 25 degrees is #1. I decided to have brunch here.  I was the first (and only) customer of the day. So I had no wait, and was offered the best customer service ever! I ordered the #1 special and a mimosa. Bit pricy because of the $7 mimosa but was it worth it? Absopositively! ...this was the best burger I have ever had in my entire life. ever. This is not an exaggeration. The bun was made in house! It was fresh, soft, yeasty, buttery. Perfect. The beef was seasoned absolutely perfectly, and when made medium well (slight pink) it was so juicy that some of it ran down the sides of the paper. I did not want Thousand Island dressing on my burger so I opted out and added the garlic aioli instead. I also had sweet potato fries splashed with hot sauce. Another huge factor that makes 25 degrees my #1 spot, is the interior decor. As an interior designer myself, I was screaming inside when I entered the space and beheld all of the ox blood tufted leather booths, the dark red damask wall paper, and the chandeliers at the bar.

Loud music combined with a very young crowd at the front playing College drinking games & Twister inside the bar did not bode well for those looking for a fun, chill vibe with good food. I asked the manager, Steve, to turn the music down & he said it wasn't possible because the music is set to a certain level and simply dismissed me. I find this very hard to believe. We have been in before during the day & the music was never this loud. He never came back to check on us, our experience nor anyone else in the restaurant. This used to be one of our favorite places.

Hostess kept running off to next door pay car parking lot. Watched a bus boy use an old water glass to pour on the table and clean the table prior to us sitting. Food was okay. Sweet potato fries were nice.  I ordered a burger medium well. It was medium rare. No napkins or utensils ever arrived. Tried to waive down waitress or hostess but they were standing around talking. Got up and went to the bus boy station to get my own. What a joke of a place. Wanted to have a glass of wine but couldn't stay there longer. Went to kerryman and had a glass of wine.

My burger turned out really good and quite spicy, just the way I like it! They have tons of ingredients you can choose from so I would recommend you build your own. Onion rings could have been crispier but the sweet potato fries were quite good as well. After we finished the burgers we ordered a round of their ""adult"" milkshakes. These guys are very boozy and pretty expensive because of it. I got the salty caramel which was whiskey based. Really good, really alcoholic. Overall, the food and shakes were great! Only reason I can't give them 5 stars is everything was a bit too expensive. A bill of $150 for 5 people for burgers and alcoholic milkshakes is a lot.

It's dark woods, dim lighting, plush seats ... and a giant bar. /FOOD A place known for its burgers was something I was hoping was an experience to take back home. Not so much. The burger was all dressed up flair -- a Smart car with a Lamborghini kit.  There was just something missing in the flavor. If you've ever been to a place where the burger could really stand on its own, you know what I'm talking about. I've had much better and much cheaper. The fries and rings were nothing above forgettable. /SERVICE She was really nice. Exceptionally nice. Not very attentive on a very slow afternoon though.

My main reason for visiting this joint were the grown-up milkshakes. Not too many places do these. Ice cream and liquor, my two favorite foods. Well actually Italian Beef is but mixing it with Ice Cream brings rather vomit-inducing nightmares. So lets stick with my milkshake. I ordered up a Cinnashake ( House-made Cinnamon Whiskey, Rumchata, Ice Cream and Graham Crackers). That just sounds like too good of a delicious treat. It tasted like one too. Thick, creamy, sweet, and boozy. Impressively enough I could distinctively taste all of those flavor profiles, a very well crafted beverage. My friend had the Makers Mark Shake with salty caramel. Yum! I will eventually try them all! On this Saturday Night I was just looking to chill out and relax. I could not have felt more relaxed than I was at 25°. Sipping my milkshake was all I really wanted to do. For some reason I think the wallpaper helped to induce that feeling. It was red with a velvet-like texture to it. I hear this is popular in the Portland and Seattle food scenes. If anyone knows about this please shed some light? Their burgers are supposed to be pretty good as well so that will be next with a milkshake of course. Never leave here without the milkshake. Lastly the service was impeccable.

I ordered the Number One burger and Onion Rings. The Number One - Caramelized Onion, Vella Toma cheese, Aderkasse Reserve Bacon, Arugula, Thousand Island sauce. This was definitely one of the best tasting burgers I've had.  The ground sirloin was ground fine, so every bite just melted in your mouth.  The combination of topping had remarkable flavor.  Simple, but executed very well.  The Onion Rings were fresh cut and lightly battered with a good seasoning. After finishing lunch we decide to hang around a little while and have a quick cocktail.  I normally don't do the sweet drinks, but I had a ""Spiked Soda"".  Oranage Soda - Stoli Oranje Vodka, Salerno Blood Orange liqueur, Orange Crush soda, and Orange Juice.

My first experience here was for a Yelp Elite event during Burger Binge Week and was blown away by the food and friendly service. I've since been back and have not been disappointed.  Of the spiked milkshakes I've tried, definitely go with the Guinness (think grown up chocolate milkshake) and the salty caramel milkshakes - gotta love that salty sweet combination.  For the burgers, I've had numbers one, two and three. It's hard to pick a favorite, but I really love the two and three. The two is their Italian interpretation of a burger and has an herbaceous pesto, roasted tomato, creamy burrata and crispy salty prosciutto. On the number three burger, they add a Latin flair to their burger with spicy mezzo secco jack cheese, smoky chipotle, green chiles and buttery avocado.  In addition to the burgers, I highly recommend trying out some of their snacks & sides. I've tried their wings (crispy fried wings lathered in spicy chili honey glaze) , bacon wrapped dates (stuffed with bleu cheese), potato croquettes (3 cheese mix), but my favorite by far is their spicy tuna served on crispy eggplant. I would come back solely for this dish. There are so many flavors and textures going on in this dish. The tuna is so well seasoned and has a spicy kick.

2014-12-06,3.0,"Since coming back to the States from a recent trip to (redacted), we've told ourselves on a weekly basis that a good ""all-American"" burger fest was in order.  Burgers sound good in theory: juicy, meaty, saucy, with lots of options and sides. Culinary freedom of expression, served with a side of beer and freedom fries. What could be more patriotic?  The sad soggy reality is that the median burger found in our great nation is overcooked, dry, and plain boring. Instead of facing crushing disappointment and the inevitable visit by the INS, we have been successful in reacquainting ourselves with that quintessential American staple of Mexican food. So it was with trepidation that I accepted an invitation to 25 Degrees from my owner and her friends and submitted to being stuffed into my carrier. On second thought, it wasn't really an invitation, so much as a precondition to being fed that night. We arrived at 8pm sharpish on a Friday night, and the place was already humming. Parking is conveniently available right next door in a valet lot. The price is ostensibly $12.50 overnight, but the parking attendant exercised business acumen and charged us the day rate of $15. Beats street parking and walking in the cold though. We were seated immediately (two of our group arrived earlier and staked out a table for seven + tall cat chair). At .25 waitresses per head, our service was a bit slow, but the drinks kept coming and the food eventually arrived. All of us ordered burgers, and they were universally great. I got mine rare, and could not have been happier: the vision of true America was before me, wrapped in a little paper dress, ready to party. Kentucky-whiskey-barrel-aged-beer on tap was likewise a smash hit. Sweet potato fries and crispy onion rings, Cucumber Collins, Spiked Shakes, all the fare was lauded as excellent and rapidly devoured.  Up to this point the party was going strong: attractive, well-dressed downtowners were swarming the bar, when suddenly to my horror the loud but festive music piped over the speakers was replaced with enthusiastic and a tympanic-membrane-shattering live act. Our cozy table was situated directly beneath one of the stadium sized speakers, and conversation was replaced by a laryngitis-inducing game of ""Who's on first?"".  TLDR: Great food, ok service, and infernally loud atmosphere translate to an A-OK review. Come early for the food and the tasty beer, and leave before the rock concert begins.  On the upside, if you got dragged into partying with some people you don't know-and would rather not ever get to know-the absence of conversation may rather prove a boon.

The disappointment was the burger.  The stars of any burger, i.e., the beef and bun, just had no flavor.  This might have been the first restaurant ever where I actually asked for salt.  The topping were nice, but ultimately this tasted like a fancy burger at a higher end place that doesn't care much about burgers, but has it on the menu for kids.  I'd have expected given that 25 Degrees is all about burgers, that they'd have perfected the patty part of it.  Develop some char taste,  season it better, and get the texture right so it's not as dense.   Not sure I'll go back, though I would like to try the shakes.  For a burger though in the area, I'd go to Big N Littles.",0.9675,0.782,0.163,0.055,0.5004668534080299

Also, we realized the next day, she charged us for the full price of the dates, even though we ordered during happy hour when it was 1/2 off. I got the number 3. It was pretty tasteless.

I hardly ate any. My husband usually eats everything. However, he got the number 2 and only finished half of it. He said a McDonald's burger would have been better. He NEVER fails to finish a meal! I had a bite of his and sadly, I thought mine was less worse. He said the sweet potato fries were good though. He also got the Guinness and he said both times it was super watered down.

Overall, not that impressed with the veggie burger but loved the service, ambiance and SHAKES. Started with the tempura green & yellow beans, which came with some type of spicy ranch sauce. A HUGE appetizer or side to split with 3+ people, it was pretty tasty if you like tempura stuff and beans. We asked for more sauce and finished the entire platter. I had read that the Number 1 was the best, so I ordered that with a veggie patty and without the bacon. Unfortunately I was brought a veggie patty WITH bacon (not good) but was able to give the bacon to my husband to add to his Number 1. Removing the bacon and having this in veggie form seemed to have messed with the recipe too much. It became very bland tasting to me. Very , eh. My husband even said that it wasn't as good as he'd remembered, so not sure if they've messed with the construction of it or what, apparently didn't stand up to all the glowing reviews. The shakes though...AMAZING! I tried the Cinnashake which has Rumchata in it, and have taken a gallon of that stuff down. 100% amazing, TRY IT NOW!

2014-06-20,5.0,"This restaurant was highly recommended from my Chicago and Detroit friends. I'm so glad we stopped in! We were walking down Clark Street and stumbled upon a nice outdoor seating area; sure enough it was 25 Degrees. We walked in and were greeted by a gentleman who seated us in a leather booth overseeing the entire restaurant. It was bright enough from the open patio and intimate enough to enjoy a private lunch with my husband. I loved the decor; modern vintage at its finest. From the booth, to the open bar, the lighting, and mood, this place was fabulous...and we hadn't even eaten anything yet!  After we were seated, we ordered a few apps to try out, considering it was our only meal of the day before we traveled back to Detroit. We tried the spicy tuna, bacon wrapped dates, chili-honey chicken wings, potato & 3 cheese fritters, and the tempura green & yellow beans. I was able to try a piece of each and have to say I liked each one of them. The spicy tuna comes out on a tempura eggplant slice; these are unique and have a nice texture and flavor. They aren't too spicy and have a faint kick. These are definitely worth trying if you like tuna. The bacon wrapped dates are full of flavor and delicious. I had no idea what to expect, but they are a nice combo of sweet and salty. I was hesitant to try these, but they are worth the order! The chili-honey chicken wings were coated with sauce and the honey was such a nice compliment to the chili spice. I would order these as an entree next time. The potato & 3 cheese fritters were good too. They are pretty much fried cheese balls with dipping sauce. Seems simple, but again, I was impressed with how much flavor they have. The tempura green beans even surprised me with how good they were. I loved each sample of the apps we tried and would recommend them all. My favorites were the dates and spicy tuna. For our meal, my husband and I both ordered the Number One burgers. These are HUGE (half pound), ground sirloin burgers that come with fries. The Number One has caramelized onion, Vella toma (type of Italian cheese, ""made by the farmer himself""), Aderkasse Reserve bacon, arugula, and thousand island dressing. After 3 bites, I couldn't eat anymore. But that is one of the best burgers I've ever had! I was so mad we got apps because of how good that burger was. My husband and I both got ours boxed and ended up eating them on the train on our way back home. This place has food that is loaded with flavor.

Their patties are cooked to perfection and just large enough to fill you up, but not so big that they are difficult to eat once you pile on the toppings. The Number One burger is an absolute must try-bacon, caramelized onions, and cheese smothered in house made dressing-so good. However, if you're looking to try something different the Number Two has an Italian twist with pesto, burrata and prosciutto. 25 Degrees is also an awesome brunch spot. I've gone several times for their bottomless mimosa/bloody deal and have tried a couple of the brunch dishes. I definitely recommend the breakfast quesadilla if you're looking for a solid hangover dish (although its hard not to go straight for a burger).

If I hadn't been there with such a big group, I would have sent it back. 25 degrees - if you don't change out this awful tuna burger, please have your servers warn your customers that is not fresh and it's fried.

The bun was greasier than I would like, but it was definitely one of the best burgers that I've ever bitten into...until I was already full by the third bite! I normally pride myself in being able to put down a lot of food, but those half pound burgers kill me every time unless I'm STARVING and ready to eat a whole cow.

We also got a half & half order of onion rings and sweet potato fries, which were average and definitely not helping with the food baby situation. In my subsequent visits, I've tried non-burger items like their grilled veggie sandwich and Tuscan Tomato Soup, which were not good so I've reverted back to my normal order of the #3 and just dealt with the consequences afterwards. I've also come here with a Gilt deal, which included drinks and a spiked shake to share and while the drinks weren't very good (RE: weak), the shake was the BOMB!

I liked them both.   Shake: $6 regular shake - chocolate and banana flavor. It was a little pricey. But it was great. My friend tried $10 alcoholic shake. We tasted and not a big fan of it.

2014-05-02,3.0,"Named after the precise temperature difference between a raw and well-done hamburger, 25 Degrees aims to deliver a creative, yet sophisticated twist to the traditional burger bar. At first glance, the interior decor successfully captures the sophisticated feel of urban chic -- a balance between contemporary and vintage. The interior screams ""60's mod look"" with a modern, swanky touch: low-lighting, magenta velvet flocked wallpaper, gold framed mirrors, and crystal chandeliers. If you're going to 25 Degrees for the ambiance and casual, bar vibe, you will not be disappointed. If you're hoping to add 25 Degrees to your ""Best Burgers"" list, though, they still leave something to be desired. Why, you ask? Because their burgers are highly overrated and terribly overpriced. You have the option to build your own burger or to choose one from a very short list of burgers with pre-selected toppings. Both can be very pricey, but be cautious when customizing your own burger. Each topping is an additional charge of AT LEAST $1. Want to add cheese, expect to pay at least $2. CRAZY, right? Just a burger can easily set you back $14+ without any additional sides or drinks... or a tip to your lovely waitress. Price-wise, their burgers are expensive. But what about taste? Eh, they are decent *shrugs*. It would taste better if it were priced more appropriately -- nothing I would pay $12+ for again. As mentioned before, though, if you're just stopping by 25 Degrees for the casual, bar vibe, you're bound to have a good time. Grab a delicious spiked milkshake at the bar and listen to some good tunes. I could see this as a short stop on a bar crawl but not as a regular burger joint.",0.9838,0.787,0.155,0.058,0.6009617732694658

The Mister got the number #3 which he added an extra slice of the mecco secco jack, taking it over the top. I built my own with beef, fried egg, jalapeño bacon, green chile and cheddar cheese.

Note: you can order all of their wine in 8, 16 or 32oz pours, which I love. When we were finally ready to order we started with the charcuterie plate, which had a generous portion of 3 meats, 3 cheeses and fresh Italian bread. Please also take note that they have about 15 different types of cheeses to choose from (hello, awesome) for the charcuterie plate, and your burger. Everything was fresh and we had plenty to take home for later. My boyfriend got a ""build your own"" burger and thought it was delicious. They have endless burger combinations to choose from, or you can customize the burger with about 50 different options. The bread and the meat make their burgers outstanding.

Now, the toppings are what really jazz up the meal, wouldn't you agree?  Like a chunky necklace and cute moccasins to an outfit.  Turkey burger + goat cheese is a winner every time in my book; add some tangy bbq sauce and you're golden.  I also added some jalapeno bacon, but unfortunately it fell short.  I didn't get any heat, no punch, no bite.  Just tasted like regular ol' bacon to me.  Other toppings included roasted red peppers, avocado, green chili, etc.  And each burger comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle if you wish.  Oo, lets go back to the cheese for a moment.  That cheese list, I will admit, is something kinda special.  About 15 cheeses to choose from and all sound pretty spectacular.  Buttttt not all of them list the type of cheese... I love cheese but I don't know everything about every cheeses... would be easier to make my selection if the menu listed the variety along with adjectives describing it.  ie. ""Burrata - mild, soft, fresh, creamy.""  I have no idea what kind of cheese that is... so either I have to Google it as I sit there or ask the waiter to run down the cheese list.  The bun (I think it was brioche) was so soft with just the tiniest hint of a toasted crunch.  It was just the right item to complete this burger.  And while it was a good size bun, the burger was bigger than the bun.  And that is awesome.  How many times do you go to a restaurant and end up with a bite of just bun.  Psssh not at 25 Degrees! Now if you're not already full on burger- make sure you get some fries.  I ordered a small side of Sweet Potato Fries and was shocked at the amount that was poured on my plate for $2.  So. Many. Fries.  And damn were they good.   Among the best sweet potato fries I've had.  Next time I plan on trying the regular ol' fries, orrrrrr dragging someone else along so we can order a half/half basket.  :-) Of course when you're chowing down on a really awesome burger it helps if you're in an awesome environment and I loved the look and feel of the décor in 25.  It had this old vintage Victoria-house like quality to it.  There were tufted booths in dark maroon leather, traditional wallpaper around the whole space, and sparkly chandeliers above the bar.  I imagine on a Friday or Saturday night, despite being a burger joint, it's a really romantic spot to have a dinner w/ your boo.  Bottom line- excellent burger.  I love it when everything comes together.  25 Degrees is doing everything right and I can't wait to go back for another.",0.9985,0.783,0.175,0.042,0.5369389869389868

2014-01-10,2.0,"This is another place that seems to be experiencing an identity crisis.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is chic with the big leather booths and red velvet wallpaper - but with lots of tvs and sports.  If you use the Anthony Bourdain rule of judging a place by its bathroom then this one passes with an A.  But if you consider the TVs plus the 20something people working there are all in hoodies then you maybe confused.  If you're going for a chic burger bar then maybe up the uniforms and be more serious about the food and drink.  We had the Gilt City deal which got us 2 cocktails, 2 sides, 2 burgers and 1 spiked milkshake.  We started w/ the cocktails.  I got the bourbon drink with ginger and orange.  My boyfriend got a spiked soda - the cream soda.  Mine was ok but lacking personality.  It seemed more like a whiskey soda with orange made by a bartender at a Wrigleyville bar.  The cream soda was sweet and creamy and you could tell there was whiskey in there.  Then we got the burgers with a half/half order of french fries and onion rings.  We both got the #1 but I had it as a turkey burger with the bacon on the side.  We were told before we ordered onion rings that everything is made in-house.  Hmmm...my turkey burger was a perfectly round disc.  Like what I have in the freezer by Jenni O.  But this burger had been around for awhile.  It had that wet dog meat smell.  It hadn't gone bad but it was bad.  It baffles me because a turkey burger is just as easy and cheaper to make yourself.  Why do ""burger"" joints use frozen substitutes?  The fixin's on top were kind of slapped on there so one bit would be all gorgonzola and I think they maybe forgot the thousand island or if they didn't it was sparse.  There was just a little arugula that tasted great when you got to it.  Lucky for me I could only eat half so it wasn't a total diet-buster.  My boyfriend said his beef burger was just ok.  The fries were tasty and plentiful.  We had a few onion rings and they did seem to be made there.   We finished with the spiked milkshake.  My boyfriend loved it.  We got the salted caramel.  It is rich and creamy.  I definitely liked it but there were ice bits in it?  I felt more like it was a dessert cocktail than a milkshake.  Like I couldn't really tell if there was ice cream in there.  Nonetheless I was wishing for a spatula so I could get every molecule out.",0.9972,0.823,0.161,0.015,0.5377777777777779

Service was excellent.  I was the only person there eating, though there were three women perched at the long oval bar that takes up the center of the restaurant.  My server was quick to refill my water or pick up any clean plates.  My receipt says her name was Julia.  She was very friendly. I also loved the atmosphere of the place.  If Kuma's Corner is Slash from Guns 'n' Roses, 25 Degrees is Hugh Hefner.  (Young, cool Hef, not ancient, creepy sailor hat-wearing Hef.)  25 Degrees is dimly lit with dark seats and red, velvety wallpaper. For a bonus, pop into the restroom.  The men's room has black wallpaper with gold drawings of a woman in a bikini fleeing a cowboy with a knife.  Weird, but amusing. While I was in the restroom, I did notice one of the employees walk out without washing his hands, but it was 11:45, so it's not like he was going to prepare food.  At least, that's what I'm telling myself to preserve the positive impression of the place.

Pretty decent selection of drinks here and a fairly simple menu, yet not lacking in options.  The service was fantastic and our server (Jenifer K) was very informative and patient with us. The burgers are most definitely not worth the high prices, however they are not bad. The tuna burger is a bit too dry but the burger i got was cooked very well. While eating it, all i could think was that they are gourmet burgers in price and style but with a greasy taste.  The spiked shake was pretty darn good but i feel like it should be a bit stronger to make it worth the fun, otherwise i'd rather walk over to portfolios after dinner and grab an excellent regular milkshake.  I must say, the fries were so freaking addicting. Not sure what kind of oil they use or if its the oregeno (or whatever spice/herb they used) but they are awesome. I also love that they don't over batter the onion rings. They have some interesting and decent cocktails, i personally like mine stronger if i'm paying $11 for it but i guess its expected. I would not return with incentive strictly due to it not being worth the high prices (river north) on most of their food, however we had a Gilt City thing and it made it worth while.

I was so wrong and this ended up being the best thing about our visit! Unfortunately we had horrible customer service. We stood at the door for at least five minutes, maybe more, before a waitress even acknowledged us. Then she told us they were just clearing a table, but we continued to wait fifteen minutes. This usually wouldn't be a problem if that's what we were told but we would have gone somewhere else if we knew we would be standing that long. Also we were staring at empty tables while waiting. By the time we were seating I was falling asleep from standing so long. It seems like they may be very short-staffed and in need of someone to hostess and bus tables for better service and turnover. Even during our meal it felt like the waitresses were struggling to cover for each other and you felt guilty trying to get their attention for anything.  Also my date didn't really like his burger which was kind of the reason we went.

Excuse my French but F**K! I want to make sweet, sweet love to each one of the food items (with the exception of the salad, lol).  The burger was cooked to perfection, meat was slightly pink and was seasoned with magic crack dust, I'm convinced. It was delicious.  The dates were very good!!!

We scouted out the menu before and were dying to try their famous spiked milkshakes.  The decor inside was both fabulous and chic. Velvet patterned wallpaper mixed with dark woods and lovely chandeliers. Very romantic and elegant. We sat down in a booth and were met with friendly service.  I tried both the #2 and the #3 burgers. (We went halfsies) The #2 was a brilliant combination of ground beef and pesto. I would have never thought of putting pesto on a burger but oh my it was fantastic. The #3 (my personal fav) was a burger topped with chipotle queso and avocado. The bun was toasted yet soft, a combination that meshed well with the fun flavors of the burger.  Time for milkshakes. We split an Irish Car Bomb milkshake: chocolate ice cream with Baileys. Indescribable. Breathtaking.  I will definitely be making a return to 25 Degrees.

I was there for a private party.  There was a buffet in the back, along with servers walking around taking drink orders.  When I first got there, I was a little worried as it was kind of a cluster-f***.  The buffet lines were long, and as soon as the sliders came out of the kitchen, they were instantly gobbled up by people.  However, the staff was amazing dealing with the crowds and made sure everyone got to try all the burgers being passed around, to the point where I couldn't even look at the sliders anymore since I was so stuffed.  In addition to the awesome burgers (I think I have to go with the Pesto as my favorite), the wings were some of the best I've ever had (some kind of seseme-honey-bbq flavor).  For the drinks I had a Whiskey Smash (no brainer) and a couple prohibition style beers.  To top off the night they served some kind of alcoholic milkshake, which was ridiculous to say the least, and I'm not even really into drinks like that.

The wings were much better than expected. I thought they would be general bar wings with mediocre flavor but the skin was nice and crispy with a lot of flavor. The bacon wrapped dates were good, basically what you would expect from the name. The cheese balls were just alright, it's really just fried cheese so there's nothing amazing going on there. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 burgers were all tasty. I thought the number two burger I got could have been cooked a little more but the other two were cooked to perfection. The toppings all go well with the burgers and create some good flavor combinations. The milkshake blew me away. Wasn't expected the booze but it was a good surprise. The salty mixed with the caramel and the tons of whip cream on top made it a tasty treat.

I first had the honey-chili wings, which were pretty good, not too hot, not too sweet. The bacon wrapped dates, since it was so dark, and there was nobody to ask, I wasn't sure what it was I was eating, but it was delicious! So much so that I kept it in mind to look up on their menu online. The potato and 3 cheese fritters were a tad too salty for my taste, but it wasn't inedible or anything. Though the best part has got to be the burgers. I was able to try the #1, #2, and #3 and must say I wasn't disappointed by any of them. What's so great about them is the actual patty is deliciously seasoned, it's not just a hunk of beef topped with 20 different toppings to hide the lack of flavor in the burger patty like some places do. You really can't go wrong with either burger. Other than that, I just had a couple drinks and a caramel shake that I'd recommend as a good not too sweet, not too heavy way to end the meal.

Friend of mine with pretty high class taste recommended 25 degrees to me, so I thought I'd pop over and treat myself to what I assumed would be a expensive burger. I got there and it was a really cool place. Very comfortable and relaxing with the dimmed lights. I looked over the menu and was seriously surprised at the prices. The recommended burgers were only $12 and sounded amazing. I decided on a #1, but exchanged one of the cheeses for the aged sharp cheddar and got it medium rare. I saw some people eating fries and onion rings around me and thought I'd cough up the $4 for the half and half. Crazy prices. The burger is hands down the best burger I've ever had. Not being facetious, the quality was unreal. It was cooked perfectly. I only ate half the burger and completely destroyed the fries and onion rings. Ridiculously good. Over all, not counting tip, I paid $17.64 for the best burger I've ever had. The Onion rings were flawless. Not as blown away by the fries but they were still great. Seriously, check this place out. I'm very impressed.  Just a bit more info for the curious: aside from the numbers 1-4 you can build your own burger. Anywhere from $7-9 for which meat you like, $1 per topping and sauce, and $2 per cheese. They have quite the cheese list. Honestly a bit pretentious on the cheese but still very very good. If you try hard enough you can make a real expensive burger but over all, really cheap for what you're getting. Nice.",0.9957,0.721,0.223,0.056,0.6916805555555556

2013-10-25,3.0,"I'd previously been to 25 Degrees on three or four occasions, mostly for drinking. On one of those prior occasions, I had the misfortune of ordering their barkeep-touted onion rings, which came out with cooked batter and almost raw onions. Now, I've finally had occasion to try their vaunted burgers.  Verdict? Well, shame on me. This place is highly overrated and highly overpriced. Let's back up for a second. I was wondering what the name ""25 Degrees"" referred to and was just now thinking it either referred to some angle motif or possible 25 Degrees latitude or longitude. After five minutes of investigation, I figured neither was the source of the moniker and then went to their website. That's when I discovered 25 degrees is the difference in temperature between a raw burger and a well done burger. Remember this, kids, as there's going to be a test. 25 Degrees, there will be no test, but please have an in-house seminar to review what your name means. I ordered a sirloin burger and built my own burger from there, adding the complementary onion and pickle and the $1 bacon. I didn't add anything else. Do you want to know why? + Barbecue sauce as an added topping is $1 extra. + Cheese as an added topping is another $2 extra. Some of the cheeses are described as ""blue veiny."" Sorry, I'm not paying $2 extra for cheese, and I'm not putting anything that's ""blue veiny"" in my mouth.  That's madness. And that's how you end up paying $15 for a burger - and that doesn't even include fries and sauces are extra. For that price, I can go to Capital Grill and get a top notch burger, amazing fries and three sauces for the fries included.  Anyway, I ordered the burger medium well. Medium well is a dangerous temperature to like your burger cooked, as at least half of the time it's obviously mistranslated somewhere between my mouth, the server and the kitchen as medium rare. And this is where you're going to apply the math you learned above.  My burger came out about 15 degrees too cold. I would guess it came out somewhere between rare and medium rare, as there was plenty of red throughout the burger.  As far as taste, the burger was actually only okay. It just didn't have a distinctive taste like other burgers have, including one just down the street to the south.  As to the fries, they were basically Steak 'N Shake style and average. If you're ordering fries, you'll need no more than the small ($2) size for two people.   If you're looking for a better burger, do yourself a favor and head down the street to Portillo's. Just don't order fries at Portillo's because their fries suck.  Three stars.",0.9326,0.876,0.078,0.045,0.48022409839482993

Great burger, but I agree with previous reviewer that next time I'll build my own. Too many flavor to find the small one I didn't prefer so much.  Decided to split a large order of fries with my husband...we should've split a small because the large was huge and we couldn't finish half of them. Menu didn't say but they tastes like they were made garlic aioli.  We both only finished half our burgers as well.  The shakes....I'm usually not a fan of liquor and dairy products but the descriptions were so enticing I had to try one. Of course we went with the Salty Carmel. Yum!  Went on a Sunday after noon. Lots of the brunch crowd was still there winding down but we were seated quickly. Good music,  handful of tvs for sports fabs. Staff was friendly.

2013-08-18,4.0,"I've been here a couple times since I live nearby and I've had an enjoyable experience both times.  Outside is the bright and uncovered patio seating (limited to maybe six tables) and the huge contrast hits once you arrive inside. You immediately see burgundy faux-leather, tufted, half-moon booths flushed along a beautiful wall of velvet-textured wallpaper, dimly-lit chandeliers over each booth, and a wooden bar in the middle.  To get an idea of how child-friendly this place is, imagine all of the staff (other than the present manager) are women dressed in short-shorts and tank tops.  Honestly, I don't think I would bring children here.  Our waitress was kind and prompt in bringing our food out quickly and periodically asked if we needed anything, so service was perfect.  Also, if you let your server know that you're splitting one of the burgers, then the cook will halve it for you.  My beau and I ordered the brunch Norwegian Salmon and the Number One Burger (always cooked medium).  Our server informed us of the bottomless mimosas, bloody Mary's, and bellinis for $15, but I decided to be responsible on Sunday and declined - maybe it was the southern part of me that felt it was a right thing to do.  We received the Norwegian salmon first as the appetizer and it came out fairly quickly.  The dish was prepared with a thin spread of cream cheese at the base of the plate, topped with thinly sliced cured salmon, and topped with a heaping handful of arugula. Additionally, capers were placed on the white space sides of the appetizer plate alongside some crusty ciabatta bread.  Trust me when I say I love salty and sweet foods, but there is a line drawn from which I don't like to cross. Each prepared bite of the salmon with cream cheese, arugula, capers and bread was salt overboard.  Going forward, I'll play it safe and stay with ordering the burgers. Next came the Number One Burger (for brunch it comes with fries, but the regular lunch menu doesn't include fries). Boy, oh boy.  The fries came salted with finely chopped herb sprinkled on top. The burger had a shiny soft bun and was oozing with juices.  Minus the subtle herb taste, the fries truly reminded me of McDonald's fries - shape, saltiness, size, etc.  The burger had a thick and tender patty topped with arugula, caramelized onions, bacon and thousand island dressing.  I actually wish I built my own plain cheeseburger because there were too many different tastes from the additional ingredients within the burger to the point that I thought it was good, but you couldn't REALLY distinguish the different tastes.   On a different occasion, I've had the Salty Caramel spiked shake (made with Makers Mark, butterscotch vanilla ice cream, and Hawaiian Red Sea salt).  I drink occasionally, but I really enjoyed the spiked shake. It was akin to eating salted caramel ice cream alone and was a great treat with my meal.   All in all, I suggest ordering a burger paired with a shake (spiked or regular) to get the best experience out of your visit.

Is it really that hard to run a restaurant well?  Not for these guys.  I find myself craving the next visit, and again, I am not a burger guy.",0.7377,0.877,0.085,0.039,0.5483796296296296

The building is on the smaller side, but the bar/hipster/garage/urban feeling was very appropriate for the intimate seating. When I order a burger, I need to eat it with fries, generally speaking. That's just me. I'd like to get out of the way the fact that these fries were nothing special, but did their job. I would probably order them again just because that is my nature, but wouldn't rave about them.    On to the fun part: I ordered the number one burger (sans cheese) so it had caramelized onions, arugula, bacon, and thousand island dressing. Alone, these are some of the best ingredients to work with--the sweet onions, peppery arugula, salty/sweet bacon, and rich/tangy dressing each bring a lot to the table, literally. But when united atop a perfectly cooked, juicy (but not runny), well-seasoned ground sirloin jewel, the result was absolutely one of the most intimate pleasures I have ever experienced. To push this burger over the edge, the sweet and buttery bun that held these explosive flavors captive won best supporting component to this masterpiece.     Our waitress was very attentive, answering all of our questions, and even bringing samples of cheese to the table upon request (they have quite the selection). After the meal, I filled out a survey and received an email for 25% off my next bill.

We had 2 veggie burgers, one turkey and one beef (ground sirloin), everyone was very happy with theirs. Our waitress was very helpful when we described what kind of cheese we wanted. I also said I wanted jalapeno and bacon, she offered the bacon that was soaked in jalapenos, trying to save me the extra $1, which was very nice.

They stop making them about an hour or so before closing cuz it's made in the kitchen. I settled for a float before leaving and it's pretty darn good.

We had a great time catching up, and it was loud, but not so loud that we couldn't hear each other. The vibe they're going for confuses me a bit. Is it loungey? If so, why does it smell overwhelmingly like stale beer? Our waitress was friendly but not super attentive - the restaurant doesn't really have that many tables. It was funny because it took the same amount of time for our waitress to take our food order that it took for us to actually get our food! We thought that was strange.  The burger itself wasn't great. Maybe it's my fault for getting it medium - it seemed undercooked (this might be my fault!). The bacon was virtually nonexistent and almost tasted undercooked and chewy. The chipotle sauce didn't pack much of a flavor punch. I definitely wondered where both toppings were when beginning to eat the burger! I ate about half of it. The fries were better than average but not by much. They didn't really stand out. The bananas foster milkshake was definitely inventive and delicious. If anything, it was almost too rich, but I don't exactly drink milkshakes a lot.

After looking at the menu I needed to ask our waitress some questions on the cheeses and sauces-She was helpful and I took her advice so I ordered the Sirloin, with the Peppercorn cheese and a side of the Chiptole sauce for my fries- Asked for it to be cooked Medium- Asked for a Coke, was shocked to see a fountain drink for $4...but I can't complain b/c it was perfect syrup/soda water mix and I got refills without even asking :) Food came out in 5 minutes- I was worried my burger would be dry, but that was not the case-Juicy, the cheese was creamy and the bun was warm and buttery, so freaking good-As well the fries were tasty; thin with seasoning-I think next time I'll get a different sauce and cheese, want to experiment with all they offer- As well I want to try their spiked milkshakes, was too full to do so this time so there will be a next-",0.8936,0.845,0.102,0.053,0.475

2012-08-20,4.0,"If there are two classes of burgers, the fast food & gourmet, there should now be three. An incredible presentation of beef, vegetable and roll made this more than just a burger. Set just south of the Rush St. corridor, this swanky little place does not disappoint. When they say the have the ""best fries"", I'm like, whatever, they're just fried potatoes. But they turn them into little slivers of gold that taste fantastic. Our server Lauren was friendly, attentive, and quick, but not over the top on anything.  The spiked milkshake was really good. Not too sweet, like I was worried about. They need longer straws, though, as your choice is either leave the last 1/4 in the cup, get whipped cream on your nose trying to use the too short to straw work the bottom sips out, or drink it straight from the glass, and still get whipped cream all over your face. I left 1/4 in the glass. The wing appetizer was high quality; lots of meat, and a good tangy sauce.",0.9704,0.82,0.149,0.031,0.5135087719298246

He told me I should come back and try some of their food another time.  I went back last night. Melanie was behind the bar and took care of me this time. Another great bartender at this great little place! I did have The Number Three with Turkey (aka turkey burger). It was one of the best I've ever had! The sweet potato fries were delicious too. Drinks were very good pours on both occasions. The music was incredible. Exactly what I was in the mood for. The DJ/Video DJ came on at 10pm and he was great too.

2012-08-16,4.0,"During my search to find bottomless mimosas & bloody mary's for our annual girls' weekend trip to Chicago, I came across 25 Degrees. Of course, I was most excited about these spiked milkshakes.  Last Saturday, we arrived with some heavy hangovers. I was surprised to find that 25 Degrees didn't open until 11am, unlike a lot of bars in Detroit that serve brunch. Staff was really pleasant and did a great job. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with a side of potatoes. The sandwich had a fried egg, bacon, lettuce & tomato on thick slices of toast. The potatoes were in patty form, and mixed with cheese and spices. All of it was delicious. It absolutely helped my hangover. I'm guessing the bottomless mimosas helped too. She brought a full bottle of champagne, with a little jug of orange juice. That's my kind of bottomless mimosa! My friends enjoyed their meals as well, but I can't remember what they had! Unfortunately, I did not order a spiked milkshake. I just couldn't fit it in.  We went back the next morning with the intention of trying the spiked milkshake. Plus, my friend was less hungover and really wanted to enjoy the lemon ricotta pancakes. This experience was not so good. Our waitress was either new or just really bad. She was very sweet, but oh my...she needs help. We got there shortly after they opened, and it wasn't busy. Our waitress would take our drink order, then we wouldn't see her for awhile. It just took a long time for anything. We had to grab another waitress several times for more coffee, cream, etc. My friend saw a dish that she thought was something else. She tried to explain what she thought it was, but I think there was a big communication failure between the waitress & my friend. So, what my friend got was not what she thought it was. It was very spicy, mexican dish with tortilla chips & eggs. She did not like it, but admitted it was her own fault. The rest of us enjoyed our meals and the coffee was really good.  The good part about this not-so-great experience was that the manager was all over it. She came out a couple of times to check on us. When she realized that my friend didn't like her dish, she took it off the bill, and gave her a gift card for her next visit. We didn't have any attitude about the service or the dish, and didn't actually complain (we were asked if we liked our dishes). I thought this was great customer service and went above and beyond.  Sadly, I still didn't order a spiked shake. I was so full, I just couldn't imagine drinking a shake. Too bad I couldn't take it to go! Next year, I will have this spiked shake!  The staff is very friendly, food is great, and loved the seating outside. I would definitely be a regular here if I lived in Chicago.",0.9941,0.743,0.174,0.083,0.49517821572367043
2012-08-06,3.0,"Overall this place could be 4 stars, but my beef (pun intended) is the fact that when asked for gluten free options, or rather what sauces may contain gluten, they simply had no clue. It is easy enough to know that buns aren't gluten free, but not so much with fancy chef created sauces. All I am saying is they should at least be aware of the ingredients. My wife has a sensativity so a little gluten is only uncomfortable, but I have a couple friends that would have to be rushed to the ER. Bottom line, if you have gluten issues, this place is not accomodating. Other than that the food is solid, and the menu for restaurant week had a good selection. Wings, dates, and fries were all good. Easily 4 stars with a little more education for the staff. Oh, the staff was friendly and did well.",0.9871,0.739,0.225,0.036,0.5324404761904762

The fries and onion rings were all right, but I have had better at almost every burger place I've been to. The burgers were pretty good (I crafted my own, and others had the #1, 2, and 3 which they said were above average as well). Portion sizes were great. I had the Redhead in Bed drink, as it was on special. My boyfriend had two Maydays, which he loved, along with my drink. Highlight of the meal was my spiked Salty Caramel milkshake. It was AMAZING, creamy butterscotch with Makers Mark. My friend also had the Banana Foster one which was good but very boozy. On a positive note, I did love the decor. Chandeliers and dark wood, deep red velvet wallpaper.  I might return if a friend wanted to check it out, but I wouldn't go back on my own. I hate to say it, but Kuma's Corner blows this place away burger-wise. The 3 stars is for the milkshake.",0.9955,0.688,0.266,0.046,0.5643896103896104

2012-07-08,2.0,"It was laughable. Service was extremely poor. I'll elaborate later. Was very excited to try this place given the Chicago Tribune review this past week, but I will sadly not be returning.  Here's a recap: was excited that they let you get a half & half side, so you can try onion rings and fries...I was sad to learn that neither of their fries (regular or sweet potato) are hand cut, but I went with the waiter's recommendation of sweet. My wife ordered the vegetable salad and then we both ordered burgers, mine medium rare, hers medium.  All of the food arrived at pretty much the same time; the sides and salad minutes before our burgers came. The salad looks nice, with fresh, crunchy vegetables and the perfect amount of blue cheese but that was the only palatable food received. This salad and the fact that they serve Laguanitas' Sumpin Sumpin earn them an extra star. The onion rings and fries were presented on the same plate with the fries in some sort of chinese food takeout container. There was a giant pool of grease underneath the onion rings so I knew they wouldn't be edible. The batter was falling off the greasy onions. I attempted to pick one up but the flimsy, greasy onion disintegrated into my fingers. Disgusting! the sweet potato fries were OK. The same brand served at the East Bank Club only soggier. My wife's burger was a hockey puck. As was mine. No trace of pink or juice in either. She feels bad about sending food back, but when paying for a $15 dollar burger, it needs to be made again. I sent mine back and it was cooked medium rare. I did like the combination of the cheeses but the 1000 island was overpowering, the caramelized onions were more steamed that caramelized, and the bacon wasn't noticeable under the pile of arugala. The service was bad. Our waiter only came over to take our order, once to check on us before I had even taken a bite out of my burger, a 3rd time to ask if I wanted another beer while I was waiting for my burger remake, and a final time with the check. He didn't offer dessert, refills on water, or anything that would have displayed an attention to customer service. I honestly don't even think he knew that I needed another burger. A random floor employee took my burger back to the kitchen while our waiter was MIA and brought me a new one, which was nice, but it would have been nice to receive some type of acknowledgement from a manager while I had to sit and watch my wife eat her overcooked burger and stare at the pile of grease underneath our sides. With tip, the meal came to $60. I feel like I've been robbed. Maybe I'm just critical but I don't understand the hype about this place and all of the positive feedback thus far. It's a lousy, overpriced, ordinary restaurant.",0.98,0.799,0.124,0.077,0.5819545234639574

First of all....the space is clubby enough to pacify the snooty hipster...but low brow enough to make the Bud drinker in your crowd smile.  The outdoor spills into the indoor....so grab the table just inside the door on a hot day...and you will feel like you are outside but get a cool back massage from the AC.  The floorplan is set up like an old time bar (U shaped in the middle)....so combine that with the retro modern velvet walls and you have the perfect setting for your evening.  Who said its how you finish?  I started with a ""Drunken Shake"" (Salted Caramel) that had me wondering....""why didnt someone think of this before"".  Makers Mark, Haagen Dazs vanilla, butterscotch and hawaiian red sea salt.  I havent had my ""WOW"" gauge pegged past the ""we're going to blow"" mark in quite some time....but this was ""desert island, last meal, if I only could eat one thing the rest of my life"" kind of culinary magic.  I think I sucked it down in four sips.... The burgers were outstanding....I had a Yellowfin Tuna sammy on a pretzel roll with spicy aioli and it was perfect.  The fries and onion rings were top notch.    They also have TVs is you want to chill on game night.....but one thing that kept me from giving it five stars was....the menu is a bit limited.  No chicken.  I would expect a burger place to have regular buffalo wings (they only have sweet chili foo foo something) and maybe a chicken sandwich.   They also dont have PBR ....aside from that...they were PERFECT.  Take a bow, 25 degrees....welcome to the neighborhood.  Bravo....",0.9816,0.84,0.119,0.04,0.5089157089157088
2012-07-02,4.0,"Hyper-trendy burger bar. Pricey, but the food backs it up.  I've been here a few times now. Obviously I like it because I go back.  I'm a sucker for all the goodies to customize your meat. If you're in for a plain cheeseburger, don't come here, because you won't find it. Most recently I tried the Detroit St. Brick with jalapeno bacon. Interesting combination with the goat cheese that really paid off. Peppercorns and Jalapenos with the creamy goat cheese seemed to like each other.  Having been here a few times now, I've decided the extra sauces for $1 are plain ridiculous.  We ordered an appetizer that came with garlic mayo, so I hung on to the leftover of that and put some on my burger, but otherwise, the toppings and cheese will provide so much flavor that either the sauce will take over or the rest or get lost in the mix.  If you're not careful, you can find yourself a $20 burger with no effort at all.  The fries are fantastic here. I've also had the Guinness shake. It was really good, although I feel like they could've put a little more Guinness in and it'd be perfect.  Suggestion for 25, change it up! It'd be nice to see a ""cheese of the month"" or ""burger of the week"" or something to stir up some new tastes and ideas.  The menu hasn't changed since I first went.

I have a pretty big appetite but after a salted caramel shake (which was to die for) and a very healthy helping of the fries & onion rings (called the Half n Half order) I could only eat half of my huge burger, so I took the rest to go. The onion rings were great. They were so big and crispy and the onion didn't come out when you bit into it, so that was a bonus. The bottom bun of my burger did get a little soggy from the huge juicy patty, but I really didn't mind because it was so good. I ordered the pesto burger and it was so delish! My bf created his own burger with bbq sauce, sauteed onions, pickles and cheddar cheese. Their pickles look freshly made there! The whole experience was great.

All three times, I also sampled the sweet potato fries and onion rings.  I have to preface this by saying that it is entirely possible that the third time, I caught them on a bad night. After all, it was late on a Saturday night (probably 10pm). In addition, the sweet potato fries and onion rings are consistently delicious. OK, now for the bad part - the most recent time I went, instead of prosciutto on my burger, there was some really thick, slimy, greyish-colored strips of something that was very chewy and DISGUSTING. I am still trying to reassure myself that maybe it was undercooked bacon or something... but it really was unidentifiable to both myself and my husband.

Looking at the menu, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted. I did the Create-Your-Own with a turkey burger, caramelized onions, bacon, and pleasant ridge cheese. It was a big burger and the combination of ingredients made me devour every last bite of it. And I don't usually finish a burger that big... My friend got the No. 4, the tuna burger and other things I can't remember. I do remember it having a bit of a spicy kick due to the aioli, I think?  My friend and I planned on sharing fries, so I ordered a large size of sweet potato fries. When they say large, they mean a huge ass order. I think the portion was good enough size 4+ people. Sheesh. We worked on it for a while...or I should say, he did most of the eating.  I was debating on getting a milkshake to wash down meal. They have non-alcoholic ones and spiked ones (drool). Then I saw the 25 degrees margarita, which just called out to me. It was very sweet and perfect for a hot day. My friend and I got our burger fix that weekend. As we were leaving, an empty booth looked inviting as I wanted to curl up and take a post-burger nap.",0.989,0.805,0.163,0.032,0.5458057280883368
2012-06-01,5.0,I thought some other burger joints in Chicago had it down...but 25 degrees is the sleeper of burger joints... the burgers here are DELICIOUS! The bun is soft and goes well with the entire burger. The patty was cooked perfectly and the toppings are awesome here. The combination on each burger works extremely well together. The portions of fries are huge and more than enough. I wish I knew about the spiked shakes cause I would've gotten one. But there's an excuse to go back at least!!! Service was also excellent. And great beer selection.  Will be back!,0.9855,0.721,0.279,0.0,0.590625

I had to have a spiked milkshake, it's 5 o'clock somewhere even if it was only 11:30am here.  The Turkish Latte was awesome; Bailey's, espresso, coffee ice cream and cardamom.  The hubby went with the house margarita, made to order...that's right no pre-made mixes here.  Boy could I tell the difference.  So fresh and flavorful, I could taste the smooth tequila followed by lime and agave.  I built my own turkey burger, adding some bacon and smoked Gouda and all I could say was this is freaking amazing.  The hubby did a regular cow burger similar style.  We shared a side of sweet potato fried, my favorite kind of fries.

2012-05-28,1.0,"Cool Place, Good ingredients, Terrible Food.  I just ate here and had such bad food I joined Yelp.   I live in the neighborhood and have been going to the local restaurants and had heard good things about 25 degrees (Yelp has it at 4 stars), so I tried it out.  I was starving when I got here and ordered the #3, which sounds great when you read it, a beer (no complaints here), and a beet salad.   First the beet salad: the arugula was too salty, the beets didn't have much flavor and  the burrata was out of place.  Simply put the salad didn't taste good. Onto the #3: It is a huge burger on an even bigger bun.  After a couple of bites I realized something was missing, flavor.  The beef, although a generous portion, was not seasoned.  The avocado on top, and I love avocado, didn't work with any of the flavors (or add anything to the burger).  The sauce just added calories, no flavor whatsoever.   The grand total of this experience was a salty salad, a huge, bland, burger and a cool, crisp beer to help wash down the food and the feeling of wasting money on the food ($60+ for 2 burgers, 2 salads, and 2 beers). If you want a good burger at a good price (or just a good burger), I would go elsewhere.",0.9783,0.728,0.195,0.077,0.5584838533114396

The number one (caramelized onion, prelibato gorgonzola crescenza, bacon, arugula, thousand island) and number three (mezzo secco jack, green chili, chipotle, avocado) were brilliant. Nice soft but substantial bun. Thick patty cooked to your preference. Great combination of toppings that don't overwhelm the meat. The burgers tasted even better than they look in the pictures. The sweet potato fries were good, not as good as DMK Burger Bar though. Like DMK, the fries do not come with the burger. They have many dipping sauces you can add to your burger or fries. I recommend the garlic aioli. The spiked milkshakes and grilled cheese have been mentioned by food publications so I'll have to try those next time. The decor reminded me of a sports bar because there are a couple TVs above the bar but also a diner because of the booth type seating. Service was very friendly and efficient. Prices for the preset burgers are a reasonable $12. If you create your own burger and add many toppings, your burger will probably be a little more expensive. Their list of cheese options for burgers is the largest I've seen in Chicago. The number one burger at 25 Degrees in now one of my top 3 favorite burgers.

The waiter was very helpful and gave me great giving suggestions on which cheese and other toppings would compliment my choice. The cheese selection is awesome.

2012-05-05,2.0,"First of all, this is not a burger joint. This is a late night bar and brunch spot that happens to serve burgers. If this was a true burger joint-type establishment, they would have their full menu of burgers available all day. Instead, if you were hoping to try anything other than one choice of burger around lunch time on Saturday or Sunday, sorry. You'll have to wait till brunch ends at 2pm before being granted access to anything besides the Number One burger. As for the Number One burger: What I liked: I'd say the fact that the fries has fresh oregano on them was interesting? Is that even a positive? What I didn't like: Besides the extremely limited lunch-time selection of burgers from a purported burger restaurant, almost everything about the Number One burger was poor. The burgers both my girlfriend and I received were both overcooked, mine somehow more so than hers. The beef was overly dry and mealy in consistency. Any beefy flavors that might have been present were easily overwhelmed by the heavy handed addition of  enough Thousand Island dressing to make the oversized brioche bun slide right off. Not a bad thing because with the super high bun-to-burger ratio, you'll probably end up removing half the bun anyway, unless you are a bread lover. The bacon was surprisingly tasteless and rubbery, refusing any attempts to be bitten through cleanly. And the gorgonzola was totally overpowering. The texture of the cheese combined with the bready brioche roll and dry patty had me chugging my $8 beer to keep from choking. Which leads me to another point: two burgers with fries and a beer each ran up a $40 lunch--sorry, brunch--tab. Burger lovers, purists, or anyone else should avoid this place. There are better and much more affordable options for burgers in the city. In fact, you can walk west a few blocks to Big & Little's to get one of the better burgers Chicago has to offer for roughly half the price.",0.9681,0.813,0.126,0.06,0.5200655363155364
2012-05-03,5.0,"Love. This place is fantastic. I don't know exactly what they do to the veggie burgers to make them so moist and flavorful, but I'm fine with not knowing - they are easily the best veggie burgers I have ever had... and as a long-time veggie-burger-loving vegetarian, I consider myself something of an expert! Do not miss their amazing sweet potato fries, either. And obviously, you must try the drinks (per everyone else's suggestions...), although I am something of a creature of habit so I haven't managed to work my way all the way through the drink menu just yet... but given my frequent cravings for their veggie burgers, I'm sure I will have plenty of opportunity in the near future!

2012-05-02,2.0,"The food was decent. My husband and I have been there twice. We got burgers and fries the first time, and milkshakes and chicken wings the second. No complaints about the food, it was delicious. But were the milkshakes worth $6? No. Was my burger worth $14. No.  Overall, we really did like the food, but the negative review both times was due to the experience. The first time, we made the mistake of going on a Friday night at 10p.m. We walked in, and a party of three walked in a few minutes after us. The party of three was seated in the first open booth available (clearly a good fit for 3 people, but nonetheless, we got there first so it should've been ours.) We ended up waiting for an extra 20 minutes at the bar for our table. The party of three had their food before we got a table. That was stupid. Not to mention, the place was super loud and we couldn't even hear each other over all of the loud music and yelling. I realize some people like the loud restaurant scene, but that wasn't really our thing. We resolved to give the place a second chance on a weeknight, maybe even happy hour? So, I thought I had read online that they have half priced milkshakes from 3-6 all week long. We went in, got our milkshakes and ordered the chili-honey wings as well. When we got the bill, the milkshakes were not half off, and neither the waiter nor the manager seemed to care that we came TO the restaurant for this alleged happy hour. In fact, when we brought it up, the manager made me feel really stupid, he said, ""No, we've never ever offered that. I don't know where you found that. That's never been on our menu."" Okayy...so I double checked at home and sure enough, it was only for the Hollywood location. My bad, but I didn't appreciate the confrontational ""you're absolutely wrong"" treatment from the manager.  Anyway, after all of that, I would much rather go to The Hop Haus for a $10 gourmet burger, MUCH better fries, and much friendlier service. And I would rather go to M Burger or Chick-fil-a for an equally delicious and much, much cheaper milkshake.",0.9901,0.75,0.168,0.082,0.47294685990338153
2012-04-29,3.0,25 degrees definitely hit the spot but I am seldom disappointed with a gourmet burger.  The mix of fries and rings were great even though the giant rings were a little soggy.  The catalyst was their selection of crazy alcohol infused shakes and floats.  I've tried both the Salted Caramel with Makers Mark and the Guinness Shake that were equally amazing.  The next table over had some kind of Dreamsicle float with booze in it that I have to try next time.   The difference between 3 & 4 stars came from diverging from my usual.  I didn't really feel like a burger (probably shouldn't have gone to a burger place) so I tried their #4 Tuna Burger.  It was a ground tuna patty that was a little dry and lacking the flavor of everything else I've had.,0.8722,0.829,0.114,0.058,0.5535714285714286

The food was spectacular as well...all courses we got :) -Breakfast Sandwich - First it comes on a pretzel bun...right away I was happy!  All the flavors go together so well in this sandwich...def recommend. -French Toast - my friend got this and it looked really good (I'm not a huge sweets for breakfast fan)...she said it was delish. -Jalapeno bacon - So so good.  It has a great kick at the end.  Try it and thank me. -Bacon wrapped dates - On our first visit my buddy and I wanted to try them but didn't bc we figured they couldn't compare to Babareeba - WRONG.  They were so good with the goat/ricotta cheese inside.  One recommendation would be to wrap with jalapeno bacon...that would be awesome. -Tuna Burger - Around hour 5 we thought we might need some food to soak up the 3 bottles of champagne we had consumed so we split this burger.  I will admit I was hesitant and would have been good with a regular burger...once again wrong.  It was a delish combination of flavors!

The bun is perhaps the best thing about this burger; pillowy and soft, just the right size. The toppings were good but did not overpower the delicious meat. My biggest gripe was with the fries; hot and crispy, but perhaps a bit overcooked and very oddly seasoned.  Pricing is standard for this kind of burger ($12 for the specialty options).

I went with their #1 burger, my dining companion made her own from their pick your own selections.  Burgers cooked correctly, really good buns, toppings fresh and tasty.  A little more seasoning would have made it really outstanding. We each had a beer, they are craft beer focussed. Sides, we picked a ""half & half""; onion rings and fries.  O rings were tasty (though some lacked a crispness to the coating), fries were unremarkable...but still good.

I can't.  25 Degrees at 11 pm on a Saturday night is simply not for me.   I'm self actualized enough to know my limits.  I know I'm not an evil troll, but I also know that I don't fall into the category of a super-stylish, polished and trendy person.  Hence, I do not fit in at 25 Degrees. I knew I was in trouble when I walked in to ""thump thump"" music booming through the speaker systems.  It was compounded when I saw nothing but dudes in their boat shoes and designer denim who introduce themselves as traders with gelled hair.  Even more cementing my uncomfortableness (is that a word?) were the bevy of women with bleached hair, ultra-expensive shoes and outfits that cost more than my entire summer wardrobe combined.

They have a nice selection of floats, sodas, shakes, etc that are made ""adult"" with the addition of liquor.  Lots of options, though I didn't try anything.  App: Spicy Tuna with Crispy Eggplant-- Presentation was excellent, very colorful. Taste was ok, couldn't really enjoy the taste of the fish because there was an overpowering abundance of ginger. The sauce that was used to decorate the plate was delicious, some sort of soy/teriyaki mix.  Salad: 1/2 beet salad. I'm not a huge fan of beets, more because I usually don't eat them, but figured I'd try to beet salad.  Presentation wise- the whole plate simply looked red, no contrast at all. Other dinners had ordered the chopped salad, which basically looked like the beet salad because it was full of beets. Didn't really eat too much of the beet salad, but if you like beets, you'd probably enjoy it.  Entree: Sirloin burger with jack/avocado (number 3), the burger was cooked perfectly! Also, it was extremely juicy. The bun was soft as can be and honestly one of the best hamburger buns I've tasted in a while. As stated earlier, the portions were huge and the burger was monstrous. If I didn't fill up on apps and salad, the burger itself would have been a great, filling meal on its own.  Side: French fries (side of pesto sauce). The fries were cut thin, kind of like ""Steak and Shake."" I really enjoyed them, cooked well and seasoned appropriately. The side sauce was also tasted, with a nice burst of basil flavor.  Dessert: Red Velvet Cupcake. Presentation wasn't exactly appetizing, looked as if the cupcake was really ""doughy"" in the middle, almost undercooked, but I think that was the style as other diners had similar looking cupcake. Even with the ""raw-like"" texture, the cupcake wasn't half-bad. I'd prefer to have more of the ""red velvet flavor"" shine though, thought it was limiting in that aspect.

2012-02-23,3.0,"A-OK burgers set in a backdrop of deep and dark red and black interior. For a little while, I thought I was unintentionally caught in the midst of a very merry Jersey Shore dinner. Apparently I didn't get the memo about hair bumping and slim black one-pieces. We were sitting pretty cozily along the side, where I felt like I was rubbing elbows with people sitting on both ends. While we agreed to having a trainee server, we were a little confused as to why we were approached by three different people-- I suppose there was a lack of communication on their end.   While this was a Restaurant Week participant, there was no mention of their offerings or a drop of their RW menu. In retrospect It worked out for the best because we didn't want to drag it out for more than one course. Made my own: Turkey, gruyere, arugula, chiles, fried egg, garlic aioli with a small side order of seasoned sweet potato fries. While it was nice that it came wrapped, I would've preferred that I topped my own bun. The burger was soggy. The fried egg should've been on top of everything else. Otherwise, it was smushed by the cheese and blurred into an oblivion with the chiles and wet arugula. What's the point of ordering a fried egg if I can't see it drenched in its risky salmonella-induced deliciousness? The only saving grace was the gruyere which was melted oh-so-wonderfully. The sweet potato fries complemented well and was A-OK, but not something I would go out of the way for another encounter.",0.9112,0.873,0.093,0.034,0.5418269230769232

We sat at the bar & our server/bartender was awesome - very nice & helpful since it was our first time there.  I have to put some blame on the kitchen staff though.  Since we ordered off the RW menu we got an appetizer, salad, burger, and side...and they all came out within less than 2 minutes of each other.  Didn't care for the timing of dinner...would have liked the app & salads first, then wait a bit for the burgers & sides.

This place looks really nice and not at all like the whorehouse I wanted it to be. But it was new then. I forgive them. What we found was a garage door open to the street at 6pm on a Wednesday. We got the table next to the open air and had one of the most fun dining experiences I had in the summer, back when it was still quiet inside and beautiful outdoors. This is clearly not a bar food kind of burger place, but in River North you're more likely to find the 25 Degrees upmarket kind to begin with. Their toppings list is extensive - if you can name the kind of cheese, it's likely it's on the list. They get soggy, but they come in this really precious paper wrapping that seems so cute until you accidentally get a thin layer of it in your mouth and confuse it for bun. Sweet potato fries were unbelievable. I don't like bourbon. I ordered a maker's mark shake anyway. This is my fault, and I can't judge it, but I probably would've been much happier with guinness and chocolate because mine was really, really heavy-handed on the booze. I've heard they toned them down and I'm betting they are much less cocktail (and much more shake) these days. Really want to try it again, but can't imagine going when it's so cold and awful here.

So I came here when the place was pretty new in September and have been back a couple of times.  The first visit was early for an dinner on a Wednesday, so it wasn't busy at all.  And it was warm enough that they had the garage door open which was wonderful.  The burger was meaty, and I love that they have so many cheese options.  The burger comes out wrapped in some paper, which is helpful, because the bottom bun seems to disintegrate before you can eat the entire thing.  But the salted caramel milkshake was FANTASTIC.  I am a bourbon-lover, so I appreciated the fact that it was super bourbon-y.  It was a bit too strong for my friend, so I ended up finishing hers.  We also shared a plate of sweet potato fries with the garlic aioli sauce, and by shared I mean gobbled up every single fry to the point where we were both disgustingly full.  I recently was here for dinner on a Friday, and my experience was not as great but still not bad.  It was busy, so our order got mixed up as did the table's next to us.  My friend ordered soup which came out maybe 3 minutes before our burgers.  Once we did get our burgers, the toppings between ours were mixed up.  The food was still good, though.  I had the salted caramel milkshake again, and it seemed toned down.  It was not up-in-your-face bourbon-y like before.   I'll probably come back again on a weeknight or for lunch when it's less busy, because the food has been consistently good and the staff is nice (especially the owner, who came over and talked to us during my first visit).",0.9892,0.831,0.148,0.022,0.47915094165094163

Next up our burgers.  Now we both like our burgers pretty simple so it was a basic cheeseburger for the both of us, the only difference being the kind of cheese but there are plenty of ""reciped"" burgers with interesting names and toppings to choose from.  I also had noted on my Foursquare check in , that I could get a small order of fries for FREE so we had that as well.   My burger was fine but definitely more med rare than medium.  And my friend's burger had to go back as it was rare and bloody rather than the medium that was also ordered.  The owner, Joe, saw that we were having some issues and immediately rectified the situation, which was nice.  He then continued to check back in on us as the night went on to make sure we had what we needed.  Seems our server, although nice and friendly, was new and was finding her way the night we were there so it was nice to have the extra set of eyes.  Turns out the owners family also owns the Red Robin hamburger chain in Michigan so they are well versed in customer satisfaction. The decor of 25 Degrees was really nice.  Warm, welcoming with a bit of a vintage feel to it.  The walls are papered in deep rose colored coverings, the big cozy booth we sat in was a dark leather and the vintage crystal chandeliers added a novelty touch.  And the biggest surprise was the spacious, and well lit bathroom. All in all a pretty nice place to drink some wine, enjoy a burger and catch up with friends.   Dinner for two with wine and appetizers ran about $75.

We were shown to a cozy booth and a waitress stopped by with a cocktail menu.  I rejected it knowing I had a work project to complete in the afternoon.  Melanie had no such restrictions and without hesitation ordered a beverage that caught her eye. Her cocktail looked very refreshing when it was delivered.  Melanie let me sample it and with one sip I was hooked: I too had to have a redhead in bed. Strawberry puree was muddled with Ketel One Citroen vodka and Mumm Napa sparkling wine. It was so good! I liked my burger too.  It tended more to the rare side, but was tasty. The combination of toppings added a welcome dimension to it. Having imbibed with my meal, I decided to take the afternoon off and make the lunch a leisurely one. I had to sacrifice a Sunday to catch up on my project, but I have no regrets. I would jump at the chance to get another redhead in bed.",0.7751,0.853,0.087,0.06,0.641208791208791
2011-11-26,4.0,"Went there last night, love the sexy sports bar atmosphere, perfect for any date night. Love the adventurous menu, I had the number 3. I like that they had a fish and turkey burger option, and all the burgers come on brioche. I'm hugest fan of sauces, the menu had 13 different sauces, and 13 different cheeses. The service was VERY QUICK, and our waitress very attentive. The food was pretty tasty I give it a 4.5 out of 5.  The reason why I gave 4 stars, is because the bartender could learn to make a better cocktail. The strawberries in the RED HEAD IN BED cocktail weren't muddled thoroughly, and I'm very sure my Ketel One Cosmo was made with Grey Goose, which resulted in my hangover his morning.  fyi: Best sweet potato fries and onion rings, not too thick or greasy. The prices are pretty amazing too, fries $2, and build a burger starting at $8.",0.9931,0.726,0.274,0.0,0.621031746031746
2011-11-21,4.0,"It seems like every other day a fancy new hamburger joint is opening in Chicago. I'm not sure if this phenomenon speaks to Chicagoans never ending desire for $15 hamburgers, or just a lack of creativity from restaurant owners.   Enter into the fray 25 degrees. My boo and I visited on a Sunday night, hungry for a good burger and 25 degrees delivered. A part from a few pre-made burger options, 25 degrees provides you with a huge list of toppings and sauce options and lets you go wild. I opted for a burger with bacon, egg, chipotle sauce and an amazingly smooth cheddar cheese whose name I forget. The burger came out a perfect medium and was juicy and full of bold flavor. I have to say, this may become one of my favorite burger spots downtown. 25 degrees also has a unique cocktail menu featuring variations on classic soda shop staples. I tried a cream soda made with Makers Mark, vanilla liquor and ginger ale. That sucker packed a punch, believe me. My boo had their orange soda which tasted like a better version of a screwdriver. Because I'm a foodie and a fatty, I also had to try an alcoholic shake for desert. I had one with caramel, Makers Mark, sea salt and whip cream and I drank it up quicker than the Nestle Quick Rabbit.  Shakes that get you buzzed. What's not to like? I liked 25 degrees. They offered up a fancy burger, but unlike similar places in Chicago, they actually delivered on the quality as well. Adding a great cocktail list to an already good burger, and I can definitely see myself coming back here. Great for burgers and sweet tooth cravings.",0.987,0.806,0.155,0.039,0.56613455988456
2011-11-14,4.0,"My friend and I didn't really have high hopes for this place, our hearts are firmly set at Kuma's Corner. We had the mistake (for sports fans it'd be ok), but the Bears game had started right as we walked in. And the 15-20 people there were.. Well let's just say a little overenthusiastic during the game.  Our waiter (I don't remember his name unfortunately) was very  helpful from drink selections (He said the Salty Caramel was his favorite adult shake) and selecting Cheeses and Sauces (Also excellent suggestions)!, I had a taste of the shake, and it was good (even though I'm not a fan of Makers Mark). I ordered a Craft your own with Bacon, Egg, and Hooks Cheddar Cheese. My Friend ordered a Craft your own with jalapeno Bacon, Egg, Mushroom, and Cheddar Cheese with a hint of Blu and Sugar Crystals (I forget the name). Both burgers were ordered medium rare. We also ordered a Half and half with Fries and Onion rings. The burgers arrived perfectly cooked. The only complaint we had together is the fact that the eggs were overdone. My friend and I are firm believes in runny egg. Our server whole hardily agreed with us. The other complaint with my burger was the fact there was no bacon.  The onion rings were to DIE for. Easily the best rings I've EVER had. The fries were good with what  I believe was Rosemary. We ordered a second order of rings and demolished those as well.  Their not horribly expensive either. Two burgers ($28), a half and half ($6) , separate order of rings ($4), a Shake ($10), and a sprite. Total with tax was $49. Our waiter was amazing, and was even nice enough to get us quarters for the Parking Meter.  I just did my math. Apparently he comped my sprite.  That's my biggest complaint, not with the restaurant itself, but the location. Parking is $3 an hour, or they have a paid lot next door for $9.  There appeared to have been a critic in the seat next to us (Judging by the two cameras she had with her, one including a high end camera that doesn't fit in most purses)  The only two things I would change is add a Pretzel bun (Not a requirement, as a lot of people are using them now.) Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing light fluffy bun, I just prefer Pretzel buns more. Also, Runny egg is high on my list. We will be back soon. If they fix the egg problem, this will probably edge out Kuma's as our #1 burger place.",0.9932,0.772,0.155,0.074,0.5255906593406592

2011-11-07,2.0,"Meh. With Kuma's in the city, I really have no reason to ever go here for a burger again. I customized my own, and I've had better at home when my husband makes it. It was just not that tasty; I took three or four bites and didn't really feel the need to eat the rest of it. We paid $13 for it, so I decided to take it home, and the next day when I opened the box, they only gave me half of it. Um, I cut it in half and took four bites. I still want that half. I don't know why they would throw that away. Also, I specifically asked for no pickle, and while it did come out without a pickle on the plate, it unfortunately came out with all of the juice the pickle they took off the plate left behind. So my tomato, lettuce, and bun all tasted like pickle anyway. And the fries were boring and under-seasoned.  If ever I had to go here again, I would only order the chicken wings (which were actually really good) and one of the adult milkshakes. I can't remember the name of the one I ordered -- Night Owl maybe -- but it was the only chocolate one on the menu. It was actually pretty good, and the only thing I ordered that I finished. If you do decide to go, make sure you stay on top of your server.

Overall, you can get out of here for about $20 if you get a burger, fries, and beer (their draft selection is really solid). That may be more than you usually pay for a burger, but these burgers are in a whole other league than what you're used to.  We also had some of the appetizers, the chili wings and bacon wrapped dates are unreal. I'll definitely be getting them next time I come.  In regards to the bar, they have a lot of specialty drinks that according to my friends, are excellent (I just had a bombay and tonic).

Last week we found ourselves at 25 Degrees for a late lunch, I liked the décor, kind of old school with a modern twist.  One thing that I found disturbing was the lighting; they have quite a few very attractive black glass chandeliers loaded up with what felt and looked like 500 watt bulbs.  It was blazing bright, keep your sunglasses on and think about using sun screen...really.   The burgers run about $12 and seasoned fries are ala carte at $4 a pop, I guess real estate is expensive at Clark and Superior but this is pushing the limit for lunch.   The burgers were great, we had a #1 and a #2 and one order of fries are plenty for 2 people.  We also ordered a couple of apps, I would highly recommend the chili-honey wings, a perfect balance of hot and sweet flavor but pass on the potato cheese fritters, very bland.

2011-10-23,4.0,"I have been here three times and have had pretty different -- but very good overall -- experiences each time. The first time, I came with my girlfriend right after it opened and had some of the best service I have ever had.  Not kidding.  Our waitress (I think her name was Michaela, but I could be wrong because it was a few months ago) knew as much about the various menu items as the waiters at Next--it was impressive.  She gave us detailed descriptions of the cheese options, the way the burgers are cooked, and suggested beer pairings.  I ordered the Number One that time and it was pretty good, except the onions were a little bigger and more plentiful than I was hoping.  And, this was when the fries were still $4 each, in addition to the cost of the burger.  I still felt it was worth it, but a little pricey. The second time the service was actually not great at all.  Our male waiter was a little curt and he sadly allowed our glasses to empty, waiting to bring us more beer until we stood up to stop him and get his attention (no, it wasn't that busy that night).  That said, they lowered the price of the fries ($2 for a small side, $4 for a large) and I got another phenomenal burger. The most recent time was Friday when I went with a buddy of mine.  I decided to keep it simple: meat, bread, and a cheese described as ""Indescribably amazing.""  It was all of those things.  Without the distraction of a lot of toppings, I was able to appreciate the quality of the beef and the fact that they nailed cooking it ""medium.""  The cheese was also excellent, but I won't even try to explain the flavor.  It worked well with the burger and, dare I say, a dollop of ketchup.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly, which is exactly what we were hoping for. Each time I have been here, the owner has personally come to my table to make sure everything was going well.  He identified himself the first time, and the second and third time just stopped by to check in.  I appreciate that he actually cares about the experience and about his customers (demonstrated by his adjustment of the prices of the fries, for example). I haven't tried the boozy milkshakes yet because, frankly, they carry some pretty solid beers with really reasonable prices.  Not many places carry Brooklyn Brewing Company, so for $5 a bottle I can't really resist.

2011-10-15,3.0,"I went to 25 Degrees a couple of weeks ago, mostly based on a recommendation from a friend that had been to a few out in California. So, after hearing that one opened up in Chicago, I wanted to give it a shot ASAP, hoping that it would be a good place to go to since it's fairly close to my place.  Service here was very good from the wait-staff. Constant water-refills, friendly, and happily answered my table's many questions. The owners definitely seem to care as they were checking in on us, although they seemed to do so a bit too much; the place opened fairly recently so I suppose they're just trying to make sure that everyone is happy.  Since I was getting a burger, I decided to get a whiskey-spiked caramel milkshake. I probably could have just ordered a beer and been happier, not because of the milkshake itself (it was afterall pretty good), but having a burger + fries + shake can sit in your stomach like a prehistoric boulder for a while.  Given all of that - I was fairly disappointed with the burger itself. I got the ""Number Three"" with the green chile, chipotle, and avocado. It tasted fine, although I was expecting some more heat. But the meat patty itself was fairly sizable and thick, but it was also breaking apart, tasted greasy and almost slimey. The toppings were fine, nothing offensive there. With a better patty, this burger would have been much better. My table agreed. A similar burger from DMK had better flavors in my opinion. We also got a large order of fries for the table, and as expected, everyone gobbled them up. Afterall, they're french fries, and unless it's Burger King, fries are generally loved by all. Fries were the thin-cut variety, nothing special but again, they were good. Overall, I'll probably come back here for drinks and maybe try some other items on the menu...but with the ever-expanding market of ""gourmet burgers"" in Chicago, I'll go somewhere else to get my ground beef-fix.",0.9918,0.81,0.165,0.025,0.5181172839506174

This Burger is thick but not too thick, juicy but not greasy, and is packed with flavor that doesn't overwhelm the meat.  The bun is light and fluffy but adequately holds your piece of meat, a perfect suitor. The toppings are endless with Bacon, Prosciutto, Aioli galore, and a wide variety of cheeses to select from.  The burger I picked out had a creamy cheese, prosciutto, fried egg, and garlic aioli cooked to perfection at Medium Rare. It was very refreshing to actually get a burger cooked to the right temperature specification. As a meat lover, as I'm sure many of you can attest, there is nothing worse than getting an over cooked piece of high quality meat!  The French fries had a subtle thyme seasoning that added just enough flavor as to not overwhelm the fries.

Last, we ordered fries: regular and sweet potato.  The order is MASSIVE so for all the people saying it was too expensive..between four of us we shared an order of half and half with our meal and it was perfect with leftovers even.  The aeoli's were great for dipping.   As for appetizers, we tried them all.  the crispy eggplant topped with spicy tuna was my fave definitely a crowd pleaser.  We were very pleased with all of them.   I'll definitely be back to this spot for game days since there's TVs all over and it's just a relaxed place for some bloodies and games.   nice work 25 degrees - keep it up and look for me soon!",0.9979,0.725,0.275,0.0,0.548700351935646
2011-09-21,4.0,"When a friend suggested that several of us meet at 25 Degrees for an afternoon of football, I went ""huh?"" Going to their website, I was a bit apprehensive because, well, with pink the dominant color and pin-up girls as decoration, I surely thought it would be a weird place to watch football. Not at all. Yes, the decor is a bit swankier: deep mauve (NB: I'm color-illiterate), dark wood, and brown leather booths, but the ambiance is definitely that of a kick-back place to have a few drinks, chill with friends, and perhaps watch a few games. It's like your non-sports bar, but with sports (that makes no sense) While I was there for hours, I preferred to drink my calories for the day. I had heard this place was a bit pricy, but draft beers were $5-6 bucks, which was cheaper than expected, and mixed drinks were comparable to any other River North establishment. I did have the opportunity to sample their potato & three cheese fritters (fantastic), along with a getting an explanation from our friendly bartender about the difference between hush puppies and fritters.  Speaking of friendly bartenders, what makes this place is the servers and the management. The owner was chilling at the bar himself, and super friendly to all the guests. The bartenders and servers were personable, attentive, and just plain fun.  Only negative: they have a garage door that opens up onto Clark Street. While I understand that it attracts interest from passerbys, it was about 45 degrees and raining that day. No need to freeze out your patrons by keeping that door open. Brr. I'm bringing a sweater for next time.  I plan on heading back for burgers, and perhaps a spiked shake (I'm intrigued). Overall, interesting concept, and a bit difficult to categorize, but I like what they are doing with it.",0.9923,0.769,0.177,0.054,0.4668171866447729
2011-09-19,3.0,"I met a friend here for lunch and since we enjoyed cocktails at lunch (a no-no for him), he wishes to remain anonymous, so let's just call him Rishan Q.  We both enjoy a good burger and this place was new so it seemed like a no brainer to give it a try. The decor is described as ""bordello meets burger bar."" I'd say that's an accurate description.  It was pretty empty when we we arrived so maybe word's not out about this place or they're just busier in the evening.  We got menus and a list of cocktails. Immediately I zeroed in on something called ""Redhead in Bed."" As soon as I ordered it, the bartender shouted out from the across the bar ""Everyone should have a redhead in bed!"" Of course this makes us laugh.  The drink was a delicious combination of muddled strawberries, Ketel citroen and mumm napa. My friend (you know, the one who wishes to remain anonymous) wasn't planning on enjoying a cocktail but as soon as he took one sip of mine, he promptly ordered his own ""Redhead in Bed.""  For our burger choices, I stuck with just a basic burger, simply topped with lettuce and tomato and he chose the number 1 which had Gorgonzola, arugula, bacon, and thousand island dressing. We both ordered them medium rare and we also split an order of sweet potato fries.  The food came up quickly and we started to dig in. Lately I've been experiencing a lot of overcooked burgers but the one at 25 Degrees was the opposite -- it was definitely on the rare side. I guess if given the choice I prefer undercooked to overcooked, but the center was so rare that I didn't even eat that part. My friend's burger was also quite rare. Still, they were good, as were the sweet potato fries (and what a huge portion they were).  For a burger place, you could spend quite a bit money here. Burgers start in the $7-$9 range (depending on if you want beef, veggie or turkey) and every topping is at least $1. Add on cheese and a bunch of stuff and you're easily looking at a $14 burger, and that's without fries, which are a la carte.  I liked 25 Degrees just fine. I don't see becoming a regular because I think there are better burgers for less money (and cooked properly to boot), but I wouldn't have a problem coming back again. Especially for that aptly named cocktail.",0.9921,0.849,0.133,0.017,0.5736038084722296
2011-09-13,3.0,"The bf and I have been desperate for a solid burger place to open near us in Near North (too many long cab rides to Kuma's!) so we were really excited to try out 25 degrees. We went on a rainy Friday night and - surprisingly, given the recent press it's been getting - it was not crowded at ALL so we grabbed a cute little bar table. Our waitress was AMAZING - she knew the menu inside and out, was really patient and helpful, and kept the drinks coming. They actually have a decent wine list in addition to a beer list (but not nearly as comprehensive a beer list as many other burger joints).  The burgers are pretty interesting - to be honest, the one I ordered might have been the lowlight of my experience, but I think that's just because I haven't perfected my order yet. Also the fries were very tasty but also don't come with the burgers so you have to order them (and pay for them!) in addition to the burgers. This place is not a bargain, so be careful when you start adding things because your bill can rack up pretty quickly.  I'll definitely be trying it out again to see if it can skyrocket into 4 or 5 stars :)",0.9576,0.797,0.143,0.06,0.579320987654321

They do have a decent selection of draft and bottled beers and other types of drink concotions. Overall, a good spot to check out if you're in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to hit up this burger joint.",0.9486,0.783,0.191,0.026,0.4878427128427128
2011-09-08,2.0,"Since Chicago has no alternative rock music stations, 25 degrees is one of the best places to go to hear some awesome music and get some creative ""diner"" cocktails. BUT there is no other reason to go there.  I had an $8 grilled cheese which was so not worth it. I've had better ones made from Wonder Bread. There was barely any cheese either. AND it didn't come with anything - fries etc.. Service was slow and absent minded. When I got my food neither condiments were offered nor brought. When I finally found the waitress, I asked for sriracha. By the time I got it, my sandwich was cold.  I was looking at the burgers and they will get expensive as you have to pay for each add on.

2011-09-06,3.0,"This place gets one star for the ambiance, one star for the friendly service and one star for the food.  While there was nothing overtly wrong with my experience, it wasn't really all that great.  Our waitress was friendly, the ambiance was unique and the music was great.  I had high hopes for my spiked milkshake, the Pirata; however after 5 nauseating sips I gave up. The sweet potato fries were definitely the food highlight and just about the only leg up 25 degrees has on DMK.  While my burger was decent, $86 for a spiked milkshake, beer, tater tot appetizer, sweet potato fries/onion rings combo and two burgers that were nowhere near as good as DMK or (for that price) the Four Seasons, I doubt we'd go back for anything other than a few beers to watch a game.  This place had potential as a neighborhood gem because its ambiance is definitely something different, but the experience kind of reminded me of eating at Planet Hollywood ... it was fun to see once, but doubt I'll go back.",0.9467,0.822,0.143,0.035,0.5472666666666667

The menu is great, you can craft your own burger or choose from their burgers. I ordered the #1 and wow was it tasty! The burger was topped with caramelized onions, arugula, a mozzarella like cheese, bacon and thousand island..the burger is a pretty decent size and all the flavors just melt in your mouth with each greasy and juicy bite. Definitely recommend ordering some sweet potato fries on the side! The gourmet burgers reminded me of the likes of Kuma's corner and Umami Burger. However I definitely prefer the ambiance of 25 degrees, it's got a chic yet urban look with fancy chandeliers and luxe wallpaper, but still has an urban feel with the exposed brick walls and casual feel. They have a great selection of drinks and shakes, but I'll have to get around to trying those the next time I stop in. Since they just opened they are still working out a couple of kinks as far as training and timing, but overall it was a great dinner and the servers were all really nice.

2011-08-29,5.0,"I'm so excited to have this place finally open! Although you may be tempted to compare it to the current trend of ""gourmet burger"" joints in Chicago, as soon as you walk in you will realize that it's much, much more. The décor and ambiance are chic and classy, but with a fun and energetic vibe. My friend nailed the description as an upscale speakeasy. Oh, and touch the walls - the wallpaper is velvet. Ooh lala! Lucky for me, I was with a group of my foodie friends and we sampled a bunch of stuff on the menu including a few of the specialty burgers - the #2 was my personal fave with a roasted tomato, prosciutto, pesto and burrata cheese. I'm drooling just thinking about it right now. The tuna burger was also incredible with a spicy kick and my vegetarian friend couldn't stop raving about the grilled veggie sandwich, so the menu has something scrumptious for everyone.  One of the unique offerings are spiked milkshakes that are ridiculously awesome. The salted caramel shake with makers mark rocked my world. Gosh, it's great to be an adult.  Personally, I think 25 Degrees blows the other local burger spots out of the water, because it's rare when you can find a place that combines a stellar atmosphere and an inspired, delicious menu. I can see myself spending a lot of time here, whether feasting on a juicy burger or sipping a vodka/st germain/pear puree and thyme cocktail (for realz, it was amazing).
