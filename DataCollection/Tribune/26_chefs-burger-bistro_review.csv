I would recommend this place without hesitation, the only reason I dock one point because it did take a while for our food to come out.",0.9771,0.771,0.229,0.0,0.7194444444444444

It lacked a distinct taste and lacked flavor. I didn't like the grilled onions on the bottom.  The fries were bland and tasteless.  For a place that looks so nice, in such a prime location, the food should be the best in the city. It was not. Far greater burger and fries at Au Cheval, Butcher and the Burger, or Lockdown.

Went with the Groupon and very quickly saw customer service decline rapidly after the gentleman realized we had a Groupon.  My husband waited 15 minutes for his beer to arrive. Not to mention our order showed up in an order that would surprise you: Burgers first, no fries with them and our appetizer toward the end. And our server was hardly around and when he was, he had such an attitude it made the whole experience that much less desirable.  Lastly, the Groupon stated we get two beers or wine, so me being pregnant I ordered tea and my husband was going to take the 2 beers, assuming we'd pay for the tea separately. When we brought it up to the server, when we finally got his attention, he mentioned we already ordered our 2 drinks. Come on, guy, don't try and pull that on us. At least give us the option. And on that note, he wasn't entirely honest about what items we could and couldn't order with the Groupon because our family came previously with the same Groupon and weren't as limited as we were.  We never received a check because our Groupon covered the meal so I don't know the servers name and trying to break our $20 bill to leave a tip was maddening, no one is attentive to customer service in this restaurant. Husband waited 10 minutes at the bar to get change all the while the bartender is ignoring him while flirting with other patrons. Would have asked our server but again, he was no where to be seen.

What was the bistro sauce, response was is like a thousand island,no information added that made it their own.  I may be reaching to far but if a customer of mine was asking about a 22 dollar burger I would make it sound like there was no other burger like it on the planet.   Against my better judgement,  I ordered it.

The Groupon gave us the opportunity to have a drink each, share an app, a burger each, and share a side. That's a lot of food, and it was a very good deal. The beer list is decent, though not all of the beers are described on the menu, which for craft beers, I think is a necessity. At least tell me what kind of ale it is, or if it even is an ale. For our appetizer, we chose one of the flatbreads, which was probably a mistake given we were getting burgers afterwards. We went for the Liguria flatbread and were surprised to find out that those skinny shavings on it were lemon peels, and not cheese. Still, not a bad combination of flavors  with the chicken, roasted red pepper, and pesto.  For our side, my friend chose the truffle fries. I don't like the truffle flavor, but I didn't say anything because I didn't really want to fill up on fries anyway. They come on a large plate, with an egg on top (which is not mentioned in the menu description), and you can find some non truffled fries among them, so I had a couple, and they were tasty. We both opted for build your own burgers, because their gourmet offerings all had both appealing and not so appealing toppings mixed together and it didn't seem right to pick them apart, when we could just make our own. I ordered a medium rare burger with brie and an egg. Loved the brie. The burger was perfectly cooked. The egg was a bit overdone. And yet the burger was still messy and impossible to eat as a whole. My friend ordered the special sauce on the side and she could pick hers up. Good to know. By the way, the special sauce is basically thousand island dressing. All in all, it overfed me and I enjoyed it, though it certainly didn't inspire any I have to come back here again cravings.  The atmosphere itself was alright. The patio was still open and had a few groups out in it. But the restaurant was basically empty. Service was attentive, but then a regular walked in and created a lot of noise right next to us with the bartender, which was distracting and unpleasant. I'm all for old friends reuniting, but not when they're shouting at each other in a small space.

2015-04-08,1.0,"YUCK, YUCK, YUCK, YUCK, YUCK!!! I give this place a 5-Yuck rating. First, if you order delivery, plan on your order being wrong and the restaurant not caring at all that they just threw something at you that you did not order and would not eat (but your incorrect order will be delivered super speedy! Yay)... Have you ever seen those FB posts ""You had one job... Epic fails,"" that is Chef's Burger Bistro. If you have a food allergy BEWARE, they do not adhere to a standard that would involve not killing you via anaphylaxis. Second, the fried pickles are not pickles, they are cucumbers (no vinegar, literally, cucumber) in a deep fried coating with zero seasoning. The ranch is a mayo-tartar combo that promptly made me vomit after two bites. The burger bun is the consistency of that ""yoga-mat"" bread and has a rubbery texture and appearance. The ""Bistro Secret Sauce"" is mayo, thousand island, and pickle bits and smells like egg salad that's been left out on a hot summer day. The meat was falling apart because whatever mystery grade beef they use has a dry, particle consistency and can not hold form like a cooked beef patty should. So the summary of this review is: If you enjoy excessive, warm, spoiled mayonnaise, not getting what you ordered, and paying to be poisoned at a super fast delivery speed- This is the place for you! If you actually value customer service, good food, and getting what you paid for- do not ever order from or eat at this place. Thanks Chef's Burger Bistro for giving me inedible food and involuntary bulimia! EPIC FAIL #EpicFail",0.9547,0.839,0.111,0.05,0.4598484848484848

The burger itself was cooked closer to medium/medium-well...but the Crimes Against Humanity here are the prices for the burger and then the fact that those prices don't include fries.  So, as is, you are looking at about $16-$17 for a burger with fries here.  Sorry, not even close!

Located where Blackies once stood, Chefs Burger Bistro offers up some pretty tasty burgers ( don't like beef?  Try kangaroo, camel or boar instead.  Yep!  I said kangaroo!!). Crazy, right? We went on a sunny Friday afternoon and this place was packed!  After about a 20 minute wait they found us a table for 4 and we were off and running! The decor is quite nice with big circular booths lining the bar area and high tops scattered about.  Hanging over the busy bar are these ruby red fixtures that are suggestive without being overt.  Upstairs- the rooms would be perfect for a party with huge windows open to the patio and skylights letting in the sunshine.  Big globe lights add a contemporary flair. We started with the shrimp ceviche- a little bland but still good.  But then on to the star of the show, the burgers!  And as good as the burgers were- know that they come served on these artisan rolls that are baked in house 3 times daily.  Delicious! I tasted the 50/50 (a burger made with 50% ground bacon and beef) which was the winner at our table for overall taste.  The boar burger was good but it came pretty rare for our table who liked things cooked a little more.  And the camel and kangaroo burger were both lean and tasty. As a side- we went with the duck fat fries and these were delicious! Service was spot on given how busy it was and management stopped by a couple of times to make sure we were all enjoying ourselves! Don't think that because it's a burger place that this is a cheap date.  Average check at our table was $25 a person and no one had a drink.  Guess those camels and kangaroos demand a high price!

2014-09-19,4.0,"Surprised at some of the negative comments here. Never heard of this place before and stopped in for a quick dinner before a movie.  Our meal was two new menu items as of three days ago. The Bistro Flatbread and the Chicago beef. And an old menu item, the duck fat fries.  I am very sensitive to comments about bad service so got a little concerned reading the reviews. Needless to say we had no issues. Our water was promptly refilled, our server educated us on the menu items we had questions on (buns and rolls are made from scratch) and our drinks were refilled as needed.  The fries were amazing. Ordered the Buttermilk Blue sauce for them and didn't need it at all but it was still delicious as well.  Food was great. Service was great. Prices I thought were very reasonable. One exception - $9 for an Anti-Hero seemed a little steep. On the other hand, the $7 I paid for my Dogfish Head 90 minute was more than fair. Overall I'd definitely come back. I'm anxious to try the wings and pastrami tacos!",0.9821,0.787,0.165,0.049,0.5946179183135705

Service was very attentive but not overbearingly so. Prices were higher than we had expected for burgers, but seeing the size of the burgers it made a bit more sense.  Kind of a downer no sides included for the price, however. I had the Ibiza cocktail, which was very refreshing and not too heavy on the liquor, but liquor-y enough to know it was a real drink.  Not too sweet, not too sour. Try the 50/50 burger - 50% bacon and 50% ground beef - it's excellent.  So is the BBQ burger.  For the two of us, we had one 50/50 burger, a side of sweet potato fries, a side of baked red potatoes, and their fresh greens salad plus the Ibiza cocktail and a Sprecher cherry soda.  All this came to about $50.   This gruntles me a little, since I could have been a lot happier spending that $50 on different food.  But then I'm not a huge fan of  food that is fusion, or modern-American, or whatever it's calling itself these days (in the sense that it is ""normal"" food, like a burger or salad, that has been cuisined-up by adding pickled vegetables or artisan this-and-that, contains beets, etc).  I prefer a burger to just be a plain old burger - I'm not above trying new things, but I'm a no-frills person.  So this wasn't 100% my thing, but it was still tasty food cooked well and presently very nicely with excellent service in a lovely atmosphere, plus it's a great location.  I just wasn't expecting the pickled veggies in the salad, which was disappointing to me.

So when the hubby and I moved to the River North neighborhood this past month, we noticed Chef's Burger Bistro just a few blocks from our building, and made sure to check it out. The first time we stopped in was last week. We sat on the patio and really enjoyed ourselves. I had the Paris Burger and my husband, Gary, ordered the Aussie Burger which contains Wagyu meat and is absolutely delicious.   Well, after our first time visiting, we sure knew we would return. We are former restaurant owners from Miami and newly retired so checking out all the local grub places in the River North area has been so fun!  Anywho, yesterday we were on our way to a play, and decided to stop into the Bistro for a cocktail and snack before enjoying our evening on the town. We got to the restaurant around 5, and sat at the bar.  Tom, the bartender, introduced himself to us and was friendly. Shortly after being there, a young, pretty faced girl who appeared to be training behind the bar walked in and we could not help but notice the way Tom was talking to her as soon as she arrived behind the bar. He was speaking to her rather harshly and what appeared to be verbally bombarding her. Although we did not know the context, we could automatically pick up on the negative energy Tom was verbally delivering to this poor girl based off her facial expressions. We could not help but feel bad for the girl because he was talking to her in a manner that we as customers (and former restaurant owners), felt was absolutely unprofessional; especially in front of people seated at the bar. Time and place for everything.  Perhaps we noticed this more than others because we are former long-time industry people ourselves. Regardless, it was disappointing to witness. It was very evident the young girl was upset from being spoken to as she was, and we did not want to sit at the bar any longer. We skipped on the appetizer and closed out with Tom. Went to Seasons 52 for an app instead. In the future, we will return for the burgers. And definitely sit at a table, not the bar.",-0.9603,0.836,0.067,0.097,0.4689792663476874

The problem is service. I just finished up having brunch and was disappointed to see that the menu has been reduced by what looks like half; I'm especially sad to see the malted waffles no longer on the menu. But what really upset me this morning was the entirely inattentive service.

The real mystery here, and other reviewers have pointed this out, is this place is owned by the same people who own Volare, which is across the street. It is a superb Italian restaurant with consistently good service. Why there is such a complete disconnect between the two establishments is beyond me. Ultimately, this hasn't been my only bad experience with service; sometimes, it is excellent but that's only about 1/3 of the time, everything else is anywhere from lackluster to today's round of infuriating. It's a real disappointment to see this establishment fail to get traction with service and to cut back on brunch given that, for locals, there isn't much choice in walking distance besides Yolk, which is mainly geared toward the tourist crowds (and it shows given the ridiculously long waits for good, but not great food).",-0.9458,0.808,0.069,0.123,0.5596491228070175

Too small to hold everything together, it becomes a knife 'n fork meal pretty quickly, especially if you added toppings. (Ask for an extra napkin, in advance.)

Upon entering this eatery, we noticed how contemporary with the light walls, the openness to the bar, just a modern feeling restaurant.  We had opted to sit on the second floor next to an open window.  The view is over the patio and of course the streets of St. Clair and Grand Avenue.   The server, Chandler, greeted us promptly and took our drink order and went over the menu with us.  Jan had ordered the Cuban Burger while I had ordered the Steak & Egg Salad.  Both of our meals were fantastic!!  Chandler would check in with us occasionally without being bothersome.  The salad is a great size - almost the size where you can share it. Of course, we had to try the desserts.... we had ordered the cobbler and the tasting dessert cookies/ice cream.  We both agree the cobbler was outstanding while the tasting dessert cookies were okay.

This is a nice restaurant, and a huge step up from the former old Boston Blackies that was torn down to make way for something befitting the tourist locale.  New developer, new ownership team and now there's a beautiful restaurant with nicely designed spaces (walk upstairs and check out the second floor), a fabulous bar, and a menu that defines what they do best.  I had the bistro burger, a PBJ milkshake (one of the tastiest and thickest milkshakes I've ever had) and a house salad.  $20 without tax & tip.  The meat itself was fabu--tender, grilled to perfection and juicy.  The on-site-made bun was perfection.  It held everything together, even though the toppings and burger would have made the whole thing fall apart on a lesser quality bun. The house salad was fine, but it wasn't thrilling nor added anything special to the meal; just greens and a few veggies.  I wish I had ordered the onion rings--a much better value.  Avoid the fries (which is horrible to say when you're in a burger joint), but they're pricey for the paltry amount you get.

Looked crowded, usually a good sign, so thought we had an hour and a half before movie so we would check it out. Walked in and gave our name to a host who appeared to be more concerned with talking to her coworkers then assisting patrons. We were told approximately a ten minute wait if we weren't looking to sit on patio. After thirty minutes, and seeing some peoples names added to the list. While others who didn't have reservations (standing within earshot of hostess stand so heard these people state they did not have reservations, same size party as mine) seated immediately. I approached the hostess station to ask about the extended wait time as well as seating priority. Though she just seated a couple who walked in with no reservation she stated she had no idea what I was talking about. While talking with one hostess, a couple arrived and spoke to the other hostess stating they had a reservation but were told that things were a bit behind and it would be approximately a thirty to forty five minute wait. Based on other reviews, as well as my thirty minute observation. The staff doesn't appear to have any want to be there nor assist customers. Witnessed many customers speaking to other waitstaff or bus staff trying to get anyone to wait on them. Some staff seemed so disinterested, while others seemed to have that 'attitude' to themselves, forgetting they are employed in a relatively inexpensive establishment. So attitude is not really necessary. Regarding food I can't address, based on most reviews here it appears we didn't miss anything. We ended up leaving and went across the street to Volare. Where one can always count on great food, great service for a very reasonable price. At Volare, management/owner/host all stop by to check on service and quality of meal. The couple who had the reservation and were told they would still have to wait thirty to forty five minutes. They were right behind us at Volare.

The food: We both ordered our burgers medium-rare, but they came out more well-done than we expected (and I feel like a brat for being nit-picky like that). The B50 burger - cool concept. Instead of the usual bacon on top of the burger, they mixed the bacon and beef together.  The Paris burger - the weird thing is that this is probably the best ""smelling"" burger I've ever had. I think the Jam added a unique scent and taste to it. I don't think I've had a burger quite like this before.  The duck-fat fries - I didn't see what the big deal was about these fries. Some reviews mentioned them but they didn't taste any different from usual restaurant fries.  Our server was also strangely lifeless.

The service can still use an improvement. 2 out of the 3 times we've been our waiter disappeared for like 10 minutes and we had to flag someone else down to order a new round of drinks. First of all, the bar there is awesome. They have tons of unique beers that you don't find that often in Chicago, and the other cool part about it is that it's half inside, then half outside on their patio since big windows open up and you can sit at the window and order there. Their bartenders are also very friendly and have great recommendations, so just ask them what they recommend. The most recent time we were there, we ate outdoors on the patio which is always clutch on a nice night in Chicago. Their strawberry milkshake is very good, it was my first time ordering a shake there and wasn't sure if they were going to make it all fancy and ruin the flavor, but it was amazing and I drained that sucker so fast.  Their steakhouse burger is definitely tastey and has a lot of flavor. The Paris burger always seems to be a popular choice for girls.  Most recently I got the French Dip burger, but regretted not going with the B50 Burger (half burger half bacon belly). My french dip burger didn't have that much flavor and was more medium than medium rare.  The Tuna Bahn Mi also looked very good, but I haven't had a chance to try it yet.

2014-02-24,4.0,"Had a great burger and looking forward to going again and trying another.  I went with a group of 4 for lunch on a Monday. Showed up at 12pm and the main seating area was already 75% full, but we did not have to wait at all for a table.  All staff whom we encountered seem to go out of their way to be friendly and helpful.  We sat at a large, 6-seat elevated (bar height) table.  The interior has the look and feel of a contemporary bar.  There aren't a lot of seats on the main floor, but we were told that there is additional seating upstairs, which is only open on Fridays and weekends right now.  The noise level was not obvious; I don't even recall hearing music, and I would classify it as conversation-friendly, at lunchtime.   As for the most important part -- the food, my group was pretty well satisfied.  There were a number of items on the menu that caught our attention, but we all had burgers.  I had one of the chef's ""signature"" burgers, the Iberico, that comes dressed with Manchego cheese, Serrano ham, a fried egg and garlic aioli.  I had the 145 gram burger (which is a 1/3 lb. burger) -- and given the size of the burger, I would guess that they are generous on their portioning.  I probably could not have finished the larger burger option.  I loved the flavor combination of the Iberico burger.  The meat was cooked exactly as I had ordered it (medium).  The beef itself had a decent, but not prominent taste.  There was no overt ""char"" or grilled flavor to the burger patty.  Overall, it was a delicious burger -- not quite on par with the best I've had (Au Cheval, Grange Hall, The Butcher & the Burger), but pretty close.  I felt it was fairly priced, too.  The 1/3 lb. Iberico burger was just $9. Having paid $12 - $18 for gourmet burgers elsewhere, I felt as if I got a decent value. I did have higher expectations from the duck fat fries.  In fact, had I not known ahead of time that they were duck fat fries, I would have just thought they were regular fries.  Here, Chef's Burger Bistro can learn a thing or two from Au Cheval.  One of my companions mentioned that the onion rings were utterly ordinary. The service was friendly and attentive.  However, my soft drink went empty for way too long, and the server only noticed it after we had finished our meal.   But, in the end, Chef's Burger Bistro passes the important test:  we will be back again.  The plethora of options/toppings is unique and I definitely want to try more burger combinations.",0.9959,0.847,0.137,0.016,0.5976968864468865

I made my own burger with bacon and mozzerella.  It was okay, but I've had far better burgers elsewhere in Chicago (Kuma's, 25 Degrees, even Five Guys).   For my side, the server recommended the mini fingerling potatoes, but they tasted gross.  They were coated in some kind of weird oil that tasted like WD-40 or something.  I tried using salt, butter and even ketchup without much success.

Also, please lose this gram thing. It's very annoying.",-0.0617,0.795,0.097,0.109,0.5807575757575758

I can not wait to try their burgers next! The prices were good for the quality and amount of food.",0.9384,0.752,0.248,0.0,0.6
2014-02-02,2.0,"I'm giving Chef's Burger Bistro 2 stars, BUT I'm sure once they work out some of the new restaurant kinks they can make this place a 3 star restaurant. I've been waiting for this place to open since FOREVER!! I live so close to the location and was always seeing the sign saying opening on this date, opening on that date. So when they finally opened I was thrilled because I always like it when new eating spots open in my neighborhood and because I love burgers. I went to Chef's Burger Bistro with a friend and we thought: Positives 1) Everyone was super friendly from the time we entered the establishment until the time we walked out. 2) They have a nice menu of cocktails and beers. 3) Nice selection of burgers and I like that you can build your own as well. 4) They have a nice size patio, which I am sure will be a hit come the summer time for Happy Hours. Negatives 1) Space wise it's a little tight on the 1st floor. The 2 person tables are right up against each other so I had the pleasure of having my chair bumped every time the lady behind me moved. Also, there's like no walk space for the staff between the bar and the tables. While the waitress was trying to take our orders about 7 staff members walked by and she had to lean into our table to let them by. 2) Lacking Red Bull and BBQ sauce. My friend ordered a vodka & red bull, but they had no red bull. My friend asked for a side of BBQ and was told they didn't have BBQ sauce. In this day and age every restaurant with a functioning bar NEEDS to have red bull. I mean I don't like red bull, but I'd think that 1 out of every 50 customers would ask for a vodka red bull. Also, I would think that every restaurant serving burgers would be stocked with BBQ sauce...maybe I'm wrong. 3) Food was a little bland.       - We ordered the devilish eggs, and you get 6 of them which is AWESOME and they all have different fillings, BUT they were bland which was totally disappointing. I feel like if they had added some type of seasoning to the filling these would have been so much better.     - The burgers (we both did the build a bite burger) were a good size, but we both agreed they war flavorless. Again, I feel these burgers would have been so much better if they had some flavor. I mean give me some garlic salt, seasoning salt, heck any McCormick or Mrs. Dash seasoning would have helped. 4) The waitress waiting on us could not tell us which drinks on the cocktail menu were her favorite because she hadn't tried any of them. Unless she is underage or in AA, I don't understand how you can work somewhere that serves alcohol and not have tried one drink on the menu. I feel bad being so negative and rating this place 2 stars since they just opened, HOWEVER, I really do think this place will get some of these things worked out and get to that 3 - 31/2 star range soon (hopefully).",0.9847,0.812,0.131,0.057,0.5901843835177167

2014-02-01,5.0,"Amazing atmosphere with delicious food!!!...Definitely the new spot to eat well....The staff are amazingly friendly and happy to see you walk through the door. The rolls are fresh and soft, the burgers are hand crafted and complimented with high quality ingredients and I especially loved the duck fat and sweet potato french fries. I plan to eventually try everything on the menu!!!",0.9857,0.617,0.383,0.0,0.6267768595041322
2014-02-01,5.0,I've visited twice this week and can't wait to go back!  I plan on trying everything on their menu.  The staff is extremely helpful and the food was all around amazing!   I recommend the wings and shrimp tacos!   As far as the burgers are concerned you're safe with any choice.  Extremely tasteful and a great size!   It's a great addition to the area.,0.9726,0.705,0.295,0.0,0.7375
2014-01-29,4.0,"My nifty boss saw that the place had finally opened today and took a few of us out for lunch. The place is great with comfy booths and really nice decor.  It also looks as if it is set up for an open pass-through bar (to the exterior once the weather warms up).  The outdoor patio is going to be amazing. As for the food, it was delicious.  Those at the table ordered the In and Out (cheddar stuffed and cheddar topped) which was pretty amazing.  The duck fat fries were really good.  We also ordered the fried pickles which were outstanding--especially with the honey mustard dressing. Overall the experience was nice.  They had the typical opening day jitters--food took almost an hour to be served, staff a little unsure of the menu, and the temperature in the place was on the cold side. Will definitely come back to try the other menu items in a couple of weeks after the opening pains are ironed out and update the review.",0.9848,0.794,0.183,0.023,0.6458333333333334
